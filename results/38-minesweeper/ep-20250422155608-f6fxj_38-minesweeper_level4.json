I need to figure out the first move in this Minesweeper game. The board is 9x9, but wait, the current board shown has 18 rows? Wait, no, maybe that's a mistake. Oh, the user probably made a formatting error. The actual Minesweeper is 9x9, so the current board display here is probably a typo, showing 18 rows of '?', but I should ignore that. The standard first move in Minesweeper is usually to uncover a cell in the middle or a corner, but since all cells are unknown, the best strategy is to pick a corner to start, like (0,0) or (0,8), (8,0), (8,8). Let's choose (0,0) as the first move. So the action would be to uncover (0,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the rows are listed with 18 elements each? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the user probably pasted the board with each row having 18 characters, but the actual Minesweeper is 9x9. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps I should focus on the cells that are visible.\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. The win condition is either flagging all 10 mines correctly or uncovering all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ total mines (10), so we need to flag as many correct mines as possible.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse some rows. Let's take row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" — maybe the columns are 0-8, so perhaps the first 9 elements are row 0. Wait, 9 columns, so each row should have 9 entries. The input shows 18 entries per row, which is confusing. Maybe it's a formatting mistake, but perhaps the user intended each row to be 9 cells. Let's assume that, maybe the input was split into two parts. For example, row 0 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" and then \"0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\", but that's 16 elements. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is displayed with each row having 18 cells, but that's not standard. Maybe the user made a mistake in pasting. Let's check the problem statement again. The board is 9x9, so 9 rows, 9 columns. The input shows 18 rows? No, the current board has 18 lines. Oh, maybe that's a mistake. Wait, the user wrote \"Current Board:\" followed by 18 lines. That can't be right. Maybe it's a formatting error where each row is split into two lines. For example, row 0 is the first two lines: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" and the next line, but that's 18 columns. That's not a 9x9 grid. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board representation. Let's ignore that for a moment and think about standard Minesweeper strategy. The key is to find cells that are definitely safe (can be uncovered) or definitely mines (can be flagged).\n\nIn Minesweeper, when a numbered cell shows a number, that's the count of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. If a cell with number N has exactly N adjacent '?' cells, then those must be mines. Conversely, if a cell with number N has more than N adjacent '?' cells, but some are already flagged, then the remaining '?' cells may be safe.\n\nLooking for such patterns. For example, let's take a cell that's a number and has adjacent '?'s. Let's say in row 2 (third line), the entry is \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ?\". Assuming columns 0-8, maybe row 2 is \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\". Then column 3 is 1, column 4 is 0, etc. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is presented correctly, and I need to look for obvious safe cells. For example, cells marked '0' mean all adjacent cells are safe, so their adjacent '?' can be uncovered. Let's say there's a '0' cell; all 8 surrounding cells are safe. So if a '0' is uncovered, we can uncover all adjacent '?'.\n\nLooking at the first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". If there's a '0' in (0,0), then all adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. But if those are already uncovered (since they are 0s), maybe there's a 0 cell with adjacent '?'.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's a number with all adjacent cells except one being known, so the last '?' must be a mine or safe. For example, if a cell shows '1' and has only one adjacent '?', then that '?' is a mine. If a cell shows '1' and has two adjacent '?' but one is already flagged, then the other is safe.\n\nBut given the confusion in the board display, perhaps the best approach is to look for a '0' cell that has adjacent '?' cells, which can be safely uncovered. For example, if there's a 0 at (row, col), then all 8 neighbors are safe, so any '?' next to it can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first few rows have 0s, which indicate that their adjacent cells are safe. For example, if row 0, column 0 is 0, then (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are 0, which are safe. If row 2 has a 0, say at (2,0), then (2,1), (1,0), (1,1), etc., are safe.\n\nBut without a clear board structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display, and the actual board is 18x18, but the problem states 9x9. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is displayed with each row as a line, and each cell is separated by a space. Let's count the number of cells per row. The first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" — that's 18 cells. The second line is the same. The third line: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ?\" — 18 cells. So 18 rows, each with 18 cells? That's 18x18, but the problem says 9x9. That's a contradiction. So perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the board.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should make a guess. Since the user wants an action, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which is safe. For example, if there's a 0 in (2,0), then (2,1) is 1, which is already uncovered. Maybe look for a '?' adjacent to a 0. Let's say in row 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" — if that's row 12, column 6 is 1, column 7 is 1, column 8 is 1. Maybe (12,5) is 0, so (12,6) is 1, which is adjacent to (11,5), (11,6), (11,7), etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is a 18x18, but the problem says 9x9. This is a problem. Given the confusion, maybe the best move is to pick a cell that's likely safe. For example, in Minesweeper, the corners are often safe, but that's a heuristic. Alternatively, look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, if a 0 is at (row, col), then all 8 neighbors are safe. So any '?' next to a 0 can be uncovered.\n\nAssuming that, let's look for a 0 cell with adjacent '?'. Let's take row 13: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — maybe (13,0) is 0, (13,1) is 0, (13,2) is 0. Their adjacent cells would be (12,0), (12,1), (12,2), (14,0), (14,1), (14,2), etc. If those are 0s, then their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the board to be 9x9, and the input has a formatting error where each row is split into two lines. For example, row 0 is the first two parts: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" and \"0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\", making 9 columns. But that's 16 elements, which is still not 9. This is too confusing.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to choose a cell that's marked '?' and is adjacent to a 0, which is safe. For example, if there's a 0 at (2,0), then (2,1) is 1, which is uncovered. Maybe (3,2) is '?', and if (3,1) is 1, which is adjacent to (3,2), but without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since the game ends at the 100th epoch, and we need to maximize the score, perhaps uncovering a cell that's likely safe is better. Let's pick a cell that's in a region with many 0s, which are safe. For example, row 13 has many 0s, so adjacent cells might be safe. Let's say (13,3) is 1, (13,4) is 1, (13,5) is 1. Their adjacent cells could be (14,3), (14,4), (14,5), which are in row 14: \"0 1 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\". So (14,4) is '?', which is adjacent to (13,3)=1, (13,4)=1, (13,5)=1, (14,3)=2, (14,5)=2, etc. Maybe (14,4) is a mine, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's a '?' and is adjacent to a 1 with only one '?'. For example, if a cell shows 1 and has only one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. But if it has two '?'s and one is already flagged, then the other is safe.\n\nBut without a clear board, it's hard. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in a corner, like (0,0), but (0,0) is 0, which is already uncovered. The first line starts with 0s, so those are already uncovered. The '?' cells are the unknown ones. Let's find a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, if a 0 is at (row, col), then all 8 neighbors are safe. So any '?' next to a 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" — maybe (12,6) is 1, (12,7) is 1, (12,8) is 1. The cell (12,5) is 0. So (12,5) is 0, so its adjacent cells (11,4), (11,5), (11,6), (12,4), (12,6), (13,4), (13,5), (13,6) are safe. If (12,6) is 1, which is already uncovered, then (11,6) might be a '?'. If (11,6) is '?', then it's safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, in row 3: \"0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". Assuming (3,2) is '?', and (3,1) is 1. The 1 at (3,1) has adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). If (2,0) is 0, (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (3,0) is 0, (4,0) is 0, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. Then the 1 at (3,1) has adjacent mines count 1. The adjacent '?' is (3,2). If the 1 at (3,1) has only one mine in its adjacent cells, and (3,2) is the only '?', then (3,2) must be a mine. But if there are other possible mines, then it's not.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. Let's say in row 2, column 12 is 1 (but this is unclear). Alternatively, pick a cell that's in a safe area. Since the user needs an action, I'll have to make a guess. Let's choose (3,4). Wait, the example input has 'uncover (3,4)'. Maybe that's a hint. Or maybe (3,2) is a '?', so uncovering (3,2) could be safe. Alternatively, (4,5) is '?', let's check.\n\nIn row 4: \"0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 3 ?\". So (4,5) is '?'. The cell (4,6) is 1. The 1 at (4,6) has adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is 1, (3,7) is 0, (4,7) is 0, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 0. So the 1 at (4,6) has adjacent mines count 1. The adjacent '?' is (4,5). So if (4,5) is a mine, that would make the count 1. But maybe (4,5) is safe. Alternatively, the 3 at (4,16) (if that's a column) has 3 adjacent mines, but this is unclear.\n\nGiven all this, I'll pick a '?' cell that's adjacent to a 0, assuming it's safe.

The goal is to flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags over total mines (10). \n\nSince it's the first move, the best strategy is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. In Minesweeper, the first move usually doesn't hit a mine (though the problem says the game ends if you uncover a mine, so maybe it's possible). But typically, the first move is safe. So I should pick a corner or edge to start. Let's choose (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but maybe the center? No, corners are easier. Let's go with (0,0). So the action would be 'uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's start by understanding the problem. The user is playing Minesweeper, and we need to make a move.

Oh, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display. But regardless, the first cell (0,0) is uncovered as '1', meaning there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. Since it's the start, the best first move is usually to uncover a cell that's adjacent to known numbers to get more information. But the only known cell is (0,0) with a '1'. Let's list the adjacent cells of (0,0): (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). These are the three cells around it. Since (0,0) is 1, one of these three has a mine.\n\nBut since all other cells are unknown, maybe the best first move is to uncover a cell that's not adjacent to (0,0) to minimize the risk. For example, (8,8) is a corner, far from (0,0). Alternatively, maybe (4,4) as a central cell. But in Minesweeper, the first move is often safe, but the problem states the game ends if you uncover a mine. So we need to pick a cell that's likely safe.\n\nAlternatively, since (0,0) is 1, maybe uncovering (0,1) would help. If (0,1) is a number, we can get more info. Let's think: if (0,0) is 1, then one of (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) is a mine. If we uncover (0,1) and it's a number, say 1, then we know that among its adjacent cells, one is a mine. But maybe (0,1) is safe. Let's pick (0,1) first. Wait, but maybe (0,0) is the top-left, so (0,0) is row 0, column 0. The adjacent cells are row 0, column 1; row 1, column 0; row 1, column 1.

Let's start with that. So I'll uncover (0,0).\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 12x12 grid, but wait, the problem says it's a 9x9 grid. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll focus on the given board.\n\nLooking at the current board, the cells are represented with numbers, '?', and 'F' (but there are no Fs here yet since Flags are 0\/11). The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly. The score is correct flags over 10, so we need to flag all 10 mines.\n\nLet's look for cells that can be determined as safe or mines. Let's start with cells that have numbers indicating adjacent mines. For example, in row 3 (0-based), column 9 is '1', and column 10 and 11 are '?'. Let's check row 3: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". So (3,9) is 1. Its adjacent cells would be the 8 around it. Let's list the coordinates around (3,9):\n\nRow 2, cols 8-10: (2,8)=0, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1\nRow 3, cols 8-10: (3,8)=0, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?\nRow 4, cols 8-10: (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1\n\nWait, (3,9) is 1, so there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list those adjacent cells:\n\n(2,8), (2,9), (2,10), (3,8), (3,10), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10).\n\nNow, check which of these are already known. (2,8)=0, (2,9)=1 (but 1 is a number, not a mine), (2,10)=1 (number), (3,8)=0, (4,8)=1 (number), (4,9)=1 (number), (4,10)=1 (number). The only unknown here is (3,10). So the 1 mine must be in (3,10) or is there a mistake? Wait, no. The number in a cell is the count of mines in adjacent cells. So (3,9) is 1, meaning exactly one of its 8 neighbors is a mine. The neighbors are:\n\n(2,8) is 0 (safe), (2,9) is 1 (safe, since it's a number), (2,10) is 1 (safe), (3,8) is 0 (safe), (3,10) is '?', (4,8) is 1 (safe), (4,9) is 1 (safe), (4,10) is 1 (safe). So all the known neighbors are safe (since numbers are not mines). Therefore, the only possible mine in the neighbors of (3,9) is (3,10). Therefore, (3,10) must be a mine. Wait, but (3,9) is 1, so exactly one mine in adjacent cells. If all other adjacent cells are safe, then (3,10) must be the mine. So we should flag (3,10).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. Let's look at row 4: \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\". The cell (4,2) is '?'. Let's check the cell (4,1) which is 2. (4,1) has value 2, so two mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (4,1) are:\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2).\n\n(3,0) is 0 (safe), (3,1) is 1 (safe), (3,2) is 1 (safe), (4,0) is 1 (safe), (4,2) is '?', (5,0) is '?', (5,1) is '?', (5,2) is '?'. So (4,1)=2, which means two mines among these 8. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nAnother cell: row 5: \"? ? ? 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". (5,3)=2. Adjacent cells would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (5,4)=1 (safe), (6,3)= '?', (6,4)=1 (safe). So (5,3)=2, so two mines in adjacent cells. (4,2) is '?', (5,2) is '?', (6,2) is '?'. Maybe that's a cluster.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (3,10) again. If (3,9)=1, and all other adjacent cells are safe (since they are numbers, which are not mines), then (3,10) must be a mine. So flagging (3,10) would be correct. Let's check the adjacent cells of (3,10). (3,10) is in row 3, column 10. Its neighbors are (2,9), (2,10), (2,11), (3,9), (3,11), (4,9), (4,10), (4,11). (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1. All these are numbers, so they are safe. So if (3,10) is a mine, then (3,9) being 1 makes sense because (3,10) is adjacent. Then (3,11) is '?'. Let's check (3,11). (3,11) is adjacent to (2,10), (2,11), (2,12) but wait, the grid is 12 columns? Maybe the initial description was wrong, but the user provided a 12x12 board. Anyway, (3,11) is adjacent to (2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,10)=? (which we think is a mine), (3,11) itself, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1. If (3,10) is a mine, then (3,11)'s adjacent mines would include (3,10) if it's a mine. Let's see (2,11)=1. (2,11) is 1, so one mine in its adjacent cells. (2,11) adjacent cells: (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,10), (2,12), (3,10), (3,11), (3,12). (2,10)=1, (3,10)=?, (3,11)=?, others are unknown. So (2,11)=1, which might have (3,10) as the mine, making (3,10) a mine. That supports our earlier conclusion.\n\nAnother cell: (4,8)=1. Its adjacent cells: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (3,7)=0, (3,8)=0, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,9)=1, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=1, (5,9)=0. So (4,8)=1 means one mine in these. (5,7) is '?', others are numbers (safe). So (5,7) could be a mine? If (4,8)=1, and all others are safe, then (5,7) is a mine. Let's check (5,7): (5,7) is '?'. Its adjacent cells include (4,6)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1. (5,6)=1, (5,8)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1 are all numbers. So if (5,7) is a mine, then (4,7)=1 (which has adjacent cells including (5,7)) would make sense. (4,7)=1: adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=1. So (4,7)=1: one mine in adjacent cells. If (5,7) is a mine, that's the one. So (5,7) is a mine. So that's another possible mine to flag.\n\nBut let's go back. The current Flags are 0\/11, which is probably a typo (should be 0\/10). The user needs to flag all 10 mines. Let's look for cells that must be safe, so we can uncover them. For example, in row 3, column 4 is 0. (3,4)=0 means no mines in adjacent cells. So all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's list (3,4)'s adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,4)=0, so all these cells are safe. Let's check their current state:\n\n(2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0 (from row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" → (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0)\n(3,3)=1 (row 3: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → (3,3)=1)\n(3,5)=0 (row 3, col 5 is 0)\n(4,3)=1 (row 4: \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" → (4,3)=1)\n(4,4)=0 (row 4, col 4 is 0)\n(4,5)=0 (row 4, col 5 is 0)\n\nAll these are already uncovered (numbers or 0), so no new info there.\n\nAnother 0 cell: (4,4)=0. Its adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=2, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=0. All are uncovered, so nothing new.\n\n(5,5)=0: adjacent cells are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1 (row 4, col 6=1), (5,4)=1, (5,6)=1 (row 5, col 6=1), (6,4)=1 (row 6: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → (6,4)=1), (6,5)=0 (row 6, col 5=0), (6,6)=1 (row 6, col 6=1). All are uncovered, so no new info.\n\n(6,5)=0: adjacent cells are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=1, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=1 (row 7: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (7,4)=1), (7,5)=0 (row 7, col 5=0), (7,6)=0 (row 7, col 6=0). All are uncovered.\n\n(7,5)=0: adjacent cells (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=0 (row 8: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\" → (8,4)=0), (8,5)=1 (row 8, col 5=1), (8,6)=1 (row 8, col 6=1). All are uncovered.\n\n(8,4)=0: adjacent cells (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,3)=1 (row 7, col 3=1), (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=0 (row 8, col 3=0), (8,5)=1, (9,3)=1 (row 9: \"? ? 1 1 1 3 ? ? ? ? 1 0\" → (9,3)=1), (9,4)=1 (row 9, col 4=1), (9,5)=3 (row 9, col 5=3). All are uncovered.\n\n(9,5)=3: This is a number, so 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's list them: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). (8,4)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,6)='?', (10,4)='?', (10,5)='?', (10,6)='?'. So (9,5)=3 means 3 mines in these 8 cells. (8,4) is safe, (8,5) and (8,6) are numbers (safe), (9,4) is number (safe). So the 3 mines must be in (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). But not sure yet.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (3,10) we thought might be a mine, but let's see if there's a cell that's safe. Let's check (3,11) in row 3, column 11, which is '?'. Its adjacent cells: (2,10), (2,11), (2,12) (but maybe the grid is 12 columns), (3,10), (3,12), (4,10), (4,11), (4,12). (2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1. These are all numbers (safe). So if (3,10) is a mine (as per (3,9)=1), then (3,11) is adjacent to (3,10) (mine), so (3,11) would have at least 1 mine in its adjacent cells. But (3,11) is '?', and we don't know if it's a mine or not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 5, column 9: (5,9)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,8), (4,9), (4,10), (5,8), (5,10), (6,8), (6,9), (6,10). (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=1, (5,10)=0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (5,10)=0), (6,8)=1 (row 6, col 8=1), (6,9)=0 (row 6, col 9=0), (6,10)=0 (row 6, col 10=0). (5,9)=0 means no mines in adjacent cells, so all these are safe. (5,10)=0 is already uncovered, (6,9)=0, (6,10)=0 are uncovered. So nothing new.\n\nLet's check row 7, column 2: (7,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1)='?', (6,2)='?', (6,3)='?', (7,1)='?', (7,3)=1 (row 7, col 3=1), (8,1)='?', (8,2)=1 (row 8, col 2=1), (8,3)=0 (row 8, col 3=0). (7,2)=2 means two mines in these 8. (7,3)=1 is safe, (8,3)=0 is safe, (8,2)=1 is safe. So the mines are in the '?' cells here. Not helpful yet.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells with '?' that are adjacent to 0s. Since 0 means no adjacent mines, all adjacent '?' to 0s are safe and can be uncovered. Let's find 0 cells and their adjacent '?' cells.\n\nLooking at (3,4)=0, adjacent cells are all uncovered. (4,4)=0, same. (5,5)=0, same. (6,5)=0, same. (7,5)=0, same. (8,4)=0, same. (5,9)=0, same. (6,9)=0, (6,10)=0, (7,9)=0 (row 7: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (7,9)=0), (7,10)=0, (7,11)=0. (7,9)=0: adjacent cells (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,8), (7,10), (8,8), (8,9), (8,10). (6,8)=1, (6,9)=0, (6,10)=0, (7,8)=0 (row 7, col 8=0), (7,10)=0, (8,8)=1 (row 8, col 8=1), (8,9)=1 (row 8, col 9=1), (8,10)=1 (row 8, col 10=1). All are uncovered.\n\n(8,9)=1: adjacent cells (7,8), (7,9), (7,10), (8,8), (8,10), (9,8), (9,9), (9,10). (7,8)=0, (7,9)=0, (7,10)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,10)=1, (9,8)='?', (9,9)='?', (9,10)=1 (row 9, col 10=1). (8,9)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. (9,8) and (9,9) are '?', others are safe. So possible mine in (9,8) or (9,9), but not sure.\n\nLet's check (3,10) again. (3,9)=1. The adjacent cells to (3,9) are (2,8)=0, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=0, (3,10)='?', (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1. All the known cells are safe (numbers), so the only possible mine is (3,10). Therefore, (3,10) must be a mine. So we should flag it: 'flag (3,10)'.\n\nBut wait, the user's current Flags are 0\/11. Maybe the 11 is a typo, but the problem states 10 mines. So flagging (3,10) would be a correct flag if it's a mine. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let's confirm: (3,9) is 1, which counts the number of mines in adjacent cells. If (3,10) is a mine, then (3,9) has 1 mine, which matches. All other adjacent cells to (3,9) are numbers (not mines), so yes, (3,10) is a mine. So the action should be to flag (3,10).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,10)","flag (3,10)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided the current board state, and I need to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. \n\nFirst, let's recall the game rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 12 rows and 12 columns? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, probably the rows and columns are labeled 0-8, but the current board is presented with 12 rows and 12 columns, which might be a mistake. Wait, no, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the input here has a typo. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the Current Board: It's written as 12 rows, each with 12 numbers. That's confusing. Maybe the actual rows and columns are 0-8, so perhaps the numbers are displayed in a way that's misaligned. Let's ignore that for a moment and focus on the relevant parts.\n\nThe score is 0.0909, which is 1\/11, so the user has flagged 1 mine correctly out of 11 flagged. Wait, the Flags line says 1\/11, meaning 1 correct flag out of 11 total flags. That's bad because there are only 10 mines. So they have 11 flags, but only 1 is correct, so 10 are incorrect flags. The Unflags are 0, so they haven't unflagged any.\n\nThe win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse a section. Let's take row 3, which is \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ?\". So row 3, columns 0-11. Columns 9 is 1, column 10 is F (flagged), column 11 is ? (unknown). But since the grid is 9x9, the valid coordinates are (row, col) where row and col are 0-8. So maybe the board is presented with some extra numbers, but the actual grid is 9x9. So rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nLet's assume that the current board's rows 0-8 and columns 0-8 are the actual grid. Let's list the cells:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (assuming columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] (since the 9th element is 1, maybe column 8 is 1)\nRow 3: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0] (columns 0-8), then column 9 is 1, 10 is F, 11 is ? (but those are beyond 8)\nRow 4: [1,2,?,1,0,0,1,1,1]\nRow 5: [?,?,?,2,1,0,1,?,1]\nRow 6: [?,?,?,2,1,0,1,1,1]\nRow 7: [?,?,2,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [?,?,1,0,0,1,1,1,1]\n\nWait, maybe the board is presented with 12 columns but the actual game is 9x9, so columns 0-8. So each row's first 9 elements are the actual cells. Let's focus on that.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The goal is to uncover all safe cells (non-mine) to win, or flag all 10 mines. Since the user has 11 flags (Flags: 1\/11), they have 11 cells flagged, but only 1 is a correct mine. That means 10 of the flags are incorrect. So unflagging those might help, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet. However, the task is to choose an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nLet's look for cells that are known to be safe. For example, a cell with a number indicates the number of mines in adjacent cells. If a cell is uncovered and shows a number, and the number of adjacent flags equals that number, then the remaining adjacent ? cells are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 8 (assuming 0-8). Row 3 is \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ?\" — so row 3, column 8 is 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So any adjacent ? cells to a 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's check row 4, column 0: it's 1. Adjacent cells would be (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is 0, (3,1) is 1, (4,1) is 2, (5,0) is ?, (5,1) is ?. The 1 in (4,0) means there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells. Since (3,0) is 0 (unlikely a mine), (3,1) is 1 (uncovered, so not a mine), (4,1) is 2 (uncovered, not a mine). So the mine must be in (5,0) or (5,1). But not sure yet.\n\nRow 2, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells are (1,7), (1,8), (2,7), (3,7), (3,8). Let's see: (1,7) is 0 (row 1, column 7), (1,8) is 0 (row 1, column 8), (2,7) is 0 (row 2, column 7), (3,7) is 0 (row 3, column 7), (3,8) is 0 (row 3, column 8). So 5 adjacent cells, all uncovered as 0. The 1 in (2,8) means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells, but all adjacent are uncovered, which is a contradiction. Maybe my grid parsing is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is presented with rows 0-11 and columns 0-11, but that's not possible. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's look at the example given in the input format: 'uncover (3,4)' which is (row, col) with 3 and 4, so 0-8.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 10 is F (flagged). But (3,10) is outside the 9x9 grid, so that's an invalid flag. The user has 11 flags, which includes invalid coordinates, hence 1 correct out of 11. So those flags on invalid coordinates are definitely wrong. So maybe unflagging those would help, but the user's action could be to unflag an invalid flag. But the problem is to choose an action, which could be uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, in row 3, column 4 is 0 (from \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ?\" — row 3, column 4 is 0). A 0 cell means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So adjacent cells to (3,4) would be (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check their current state.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 0. Let's list the coordinates around (3,4):\n\n(2,3): row 2 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" — column 3 is 0.\n\n(2,4): row 2, column 4 is 0.\n\n(2,5): row 2, column 5 is 0.\n\n(3,3): row 3 is \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ?\" — column 3 is 1.\n\n(3,5): row 3, column 5 is 0.\n\n(4,3): row 4 is \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" — column 3 is 1.\n\n(4,4): row 4, column 4 is 0.\n\n(4,5): row 4, column 5 is 0.\n\nSo all these adjacent cells are either 0, 1, or 0. Since (3,4) is 0, all adjacent cells are safe, so any adjacent ? cells can be uncovered. Let's check if any of these adjacent cells are ?.\n\nLooking at (2,3): 0 (uncovered), (2,4): 0 (uncovered), (2,5): 0 (uncovered), (3,3): 1 (uncovered), (3,5): 0 (uncovered), (4,3): 1 (uncovered), (4,4): 0 (uncovered), (4,5): 0 (uncovered). So none of the adjacent cells to (3,4) are ?. So maybe another 0 cell.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4: 0 (from row 4: \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" — column 4 is 0). So (4,4) is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). \n\n(3,3): 1 (uncovered), (3,4): 0 (uncovered), (3,5): 0 (uncovered), (4,3): 1 (uncovered), (4,5): 0 (uncovered), (5,3): 2 (row 5 is \"? ? ? 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — column 3 is 2), (5,4): 1 (row 5, column 4 is 1), (5,5): 0 (row 5, column 5 is 0). \n\nSo (5,5) is 0 (uncovered), (5,4) is 1 (uncovered), (5,3) is 2 (uncovered). So no ? cells adjacent to (4,4).\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — column 5 is 0). Adjacent cells to (5,5): (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6).\n\n(4,4): 0 (uncovered), (4,5): 0 (uncovered), (4,6): 1 (row 4, column 6 is 1), (5,4): 1 (uncovered), (5,6): 1 (row 5, column 6 is 1), (6,4): 1 (row 6: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — column 4 is 1), (6,5): 0 (row 6, column 5 is 0), (6,6): 1 (row 6, column 6 is 1). \n\nSo (5,5) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe. Are any of these adjacent cells ? Let's check (4,6) is 1 (uncovered), (5,6) is 1 (uncovered), (6,4) is 1 (uncovered), (6,5) is 0 (uncovered), (6,6) is 1 (uncovered). No ? here.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0 (row 6: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — column 5 is 0). Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6).\n\n(5,4): 1 (uncovered), (5,5): 0 (uncovered), (5,6): 1 (uncovered), (6,4): 1 (uncovered), (6,6): 1 (uncovered), (7,4): 1 (row 7: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — column 4 is 1), (7,5): 0 (row 7, column 5 is 0), (7,6): 0 (row 7, column 6 is 0). \n\nSo (7,5) is 0 (uncovered), (7,6) is 0 (uncovered). No ? here.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0 (row 7: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — column 5 is 0). Adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6).\n\n(6,4): 1 (uncovered), (6,5): 0 (uncovered), (6,6): 1 (uncovered), (7,4): 1 (uncovered), (7,6): 0 (uncovered), (8,4): 0 (row 8: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\" — column 4 is 0), (8,5): 1 (row 8, column 5 is 1), (8,6): 1 (row 8, column 6 is 1). \n\n(8,4) is 0 (uncovered), (8,5) is 1 (uncovered), (8,6) is 1 (uncovered). No ? here.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 0 (row 8: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\" — column 4 is 0). Adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n\nWait, row 8 is the last row (since 9x9 grid is 0-8), so row 9 is invalid. So (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) are outside the grid. So valid adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5).\n\n(7,3): 1 (row 7, column 3 is 1), (7,4): 1 (row 7, column 4 is 1), (7,5): 0 (row 7, column 5 is 0), (8,3): 0 (row 8, column 3 is 0), (8,5): 1 (row 8, column 5 is 1). All uncovered, no ?.\n\nLet's look for a cell with a number where the adjacent flags plus known mines equal the number, so the rest are safe. For example, row 4, column 1 is 2 (row 4: \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" — column 1 is 2). Adjacent cells to (4,1): (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2).\n\n(3,0): 0 (uncovered), (3,1): 1 (uncovered), (3,2): 1 (uncovered), (4,0): 1 (uncovered), (4,2): ? (unknown), (5,0): ? (unknown), (5,1): ? (unknown), (5,2): ? (unknown).\n\nThe 2 in (4,1) means there are 2 mines in these 8 adjacent cells. The uncovered cells (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0) are all safe (since they are numbers, not mines), so the 2 mines must be in (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). But we don't have flags here yet, so not sure.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 2 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — column 3 is 2). Adjacent cells: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\n(4,2): ? (unknown), (4,3): 1 (uncovered), (4,4): 0 (uncovered), (5,2): ? (unknown), (5,4): 1 (uncovered), (6,2): ? (unknown), (6,3): 2 (row 6, column 3 is 2), (6,4): 1 (uncovered).\n\nSo the 2 in (5,3) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The uncovered cells (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4) are safe. So possible mines in (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). \n\nRow 6, column 3 is 2 (row 6: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — column 3 is 2). Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4).\n\n(5,2): ? (unknown), (5,3): 2 (uncovered), (5,4): 1 (uncovered), (6,2): ? (unknown), (6,4): 1 (uncovered), (7,2): 2 (row 7, column 2 is 2), (7,3): 1 (uncovered), (7,4): 1 (uncovered).\n\nSo 2 mines in adjacent cells. Safe cells are (5,3), (5,4), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). So possible mines in (5,2), (6,2).\n\nIf (5,3) has 2 mines, and (6,3) also has 2 mines, and their overlapping adjacent cells are (5,2) and (6,2), then perhaps (5,2) and (6,2) are mines. Because (5,3) adjacent: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). (6,3) adjacent: (5,2), (6,2). If (5,3) needs 2 mines, and (6,3) needs 2 mines, and the only overlapping cells are (5,2) and (6,2), then those two must be mines. That would satisfy both 2s. So (5,2) and (6,2) are mines. Then, (4,2) (adjacent to (4,1)'s 2) would be safe, because (4,1) has 2 mines, and if (5,2) and (6,2) are mines, that's 2, so (4,2) is safe. So (4,2) can be uncovered.\n\nLet's check (4,2): row 4, column 2 is ? (from row 4: \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" — column 2 is ?). If (4,2) is safe, then uncovering it would be a good move. \n\nSo based on this logic, (4,2) is safe and can be uncovered. Let's verify:\n\n(4,1) is 2. Its adjacent cells: (4,2) is ?, (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) is ?, (6,2) is ?. If (5,2) and (6,2) are mines (2 mines), then (4,2) must be safe, because 2 mines are already accounted for. So (4,2) can be safely uncovered.\n\nTherefore, the action should be to uncover (4,2).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,2)","uncover (4,2)"],"unflags":0,"seed":18,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

First, I need to look at the current board and see what information I have. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the displayed board here seems to have 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, the user probably pasted it wrong. Wait, the Minesweeper rules say it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the current board is presented with each row separated. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines: there are 19 lines, each with 19 characters. That's probably a mistake. But according to the rules, it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the user made a typo. Let's assume that the first 9 rows are the actual 9x9 board. Let's parse the first 9 rows:\n\nRow 0: ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → Wait, that's more than 9 cells. Oh, maybe it's a formatting issue where each row is written with spaces, but the actual columns are 9. Let's correct that. Maybe each row has 9 cells. Let's see:\n\nAssuming each row is 9 cells, let's re-express the first few rows properly. Maybe the user separated the cells with spaces, so for example, the first row is:\n\nRow 0: ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (since 9 cells). Then the next part \"0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" might be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the current board is displayed correctly, but the user input has a formatting error. Let's focus on the visible numbers which are safe cells.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a 0 means none of the adjacent cells have mines, so all adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered automatically. Let's look for 0s in the current board.\n\nLooking at the first row (assuming the first line is row 0), there's a \"0\" at position (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8). Because the first row starts with \"? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0...\", so columns 2-8 in row 0 are 0. That's a big area of 0s. When you uncover a 0, all adjacent cells are safe, and they get uncovered automatically. So if there's a 0, the adjacent cells are safe, and any cells adjacent to those 0s can be safely uncovered.\n\nLet's take row 0, column 2: (0,2) is 0. Its adjacent cells would be (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). But (0,1) is 1, (0,3) is 0, (1,1) is 1, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 1. Since (0,2) is 0, all adjacent cells have 0 mines, but (0,1) is 1, which indicates there's 1 mine adjacent to (0,1). Wait, maybe I need to map this correctly.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in the first row, after the initial \"?\", there's a \"1\" at (0,1), then 0s from (0,2) to (0,8). So (0,2) is 0. The 0 at (0,2) means that none of the 8 surrounding cells have mines. The surrounding cells of (0,2) are:\n\n- (0,1): which is 1 (already uncovered)\n- (0,3): 0 (uncovered)\n- (1,1): 1 (uncovered)\n- (1,2): 1 (uncovered)\n- (1,3): 1 (uncovered)\n- The cells above (0,2) don't exist since it's row 0.\n- The cells to the left are (0,1), which is covered.\n\nWait, maybe the 0s in row 0, columns 2-8 are all uncovered, which means that their adjacent cells are safe. So any cell adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered safely. For example, row 1, column 2 is 1 (from the second line: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → maybe row 1 has \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2\" as the first 9 cells). So row 1, column 5 is 0 (since the fifth column is 0). That 0 in row 1, column 5 (1,5) would have adjacent cells. Let's check (1,5) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells would be:\n\n- (0,4), (0,5), (0,6)\n- (1,4), (1,6)\n- (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\nIf (1,5) is 0, then all these cells are safe. Looking at row 0, column 5 is 0 (from row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → maybe (0,5) is 0). So (0,5) is 0, which is already uncovered. (1,4) in row 1 is 1 (since row 1 has \"1 1 1 1 0...\", so (1,4) is 1). (1,6) is 1 (row 1, column 6 is 1). Then (2,4), (2,5), (2,6) are currently \"?\" (since row 2 is \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ...\" → row 2, column 4 is 1, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 1). So (2,5) is 0, which is uncovered, so that's safe.\n\nSo, the 0s in the upper part of the board indicate that large areas are safe. The cells that are \"?\" and adjacent to these 0s can be safely uncovered. For example, let's look for a \"?\" that is adjacent to a 0. Let's take row 0, column 0: it's \"?\". What's adjacent to (0,0)? The adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1) is 1 (uncovered), (1,0) is \"?\" (row 1 starts with \"?\", so (1,0) is \"?\"), (1,1) is 1 (uncovered). Since (0,1) is 1, which has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The 1 at (0,1) has adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,2) is 0 (no mine), (1,1) is 1 (uncovered), (1,2) is 1 (uncovered). So the 1 at (0,1) must have exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (0,0) and (1,0). So one of these two is a mine. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAnother area: row 2, column 5 is 0 (from row 2: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ...\" → (2,5) is 0). So (2,5) being 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (2,4) is 1 (uncovered), (2,6) is 1 (uncovered), (1,4) is 1 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). So the unknown cells here are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Since (2,5) is 0, these three cells (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) must be safe. Therefore, we can safely uncover (3,4), (3,5), or (3,6).\n\nLooking at the current board, row 3 is \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ...\", so (3,5) is 0 (uncovered), (3,4) is 1 (uncovered), (3,6) is 1 (uncovered). Wait, maybe row 3's columns 4,5,6 are 1,0,1. So (3,5) is 0. Then (3,5) being 0 means its adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells would be (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (3,6) is 1, so the unknown ones are (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Since (3,5) is 0, those three are safe. So (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) can be uncovered safely.\n\nBut let's go back to the initial 0s. The first row has a lot of 0s. For example, (0,8) is 0 (assuming row 0 has 9 columns: (0,0) is ?, (0,1) is 1, (0,2)-(0,8) are 0s). The 0 at (0,8) has adjacent cells: (0,7) (0,8's left, which is 0), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) is 0 (uncovered). (1,7) in row 1 is 1 (from row 1: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2...\" → (1,7) is 1). (1,8) is 2 (row 1, column 8 is 2). So (0,8) is 0, so (1,7) and (1,8) are adjacent, but they are already uncovered. So maybe the 0s in row 0, columns 2-8 have already been processed, and their adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nThe next area with 0s is row 1, column 5 (1,5) is 0. Let's confirm: row 1 is \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2...\" so (1,5) is 0. The adjacent cells of (1,5) are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (0,4) is 0 (from row 0), (0,5) is 0, (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 1, (1,6) is 1, (2,4) is 1 (row 2: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1...\" → (2,4)=1), (2,5) is 0 (row 2, column 5=0), (2,6)=1. All these are uncovered, so the 0 at (1,5) is correct.\n\nThen row 2, column 5 (2,5) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1 (row 3: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 1...\" → (3,4)=1), (3,5)=0 (row 3, column 5=0), (3,6)=1. All uncovered, so that's correct.\n\nRow 3, column 5 (3,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2 (row 4: \"? ? ? ? 2 2 2...\" → (4,4)=2), (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2. So (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are 2s, which are uncovered. So the 0 at (3,5) is correct.\n\nSo the 0s form a vertical line from row 0, column 5 down to row 3, column 5. That's a safe column. Now, looking at the cells that are \"?\" and adjacent to known numbers. Let's look for a \"?\" that is definitely safe.\n\nFor example, let's look at row 0, column 0: it's \"?\". The adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1. The 1 at (0,1) has adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,2)=0, (1,0), (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1. Since (0,2) is 0 (no mine), (1,1) and (1,2) are 1 (uncovered, so not mines). So the 1 at (0,1) must have exactly 1 mine in (0,0) and (1,0). So either (0,0) or (1,0) is a mine, but we can't tell which. So we can't safely uncover those yet.\n\nAnother area: row 4, column 4 is 2. Let's see its adjacent cells. (4,4)=2. The adjacent cells are (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=?, (4,5)=2, (5,3)=?, (5,4)=?, (5,5)=?. The 2 at (4,4) means there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. (3,4)=1 (uncovered, not a mine), (3,5)=0 (not a mine), (4,5)=2 (uncovered, not a mine). So the possible mines are in (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). But we don't have enough info.\n\nLet's look for a \"?\" that is adjacent to a 0. Since 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, any \"?\" adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's check where the 0s are. The 0s are in:\n\nRow 0, columns 2-8 (assuming row 0 has 9 columns: (0,2) to (0,8) are 0s)\nRow 1, column 5 (1,5) is 0\nRow 2, column 5 (2,5) is 0\nRow 3, column 5 (3,5) is 0\n\nSo the 0 at (0,8) (row 0, column 8) has adjacent cells (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered. The 0 at (0,2) (row 0, column 2) has adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nThe 0 at (1,5) (row 1, column 5) has adjacent cells (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nThe 0 at (2,5) (row 2, column 5) has adjacent cells (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nThe 0 at (3,5) (row 3, column 5) has adjacent cells (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nSo all the 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Now, let's look for numbers that can help us. For example, the 1 at (0,1) (row 0, column 1) has adjacent cells (0,0)=?, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1. As before, (0,2) is 0 (no mine), (1,1) and (1,2) are 1 (uncovered, not mines). So the 1 at (0,1) must have 1 mine in (0,0) and (1,0). So one of them is a mine.\n\nThe 1 at (1,1) (row 1, column 1) has adjacent cells (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?. The 1 at (1,1) must have 1 mine in these 8 cells. (0,1)=1 (not a mine), (0,2)=0 (not a mine), (1,2)=1 (not a mine). So the possible mines are (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But since (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,0) and (1,0), let's say (0,0) is a mine, then (1,0) is safe. Then (1,1) would have 1 mine (0,0), so the other cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are safe. Alternatively, if (1,0) is a mine, then (0,0) is safe, and (1,1) has 1 mine (1,0), so (2,0), etc., are safe. So in either case, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are safe. So we can uncover (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2) safely.\n\nBut maybe there's a better cell. Let's look at row 4, column 7,8, etc. The current board shows row 4 as \"? ? ? ? 2 2 2 ? ? ? ...\", so (4,7), (4,8) are \"?\". Let's check adjacent numbers. The 2 at (4,6) (row 4, column 6) has adjacent cells: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=2, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=?. The 2 at (4,6) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (3,5)=0 (no mine), (3,6)=1 (no mine), (4,5)=2 (no mine). So possible mines in (3,7), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). Not enough info.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is surrounded by 0s. Since all the 0s' adjacent cells are uncovered, maybe the next step is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a number but has a known count. For example, the 1 at (0,1) has two possible mines, but we can't flag yet. So maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nWait, let's think about the initial moves. In Minesweeper, the first move is usually safe, but here the game is already in progress. The current board has some uncovered cells, so we need to find a \"?\" that is safe.\n\nLooking back, the 0s in row 0, columns 2-8 mean that all cells adjacent to them are safe. Since those 0s are in row 0, their adjacent cells in row 1 would be (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). Let's check row 1: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2...\" So (1,2)=1, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. These are all uncovered, so the 0s in row 0 have already revealed their adjacent cells.\n\nNow, let's look at row 2, column 0: \"?\". Its adjacent cells are (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. The 1 at (1,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which we discussed earlier. If (1,0) is a mine, then (2,0) is safe. If (0,0) is a mine, then (1,0) is safe, so (2,0) could be safe. But this is uncertain.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at the 100th epoch, so we need to make moves that uncover safe cells to reach the win condition (uncover all safe cells). The safe cells are all cells that are not mines. There are 9x9=81 cells, 10 mines, so 71 safe cells. The current board has some uncovered cells. Let's count how many are uncovered.\n\nLooking at the first 9 rows (assuming 9x9):\n\nRow 0: ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → 8 uncovered (columns 1-8), 1 covered (column 0)\nRow 1: ? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2 → 8 uncovered (columns 1-8), 1 covered (column 0)\nRow 2: ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ? → 3 uncovered (columns 4-6), 6 covered (columns 0-3,7-8)\nRow 3: ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ? → 3 uncovered (columns 4-6), 6 covered (columns 0-3,7-8)\nRow 4: ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 ? ? → 3 uncovered (columns 4-6), 6 covered (columns 0-3,7-8)\nRows 5-8: all ? → 9 covered each\n\nSo total uncovered cells:\n\nRow 0: 8\nRow 1: 8\nRow 2: 3\nRow 3: 3\nRow 4: 3\nRows 5-8: 0 each\nTotal: 8+8+3+3+3 = 25 uncovered cells.\n\nSafe cells are 71, so we need to uncover 71-25=46 more. To win, we need to uncover all safe cells. So we need to find safe cells to uncover.\n\nThe cells that are definitely safe are those adjacent to 0s, but we already checked those. Another way is to find cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, so the remaining adjacent cells are safe. But there are no flags yet (Flags: 0\/36).\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number with all other adjacent cells known. For example, the 1 at (0,1) has two adjacent unknown cells: (0,0) and (1,0). Since the 1 needs exactly 1 mine, the other cell is safe. But we don't know which is the mine, so we can't be sure. However, if we uncover one of them, if it's a mine, the game ends. If it's safe, we get information.\n\nBut maybe there's a better cell. Let's look at row 2, column 5: it's 0. Its adjacent cell (3,5) is 0. (3,5) is 0, so (4,5) is 2 (uncovered). (4,5)=2 has adjacent cells: (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2, (4,6)=2, (5,4)=?, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?. The 2 at (4,5) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (3,4)=1 (not mine), (3,5)=0 (not mine), (3,6)=1 (not mine), (4,4)=2 (not mine), (4,6)=2 (not mine). So possible mines in (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). But not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: the cells in row 0, column 0 is \"?\", and row 1, column 0 is \"?\". Since (0,1)=1, and (1,1)=1, maybe uncovering row 1, column 0 would be better. But if (1,0) is a mine, the game ends.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the right side of the board. Row 0, column 9 is mentioned as \"1 ? ? ? ...\", but that's probably a formatting error. Let's focus on the 9x9 grid.\n\nWait, maybe the current board is displayed with each row as a line, but the user made a mistake in pasting, showing 19 rows instead of 9. Let's assume that the first 9 lines are the 9 rows of the 9x9 grid, each with 9 cells. For example:\n\nRow 0: ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: ? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 2\nRow 2: ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 ? ?\nRow 4: ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 ? ?\nRow 5: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 6: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 7: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nYes, that makes sense. So row 0 has 9 cells: (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=0, (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0.\n\nRow 1: (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2.\n\nRow 2: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?.\n\nRow 3: (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?.\n\nRow 4: (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=?.\n\nRows 5-8: all cells are ?.\n\nNow, let's analyze row 0, column 8 (0,8)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered, so nothing new.\n\nRow 1, column 8 (1,8)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?. The 2 at (1,8) means there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The known cells: (0,7)=0 (no mine), (0,8)=0 (no mine), (1,7)=1 (no mine). So the mines must be in (2,7) and (2,8). So (2,7) and (2,8) are mines. Wait, that's a key insight!\n\nLet's verify: (1,8)=2. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,7): 0 → no mine\n- (0,8): 0 → no mine\n- (1,7): 1 → no mine (since it's a number, not a mine)\n- (2,7): ?\n- (2,8): ?\n- (0,9): doesn't exist (since it's 9x9)\n- (1,9): doesn't exist\n- (2,9): doesn't exist\n\nSo only (2,7) and (2,8) are adjacent and unknown. Since (1,8)=2, there must be 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The only possible cells are (2,7) and (2,8). Therefore, both (2,7) and (2,8) must be mines. That's a sure thing!\n\nIf that's the case, then we can flag (2,7) and (2,8). But the current action could be to flag them, but let's confirm.\n\nWait, (1,8)=2. The 8 adjacent cells are:\n\nTop: (0,7), (0,8)\nMiddle: (1,7), (1,9) (invalid)\nBottom: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) (invalid)\nLeft: (1,7) is already counted.\n\nSo valid adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8). That's 5 cells. (0,7)=0 (no mine), (0,8)=0 (no mine), (1,7)=1 (no mine). So 3 safe cells. The 2 mines must be in the remaining 2 cells: (2,7) and (2,8). Yes! So (2,7) and (2,8) are mines. Therefore, we should flag them. But the current score is 0.0, and flags are 0\/36 (maybe a typo, should be 0\/10 since there are 10 mines).\n\nBut the user's current Flags are 0\/36, which might be a mistake, but according to the rules, there are 10 mines. So flagging (2,7) and (2,8) would increase the correct flags.\n\nBut let's check another number to confirm. Let's look at (1,7)=1. (1,7)=1's adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?.\n\n(0,6)=0 (no mine), (0,7)=0 (no mine), (0,8)=0 (no mine), (1,6)=1 (no mine), (1,8)=2 (no mine), (2,6)=1 (no mine). So the adjacent cells are 7 cells, 6 are safe, so (1,7)=1 must have 1 mine in (2,7) or (2,8). Which matches our previous conclusion that (2,7) and (2,8) are mines (since (1,8)=2 needs 2 mines there, and (1,7)=1 needs 1 mine there). So (2,7) and (2,8) are mines. That's correct.\n\nSo we can flag (2,7) and (2,8). But let's see if there are other mines we can identify.\n\nNext, look at (2,6)=1. (2,6)=1's adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?.\n\n(1,5)=0 (no mine), (1,6)=1 (no mine), (1,7)=1 (no mine), (2,5)=0 (no mine), (3,5)=0 (no mine), (3,6)=1 (no mine). So the adjacent cells are 8 cells, 6 are safe, so (2,6)=1 must have 1 mine in (2,7) or (3,7). We already know (2,7) is a mine, so (3,7) must be safe. Therefore, (3,7) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nYes! Because (2,6)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. We know (2,7) is a mine (from (1,8)=2), so the other adjacent unknown cell (3,7) must be safe. Therefore, (3,7) is safe.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover (3,7), as it's definitely safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,7)","uncover (3,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but wait, looking at the input, the current board has 19 rows? Wait, no, maybe it's a formatting issue. Wait, the Minesweeper game rules say it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown here has more than 9 rows. Maybe that's a mistake in the input, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe goal is to uncover a safe cell or flag a mine. The win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10. So, I need to find a cell that's safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Let's list each row:\n\nRow 0: ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? (Wait, 9 columns? No, 9x9 should be 9 columns per row. Maybe the input has a typo, perhaps each row is 9 cells. Let's check again. Maybe the user made a mistake in separating the rows. Alternatively, maybe it's a 19x19 grid? But the rules say 9x9. Hmm, perhaps the current board is misformatted, but I'll try to focus on the cells that have numbers which can help.\n\nLet's look for cells with 0, which when uncovered, automatically uncover all adjacent cells. For example, in row 0, there's a '0' at (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8). Wait, if a cell is '0', that means all 8 adjacent cells have no mines. So if a cell is '0', all adjacent '?' cells can be safely uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ?\" Maybe this is row 0 with columns 0-8: let's assume that each row is 9 characters. Let's split each row into 9 cells. For example, row 0: [\"?\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"], row 1: [\"?\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\"], etc. That makes more sense. Let's adjust:\n\nRow 0: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow 2: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow 4: [?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0]\nRow 5: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0]\nRow 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 3, ?, 2, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nAh, that's a 9x9 grid. The original input probably had each row's cells separated by spaces, and maybe the user pasted them in a single line with line breaks, but splitting into 9 cells per row makes sense. Let's confirm: 9 rows, each with 9 cells.\n\nNow, let's analyze the cells. The '0's are safe and their adjacent cells are also safe. For example, in row 0, column 2 is '0'. The adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) would be:\n\n(0,2) is 0. Adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). But (0,1) is '1', which is already uncovered. (0,3) is '0' (already uncovered). (1,1) is '1' (uncovered), (1,2) is '1' (uncovered), (1,3) is '1' (uncovered). So maybe that 0 is already processed.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 8: (4,8) is '0'. Its adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8). (3,7) is '1', (3,8) is '2', (4,7) is '1', (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '0'. So (5,8) is '0', which is a 0. Let's check (5,8): adjacent cells are (4,7), (4,8), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8). (4,7) is '1', (4,8) is '0', (5,7) is '1', (6,7) is '2', (6,8) is '0'. (6,8) is '0', so (6,8) is 0. Its adjacent cells: (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8). (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '0', (6,7) is '2', (7,7) is '1', (7,8) is '0'. (7,8) is '0', adjacent cells: (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). (6,7) is '2', (6,8) is '0', (7,7) is '1', (8,7) is '1', (8,8) is '0'. (8,8) is '0', adjacent cells: (7,7), (7,8), (8,7). All are uncovered.\n\nSo these 0s in the bottom right are already processed. Let's look for other 0s. Row 7, column 4 is '0' (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]). So (7,4) is 0. Adjacent cells are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). Let's list them:\n\n(6,3): 2 (row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 3, ?, 2, 0]) → (6,3)=2\n(6,4): 2\n(6,5): 3\n(7,3): 1 (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]) → (7,3)=1\n(7,5): 1\n(8,3): 1 (row 8: [?, ?, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]) → (8,3)=1\n(8,4): 0\n(8,5): 1\n\nSo (7,4) is 0, which means all adjacent cells have 0 mines. But the adjacent cells here are (7,3)=1, (7,5)=1, (8,4)=0, etc. Wait, no. The '0' in a cell means that the 8 surrounding cells have 0 mines. So if a cell is uncovered as 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe (no mines) and should be uncovered. So if a cell is displayed as 0, that means it's already been uncovered, and its adjacent cells are either uncovered or should be safe to uncover.\n\nLooking for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, let's take (8,4) which is 0 (row 8, column 4). Its adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) but since it's 9x9, rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So (8,4) adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (since 8 is the last row, no row 9). (7,3)=1 (uncovered), (7,4)=0 (uncovered), (7,5)=1 (uncovered), (8,3)=1 (uncovered), (8,5)=1 (uncovered). So no '?' there.\n\nAnother 0 is (7,8) (row 7, column 8). Its adjacent cells are (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). (6,7)=2 (uncovered), (6,8)=0 (uncovered), (7,7)=1 (uncovered), (8,7)=1 (uncovered), (8,8)=0 (uncovered). No '?' here.\n\nLet's look at row 2, column 5: (2,5) is 0 (row 2: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]). So (2,5)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Let's check these:\n\n(1,4)=1 (row 1: [?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]) → (1,4)=1 (uncovered)\n(1,5)=0 (uncovered)\n(1,6)=1 (uncovered)\n(2,4)=1 (row 2: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (2,4)=1 (uncovered)\n(2,6)=1 (uncovered)\n(3,4)=1 (row 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2] → (3,4)=1 (uncovered)\n(3,5)=0 (uncovered)\n(3,6)=1 (uncovered)\n\nSo (2,5) is 0, and all adjacent cells are uncovered. No '?' here.\n\nRow 3, column 5: (3,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2 (row 4: [?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0] → (4,4)=2), (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2. All these are uncovered except maybe (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) which are 2 (uncovered). So no '?' here.\n\nRow 1, column 5: (1,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (0,4)=0 (row 0: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → (0,4)=0 (uncovered)), (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that can help us find safe cells. For example, a cell with '1' that has only one '?' adjacent, which must be a mine. But since we need to uncover safe cells, maybe find a '?' that is adjacent to a number, and the number's count of adjacent '?'s plus flagged mines equals the number, so the rest are safe.\n\nAlternatively, look for '?' cells that are not adjacent to any numbers, which are likely safe (but in Minesweeper, all cells are either mine or safe, but 0s are safe and their adjacent are safe).\n\nWait, let's look at row 0, column 0: it's '?'. What's adjacent to it? (0,0) adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1)=1 (uncovered), (1,0)=? (row 1, column 0 is '?'), (1,1)=1 (uncovered). So (0,0) is adjacent to (0,1)=1, which has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (0,1) is 1, so it has 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,2)=0 (uncovered), (1,1)=1 (uncovered), (1,2)=1 (uncovered). So (0,1) has adjacent cells: (0,0)=?, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=1 (uncovered). Wait, (0,1) is 1, so it must have exactly 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The 8 adjacent cells of (0,1) are:\n\n(0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (since row 0 can't go up, column 1 can't go left beyond 0, right to 2). So (0,1) is at (row 0, column 1), so adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1): invalid (row -1)\n(row-1, col): invalid\n(row-1, col+1): invalid\n(row, col-1): (0,0) → ?\n(row, col+1): (0,2) → 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col-1): (1,0) → ?\n(row+1, col): (1,1) → 1 (uncovered)\n(row+1, col+1): (1,2) → 1 (uncovered)\n\nSo (0,1) has 3 adjacent cells that are '?': (0,0), (1,0). Wait, (row+1, col-1) is (1,0), (row, col-1) is (0,0). The other adjacent cells are (0,2)=0 (safe, no mine), (1,1)=1 (uncovered, not a mine), (1,2)=1 (uncovered, not a mine). So (0,1) has 2 '?' adjacent cells: (0,0) and (1,0). Since (0,1) is 1, exactly one of these two must be a mine. But we can't be sure which, so maybe not safe to uncover here.\n\nLet's look at row 2, column 0: (2,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=? (row 1, column 0 is '?'), (1,1)=1 (uncovered), (2,1)=? (row 2, column 1 is '?'), (3,0)=? (row 3, column 0 is '?'), (3,1)=? (row 3, column 1 is '?'). Not helpful.\n\nRow 5, column 0: (5,0) is '?'. Let's check row 5: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0]. So (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0. (5,8) is 0, so adjacent cells (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=2, (6,8)=0. All uncovered. (5,7)=1: adjacent cells are (4,6)=2, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=?, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=2, (6,8)=0. So (5,7)=1 has two '?' adjacent cells: (5,6) and (6,6). So (5,7) is 1, so one of (5,6) or (6,6) is a mine. Not sure.\n\nRow 6, column 0: (6,0) is '?'. Row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 3, ?, 2, 0]. (6,3)=2, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=3, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=2, (6,8)=0. (6,3)=2: adjacent cells are (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?, (5,4)=?, (6,2)=?, (6,4)=2, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0. So (6,3)=2 has several '?'s, not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a cell that's definitely safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 0, then it's safe. Wait, all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered, as per the board. So maybe look for a '?' that is in an area where all adjacent numbers have their mine counts satisfied, making the '?' safe.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 8, column 0: (8,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells are (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (8,1)=?, (since row 8 is the last row, no row 9). (8,2)=1 (row 8: [?, ?, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] → (8,2)=1). (8,2)=1's adjacent cells: (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=invalid, (9,2)=invalid, (9,3)=invalid. So (8,2)=1 has three '?' adjacent cells: (7,1), (7,2), (8,1). So (8,2)=1 has 1 mine among those three. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: the safest move is to uncover a cell that is in a corner or edge with no adjacent numbers, but in Minesweeper, the first move is usually safe, but here we don't know. Alternatively, look for a '?' that is surrounded by 0s. Wait, row 0, column 5 is 0 (row 0: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). So (0,5)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nWait, let's check row 7, column 4: (7,4)=0. Its adjacent cells are (6,3)=2, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=3, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=1. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nWhat about row 2, column 7: (2,7) is '?'. Row 2: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]. (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?. Let's check (2,6)=1 (row 2, column 6=1). (2,6)=1's adjacent cells are (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1. So (2,6)=1 has one '?' adjacent cell: (2,7). Since (2,6)=1, that '?' (2,7) must be a mine. Wait, (2,6)=1 means there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list them:\n\n(1,5)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(1,6)=1 (safe, no mine)\n(1,7)=1 (safe, no mine)\n(2,5)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(2,7)=? (unknown)\n(3,5)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(3,6)=1 (safe, no mine)\n(3,7)=1 (safe, no mine)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (2,7) are safe (no mines). Therefore, (2,6)=1 must have exactly 1 mine, which is (2,7). So (2,7) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,7). But wait, the current action could be to flag, but the user might want to uncover a safe cell. Alternatively, if (2,7) is a mine, then (2,8) which is adjacent to (2,7) and other numbers might be safe.\n\nWait, (2,8) is '?'. Let's check (2,8)'s adjacent cells. (2,8) is at row 2, column 8. Adjacent cells are (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,7)=?, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=2. (1,8)=2 (row 1: [?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2] → (1,8)=2). (1,8)=2's adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (since row 1, column 8 is the last column, no column 9). So (1,8)=2 has two '?' adjacent cells: (2,7) and (2,8). We already determined (2,7) is a mine (from (2,6)=1). So (1,8)=2 needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. If (2,7) is a mine, then (2,8) must also be a mine to make the total 2. But (2,6)=1 only has (2,7) as a mine, which is correct. (1,8)=2 would then have (2,7) and (2,8) as mines. So (2,8) is a mine. So (2,7) and (2,8) are mines.\n\nBut let's confirm. (3,8)=2 (row 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2] → (3,8)=2). (3,8)=2's adjacent cells are (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,7)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0. So (3,8)=2 has two '?' adjacent cells: (2,7) and (2,8). If both are mines, that's 2, which matches the 2. So that's consistent. So (2,7) and (2,8) are mines.\n\nBut maybe I should look for a safe cell. Let's look at row 5, column 8: (5,8)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=2, (6,8)=0. All uncovered. So no help.\n\nRow 4, column 8=0: same as above.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 0: '?'. Let's see if it's safe. The adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1. (0,1)=1 has adjacent cells (0,0)=?, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1. (0,2)=0 is safe, so (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,0) or (1,0). So 50% chance, not safe.\n\nRow 1, column 0: '?'. Adjacent to (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?. (0,1)=1 and (1,1)=1 both have (1,0) as adjacent. (1,1)=1's adjacent cells are (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?. So (1,1)=1 has multiple '?'s, can't determine.\n\nLet's look at row 6, column 8=0. Adjacent cells (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,7)=2, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 8=0: same.\n\nRow 8, column 8=0: same.\n\nHow about row 4, column 0: '?'. Row 4: [?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0]. (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0. (4,7)=1's adjacent cells are (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=2, (4,6)=2, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0. So (4,7)=1 has one '?' adjacent cell: (5,6). So (5,6) must be a mine. Because (4,7)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,6)=1 (safe)\n(3,7)=1 (safe)\n(3,8)=2 (safe)\n(4,6)=2 (safe)\n(4,8)=0 (safe)\n(5,6)=? (unknown)\n(5,7)=1 (safe)\n(5,8)=0 (safe)\n\nSo only (5,6) is unknown, so it must be a mine. Therefore, (5,6) is a mine. So we can flag (5,6), but the user might want to uncover a safe cell.\n\nIf (5,6) is a mine, then (4,6)=2 (row 4, column 6=2) has adjacent cells. Let's check (4,6)=2's adjacent cells: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=2, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=1. So (4,6)=2 has two '?' adjacent cells: (5,5) and (5,6). Since (5,6) is a mine, then (5,5) must not be a mine (because 2 mines needed, and (5,6) is one, so (5,5) could be the other or not). Wait, (4,6)=2 needs 2 mines. (5,6) is a mine, so there's 1 mine left. So (5,5) might be a mine or not.\n\n(5,5) is in row 5: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0]. So (5,5)=?. Let's check (5,4)=? (row 5, column 4=?), (5,5)=?, (5,6)=? (mine). (4,5)=2 (row 4, column 5=2) has adjacent cells: (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2, (4,6)=2, (5,4)=?, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?. So (4,5)=2 has three '?' adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Since (5,6) is a mine, (4,5)=2 needs 2 mines, so one of (5,4) or (5,5) is a mine.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is in a region with 0s, but all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Alternatively, look for a '?' that is in a corner, like (0,0), but it's risky. Alternatively, check if there's a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nWait, let's look at row 8, column 4=0 (row 8: [?, ?, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]). (8,4)=0. Its adjacent cells are (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=1. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 7, column 4=0 (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]). (7,4)=0. Adjacent cells are (6,3)=2, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=3, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 5=0 (row 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]). (3,5)=0. Adjacent cells are (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2, (4,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 5=0 (row 1: [?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]). (1,5)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 0, column 2=0 (row 0: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). (0,2)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,3)=0, (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Now, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number with all other adjacent cells known. For example, a '1' with 7 known safe cells and 1 '?', which must be a mine. But we need to find a '?' that is safe.\n\nLet's take row 2, column 3: (2,3)=? (row 2: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]). (2,4)=1 (row 2, column 4=1). (2,4)=1's adjacent cells are (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=?, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. So (2,4)=1 has two '?' adjacent cells: (2,3) and (3,3). So (2,4)=1 has 1 mine in these two. So one of them is a mine, the other is safe. But we can't know which.\n\nRow 3, column 3=? (row 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]). (3,4)=1 (row 3, column 4=1). (3,4)=1's adjacent cells are (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=?, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=2, (4,5)=2. So (3,4)=1 has three '?' adjacent cells: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3). So 1 mine among three, so 2\/3 chance safe. Maybe.\n\nRow 4, column 3=? (row 4: [?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0]). (4,4)=2 (row 4, column 4=2). (4,4)=2's adjacent cells are (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=?, (4,5)=2, (5,3)=?, (5,4)=?, (5,5)=?. So (4,4)=2 has five '?' adjacent cells. Not helpful.\n\nHow about row 6, column 6=? (row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 3, ?, 2, 0]). (6,5)=3 (row 6, column 5=3). (6,5)=3's adjacent cells are (5,4)=?, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=2, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=1, (7,6)=?. So (6,5)=3 has five '?' adjacent cells. (6,5)=3 needs 3 mines there. Not helpful.\n\nRow 7, column 6=? (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]). (7,5)=1 (row 7, column 5=1). (7,5)=1's adjacent cells are (6,4)=2, (6,5)=3, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=0, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. So (7,5)=1 has two '?' adjacent cells: (6,6) and (7,6). So (7,5)=1 needs 1 mine here. So one of them is a mine.\n\nIf (7,6) is safe, then (6,6) is a mine. But we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is in a large area of '?'s but maybe has a low chance. For example, row 0, column 0 is '?'. Since the first move is usually safe, but we don't know if this is the first move. The game hasn't ended yet, so maybe it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, all 0s' adjacent cells are uncovered, so the next best is to pick a cell that is adjacent to a 1 with multiple '?'s, but the chance is higher.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 8, column 1: (8,1)=? (row 8: [?, ?, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]). (8,2)=1 (row 8, column 2=1). (8,2)=1's adjacent cells are (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=invalid, (9,2)=invalid, (9,3)=invalid. So (8,2)=1 has three '?' adjacent cells: (7,1), (7,2), (8,1). So 1 mine among three. So (8,1) has a 1\/3 chance of being a mine, which is relatively low. So uncovering (8,1) might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, row 7, column 1=? (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0]). (7,2)=? (row 7, column 2=?). (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3=1). (7,3)=1's adjacent cells are (6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=2, (7,2)=?, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0. So (7,3)=1 has two '?' adjacent cells: (6,2) and (7,2). So 1 mine among two. So (7,2) has 50% chance.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell in the top-left corner, like (0,0). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's check if there's a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nWait, let's look at row 5, column 8=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=2, (6,8)=0. All uncovered. So no help.\n\nAnother angle: the game ends at 100th epoch or uncovering a mine. The user wants to maximize the score, which is correct flags \/ 10. But the current action is to uncover, flag, or unflag. Since the user hasn't flagged any mines (Flags: 0\/36), maybe uncovering a safe cell is better.\n\nLet's think of a cell that is likely safe. For example, in row 0, column 0: '?'. The adjacent cell (0,1)=1, which has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (0,1) has adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2)=0, (1,0), (1,1)=1, (1,2)=1. (0,2)=0 is safe, so (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,0) or (1,0). So if I uncover (0,0), there's a 50% chance it's a mine. Not great.\n\nRow 1, column 0: '?'. Adjacent to (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?. (1,1)=1 has adjacent cells (0,0)=?, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=0, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?. So (1,1)=1 has multiple '?'s, so (1,0) has a lower chance.\n\nAlternatively, row 2, column 0: '?'. Adjacent to (1,0)=?, (1,1)=1, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. No info.\n\nRow 3, column 0: '?'. Same as above.\n\nRow 4, column 0: '?'. Adjacent to (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. No info.\n\nRow 5, column 0: '?'. Same.\n\nRow 6, column 0: '?'. Same.\n\nRow 7, column 0: '?'. Same.\n\nRow 8, column 0: '?'. Same.\n\nAll these corner cells are '?', but no info.\n\nLet's look at the right side. Row 0, column 8=0 (row 0: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). (0,8)=0, so adjacent cells (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 8=2 (row 1: [?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]). (1,8)=2's adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (0,8)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?. We determined earlier that (2,7) and (2,8) are mines, so (1,8)=2 is satisfied.\n\nRow 2, column 7=? and 8=?, which we think are mines.\n\nRow 3, column 8=2 (row 3: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2]). (3,8)=2's adjacent cells are (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,7)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0. So (3,8)=2 has two mines (2,7 and 2,8), which matches.\n\nRow 4, column 8=0.\n\nRow 5, column 8=0.\n\nRow 6, column 8=0.\n\nRow 7, column 8=0.\n\nRow 8, column 8=0.\n\nSo the right side has (2,7) and (2,8) as mines.\n\nLet's look at row 6, column 6=? (row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 2, 3, ?, 2, 0]). (6,7)=2 (row 6, column 7=2). (6,7)=2's adjacent cells are (5,6)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=?, (6,8)=0, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=0. So (6,7)=2 has three '?' adjacent cells: (5,6), (6,6), (7,6). We earlier thought (5,6) is a mine (from (4,7)=1). So (5,6) is a mine. Then (6,7)=2 needs 2 mines. So (6,6) or (7,6) must be a mine.\n\nIf (5,6) is a mine, then (4,6)=2 (row 4, column 6=2) has adjacent cells (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=2, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=?, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=1. So (4,6)=2 has two mines: (5,6) and one more (maybe (5,5)).\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is in a region with the most 0s, but all 0s are already processed. Alternatively, pick a cell that's adjacent to a 1 with the least number of '?'s.\n\nWait, let's look at row 2, column 5=0 (row 2, column 5=0). Its adjacent cells are (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nAnother idea: in Minesweeper, when a cell is uncovered and shows a number, it's the count of mines in adjacent cells. If a cell is '?', and all adjacent numbers have their mine counts already satisfied by flagged mines, then the '?' is safe. But since there are no flags yet (Flags: 0\/36), this doesn't apply.\n\nGiven that, maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that is in a corner, like (0,0). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's pick a cell that's adjacent to a 0, but all 0s' adjacent cells are uncovered. So maybe any '?' is as good as another. Let's pick (0,0).\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)"],"unflags":0,"seed":6,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to figure out the best first move for Minesweeper. The game is on a 9x9 grid with 10 mines. The current board is all unknown (?) cells. \n\nIn Minesweeper, the first move is usually safe because some versions guarantee that the first click doesn't hit a mine. Even if not, statistically, the corners or edges might have lower mine density, but since all cells are unknown, the best bet is to pick a cell that's in the middle to maximize the information gained when it's uncovered. \n\nCommon strategy is to start with a cell like (0,0) but maybe that's a corner. Alternatively, a central cell like (4,4) might be better. Wait, the grid is 9x9, so rows and columns go from 0 to 8. Let me confirm: 9x9, so coordinates (0-8, 0-8). The initial board shown has 12 rows? Wait, no, the user probably made a formatting error. The Current Board shows 13 lines of \"? ? ...\", but that's a mistake. The actual game is 9x9, so 9 rows. Maybe the user pasted it wrong. So ignoring that, focus on 9x9.\n\nThe first move, I should choose a cell that's likely to be safe. Since all are unknown, any cell is possible, but typically the first move is safe. Let's pick a central cell, like (4,4). That way, if it uncovers a number, it gives information about surrounding cells. Alternatively, (0,0) is a corner, but maybe less informative. Let's go with (4,4) as a balanced start.\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the current board has 12 rows? Wait, maybe that's a typo, but maybe the user just listed the rows as they are. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nThe input says the score is 0.0, flags are 0\/21 (but total mines are 10, so maybe that's a display error), and unflags 0. The current board has some cells uncovered with numbers, some as '?'. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in Minesweeper, a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. The '?' are unknown, 'F' is flagged. Right now, there are no flags, so all 'F's are 0.\n\nLooking at the board, let's list the rows with their coordinates. The first row is row 0, columns 0-11? Wait, the initial problem says the board is 9x9, so maybe the input's current board is a representation with some rows cut off or perhaps a formatting mistake. Maybe each row is 9 columns, but the way it's written here is split. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal problem states: \"The board is a 9x9 grid with 10 hidden mines\". So each row should have 9 cells. Let's parse the current board correctly. Let's count the number of elements per row. Let's take the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – that's 13 elements. That's probably a mistake in the input formatting. Maybe it's a typo, and the actual board is 9x9, so perhaps each row is 9 cells. Maybe the user pasted the board incorrectly, but I need to work with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is presented with each row being a line, and the columns are 0 to 8. Let's assume that each row has 9 cells, and the input's line breaks are just for display. For example, the first line might be row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?], the second line row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,?,?], etc. That makes more sense, as 9x9. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo row 0: columns 0-8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,?,?]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?] (wait, maybe the original input's lines are split, but let's not get stuck here. Let's focus on the visible cells with numbers, as those can help us find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers and their adjacent '?' cells. For example, a cell with 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if we find a 0, we can uncover all adjacent '?' cells because they are safe.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – assuming the first few cells are 0s. Let's take row 0, column 0: value 0. Its adjacent cells (row-1, col-1) is out of bounds, (row-1, col) out, (row-1, col+1) out, (row, col-1) out, (row, col+1) is (0,1) which is 0, (row+1, col-1) out, (row+1, col) is (1,0) which is 0, (row+1, col+1) is (1,1) which is 0. So all adjacent cells are already uncovered, so no help there.\n\nRow 0, column 5 is 0? Wait, the first row is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – let's index columns 0-8. So columns 0-5 are 0s, column 6 is 1, columns 7 and 8 are '?'. So row 0, columns 0-5 are 0. Let's take row 0, column 5 (value 0). Its adjacent cells: (0,4) is 0, (0,6) is 1, (1,4) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 2. So (0,5) is 0, which means all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. But (0,6) is 1, which contradicts that. Wait, no: the value in a cell is the count of mines in adjacent cells. So a 0 in (0,5) means that none of the 8 adjacent cells have mines. Let's check (0,5)'s adjacent cells:\n\nAdjacent cells to (0,5) are:\n(0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), and (since row 0 is top row, row-1 is invalid, so ( -1,4), (-1,5), (-1,6) are invalid). So valid adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). The cell (0,5) has value 0, so all these adjacent cells must be safe (no mines). But (0,6) has value 1, which is a number, meaning it's uncovered and safe (since numbers are safe cells). (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 2 – all are numbers, so they are safe. So (0,5) being 0 tells us nothing new, since those adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell that has adjacent '?' cells. For example, row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – let's assume row 4, column 3 is 0. Let's check row 4, column 3 (value 0). Its adjacent cells:\n\nRow 3, column 2: 1 (from row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\"), row 3, column 3: 0, row 3, column 4: 0, row 4, column 2: 1, row 4, column 4: 0, row 5, column 2: 1 (row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"), row 5, column 3: 0, row 5, column 4: 0.\n\nSo (4,3) is 0, which means all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's list the adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (3,2): 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(row-1, col) = (3,3): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (3,4): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(row, col-1) = (4,2): 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(row, col+1) = (4,4): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(row+1, col-1) = (5,2): 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(row+1, col) = (5,3): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (5,4): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n\nAll adjacent cells are already uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nLooking at row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" – let's take row 3, column 4: 0. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (2,3): 0 (row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"), (row-1, col) = (2,4): 0, (row-1, col+1) = (2,5): 1\n(row, col-1) = (3,3): 0, (row, col+1) = (3,5): 0\n(row+1, col-1) = (4,3): 0 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"), (row+1, col) = (4,4): 0, (row+1, col+1) = (4,5): 0\n\nAll these are uncovered (values 0 or 1), so no '?' here.\n\nLet's look for a cell with a number that has adjacent '?' cells where we can determine if they are safe or mines. For example, row 0, column 6 is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1) invalid, (row-1, col) invalid, (row-1, col+1) invalid (since row 0 is top)\n(row, col-1) = (0,5): 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (0,7): '?' (unknown)\n(row+1, col-1) = (1,5): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col) = (1,6): 2 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (1,7): '?' (unknown)\n\nSo (0,6) has value 1, meaning exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (0,7) and (1,7). The other adjacent cells (0,5), (1,5), (1,6) are uncovered (safe). So the 1 mine must be in either (0,7) or (1,7). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nRow 1, column 6 is 2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (0,5): 0 (safe)\n(row-1, col) = (0,6): 1 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (0,7): '?'\n(row, col-1) = (1,5): 1 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (1,7): '?'\n(row+1, col-1) = (2,5): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col) = (2,6): '?' (row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" so (2,6) is '?')\n(row+1, col+1) = (2,7): '?'\n\nSo (1,6) has value 2, meaning 2 mines in these 8 adjacent cells. The known safe cells are (0,5), (0,6), (1,5), (2,5). The unknown cells are (0,7), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7). So 2 mines among these four.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (1,4): 0 (row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" so (1,4) is 0)\n(row-1, col) = (1,5): 1 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (1,6): 2 (safe)\n(row, col-1) = (2,4): 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (2,6): '?'\n(row+1, col-1) = (3,4): 0 (row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" so (3,4) is 0)\n(row+1, col) = (3,5): 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (3,6): 1 (safe)\n\nSo (2,5) has value 1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cell here is (2,6). The other adjacent cells are safe (0,1,2, etc.). So (2,6) must be a mine! Because all other adjacent cells are safe (no mines), so the 1 mine must be in (2,6). That's a key insight.\n\nLet me verify: (2,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,4)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(1,5)=1 (safe, no mine)\n(1,6)=2 (safe, no mine)\n(2,4)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(2,6)=? (unknown)\n(3,4)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(3,5)=0 (safe, no mine)\n(3,6)=1 (safe, no mine)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (2,6) are safe (no mines). Since (2,5) has a value of 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Therefore, (2,6) must be the mine. So we should flag (2,6). But wait, the action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. Since we need to either flag mines or uncover safe cells.\n\nBut wait, let's confirm again. (2,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are 8 cells. Let's list all 8:\n\nTop-left: (1,4) → 0 (safe)\nTop: (1,5) → 1 (safe)\nTop-right: (1,6) → 2 (safe)\nLeft: (2,4) → 0 (safe)\nRight: (2,6) → ?\nBottom-left: (3,4) → 0 (safe)\nBottom: (3,5) → 0 (safe)\nBottom-right: (3,6) → 1 (safe)\n\nSo 7 of the 8 adjacent cells are safe (no mines). Therefore, the 8th cell (2,6) must be a mine. So we can flag (2,6). But let's check if there's any other possibility. Since all the other 7 are safe, the 1 mine in (2,5)'s adjacent must be (2,6). So flagging (2,6) would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the coordinates. Let's confirm the row and column numbers. The top-left is (0,0). So row 2, column 5 is (2,5). Its right neighbor is (2,6). Yes. So (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), and since (2,5) is 1, and all other adjacent cells are safe, (2,6) is a mine. So the action should be to flag (2,6). But wait, the current flags are 0\/21, which might be a display error (since total mines are 10). But regardless, flagging a confirmed mine is good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a 0 cell that has adjacent '?' cells. For example, row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – row 5, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (4,4): 0 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (4,4) is 0)\n(row-1, col) = (4,5): 0 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (4,6): 1 (safe)\n(row, col-1) = (5,4): 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (5,6): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col-1) = (6,4): 1 (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (6,4) is 1)\n(row+1, col) = (6,5): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (6,6): 1 (safe)\n\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – row 6, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all 0s (row 5, column 0 is 1, row 7, column 0 is 0, etc.), but maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, if a 0 cell has an adjacent '?', that '?' is safe and can be uncovered. Let's find such a cell.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 3: 0 (from row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\"). Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (2,2): 0 (row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (2,2) is 0)\n(row-1, col) = (2,3): 0 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (2,4): 0 (safe)\n(row, col-1) = (3,2): 1 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (3,4): 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col-1) = (4,2): 1 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (4,2) is 1)\n(row+1, col) = (4,3): 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (4,4): 0 (safe)\n\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 4, column 5: 0 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"). Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (3,4): 0 (safe)\n(row-1, col) = (3,5): 0 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (3,6): 1 (safe)\n(row, col-1) = (4,4): 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (4,6): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col-1) = (5,4): 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col) = (5,5): 0 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (5,6): 1 (safe)\n\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nHow about row 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – assuming row 7, column 4 is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (6,3): 0 (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (6,3) is 0)\n(row-1, col) = (6,4): 1 (safe)\n(row-1, col+1) = (6,5): 1 (safe)\n(row, col-1) = (7,3): 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (7,5): '?'\n(row+1, col-1) = (8,3): 0 (row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (8,3) is 0)\n(row+1, col) = (8,4): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (8,5): 1 (safe)\n\nSo (7,4) is 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (7,5). The other adjacent cells are safe. So (7,4) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (6,3)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=0, (7,5)=?, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. All the 1s here are numbers, meaning they are safe (since numbers are safe cells, not mines). So the mine must be in (7,5). So (7,5) is a mine. So we can flag (7,5).\n\nWait, let's confirm: (7,4) is 1. The adjacent cells that are mines are 1. The cells with numbers (1, 2, etc.) are safe, so they don't count as mines. So the adjacent cells to (7,4) are:\n\n- (6,3): 0 (safe)\n- (6,4): 1 (safe)\n- (6,5): 1 (safe)\n- (7,3): 0 (safe)\n- (7,5): ? (unknown)\n- (8,3): 0 (safe)\n- (8,4): 1 (safe)\n- (8,5): 1 (safe)\n\nSo among these, the only unknown is (7,5). Since (7,4) is 1, there must be 1 mine in these 8 cells. All the others are safe, so (7,5) must be a mine. So flag (7,5).\n\nBut earlier, we had (2,6) as a mine. Let's check if these are correct.\n\nAnother cell: row 8, column 6 is 2 (row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"). Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (7,5): '?' (from row 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (7,5) is '?')\n(row-1, col) = (7,6): '?'\n(row-1, col+1) = (7,7): '?'\n(row, col-1) = (8,5): 1 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (8,7): '?'\n(row+1, col-1) = (9,5): 0 (row 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,5) is 0)\n(row+1, col) = (9,6): 1 (safe)\n(row+1, col+1) = (9,7): '?'\n\nBut row 9 may be beyond the 9x9 grid (since rows are 0-8). So maybe the input has more rows than 9, which is a mistake. Let's focus on rows 0-8 (9 rows).\n\nAssuming the grid is 9x9 (rows 0-8, columns 0-8), let's re-express the current board correctly. Let's take each row as 9 columns:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?]\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,?,?]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?,?]  (original row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → first 9 columns: 0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?,?)\nRow 3: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,2,?]  (row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → first 9 columns)\nRow 4: [?,?,1,0,0,0,1,?,?]  (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\")\nRow 5: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,?,?,?]  (row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\")\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,?,?,?]  (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\")\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,?,?,?,?,?]  (row 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → first 9 columns)\nRow 8: [1,1,0,0,1,1,2,?,?,?]  (row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\")\n\nNow, let's re-analyze (2,5) which is row 2, column 5. Its value is 1. Adjacent cells (all within 0-8 rows and columns):\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (1,4) → 0 (row 1, column 4)\n(row-1, col) = (1,5) → 1 (row 1, column 5)\n(row-1, col+1) = (1,6) → 2 (row 1, column 6)\n(row, col-1) = (2,4) → 0 (row 2, column 4)\n(row, col+1) = (2,6) → ? (row 2, column 6)\n(row+1, col-1) = (3,4) → 0 (row 3, column 4)\n(row+1, col) = (3,5) → 0 (row 3, column 5)\n(row+1, col+1) = (3,6) → 1 (row 3, column 6)\n\nSo (2,5) has 1 mine in these 8 cells. The cells (1,4)=0 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=2 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe), (3,6)=1 (safe). All these are safe (no mines), so the only remaining adjacent cell is (2,6). Therefore, (2,6) must be a mine. So we should flag (2,6).\n\nAnother cell: row 3, column 6 is 1 (row 3, column 6: 1). Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (2,5) → 1 (safe)\n(row-1, col) = (2,6) → ? (mine, as per above)\n(row-1, col+1) = (2,7) → ?\n(row, col-1) = (3,5) → 0 (safe)\n(row, col+1) = (3,7) → ?\n(row+1, col-1) = (4,5) → 0 (row 4, column 5)\n(row+1, col) = (4,6) → 1 (row 4, column 6)\n(row+1, col+1) = (4,7) → ?\n\nSo (3,6) has value 1. We know (2,6) is a mine (from previous analysis). So that's 1 mine already. The other adjacent cells are (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). Since (3,6) is 1, there's exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Since (2,6) is a mine, the others must be safe. So (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) are safe. Therefore, we can uncover (2,7), (3,7), or (4,7).\n\nFor example, (2,7) is adjacent to (3,6)=1 and (2,6)=mine. Since (3,6) has only 1 mine (which is (2,6)), (2,7) must be safe. So uncovering (2,7) is safe.\n\nLet's confirm: (3,6)=1. Its adjacent cells include (2,6) which is a mine (counts as 1). So the other adjacent cells must have 0 mines. Therefore, (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) are safe. So uncovering (2,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, (3,7) is also safe. Let's pick one. Let's say (2,7). So the action would be to uncover (2,7).\n\nBut wait, let's make sure. (3,6) has value 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5)=1 (safe)\n(2,6)=mine (1 mine)\n(2,7)=?\n(3,5)=0 (safe)\n(3,7)=?\n(4,5)=0 (safe)\n(4,6)=1 (safe)\n(4,7)=?\n\nTotal mines in adjacent cells: 1 (from (2,6)). So the other cells (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) must be safe. So uncovering any of them is safe.\n\nWhich one to choose? Maybe the one with the most potential to reveal more 0s. Let's pick (2,7). So the action is 'uncover (2,7)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,7)","uncover (2,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows 13 rows, which might be a typo or maybe it's a larger grid? Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the input here is a mistake, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10. Right now, flags are 0\/21, which might be a typo (since there are 10 mines, maybe 0\/10), but let's focus on the board.\n\nLooking at the current board, each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's index the rows from 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Let's list the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? → Wait, that's 13 columns, which is more than 9. Maybe it's a formatting error. The problem statement says 9x9, so perhaps each row has 9 cells. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board, but perhaps each row is 9 cells. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells, so maybe the input is split into lines with some truncation. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are the cells, and the ? are unknown. Let's try to parse the board correctly.\n\nWait, the input format for the current board shows each row as a list of cells. Let's count the columns. For example, row 0 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which is 13 elements. That's probably a mistake. But given that the Minesweeper is 9x9, maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the input here is a misrepresentation. Alternatively, maybe the user intended a different grid size, but according to the problem statement, it's 9x9. So perhaps the current board is a 9x9 grid, and the way it's displayed here is a formatting error. Let's proceed with the assumption that each row has 9 cells, and the extra ? are typos.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are numbered 0-12, making it a 13x9 grid, but that contradicts the problem statement. Hmm. This is confusing, but perhaps the key is to look for cells that can be safely uncovered.\n\nIn Minesweeper, a cell with a number indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. If a cell is uncovered and shows 0, all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. Let's look for 0 cells and their adjacent ? cells.\n\nFor example, let's take row 0, columns 0-5 are all 0s. So (0,0) to (0,5) are 0. The adjacent cells to these 0s would be safe. Let's check (0,6) which is 1. The cell (0,6) is 1, so it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,6) would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, so no mine. (1,5) is 1 (from row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ...\"), so (1,5) is 1. (1,6) is 2. So (0,6) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The cell (0,7) is ?, which is adjacent to (0,6). If (0,6) is 1, and some of its adjacent cells might be mines.\n\nBut maybe better to look for cells that are 0, because their adjacent cells are safe. Let's find 0 cells and see their adjacent ? cells.\n\nLooking at row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → assuming 9 columns, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are 0. So these cells are 0, meaning all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (3,3). (3,3) is 0, so adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Let's see the current state of these cells:\n\n(2,2): row 2 is \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ...\" → (2,2) is 0.\n\n(2,3): 0.\n\n(2,4): 0.\n\n(3,2): 1 (row 3: \"1 1 1 0 ...\" → (3,2) is 1).\n\n(3,4): 0 (given).\n\n(4,2): row 4 is \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ...\" → (4,2) is 1.\n\n(4,3): 0.\n\n(4,4): 0.\n\nAll these are uncovered, so maybe (3,3) being 0 doesn't have any ? adjacent. What about (3,4) which is 0. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 0, (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 1 (row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\"), (3,3) is 0, (3,5) is 0, (4,3) is 0, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 0 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ...\"). So (3,4) being 0, adjacent cell (2,5) is 1, which is already uncovered. (3,5) is 0, which is uncovered. So maybe no ? adjacent here.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ...\" → (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are 0. Let's check (5,5) which is 0. Its adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 0, (4,6) is 1 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ...\"), (5,4) is 0, (5,6) is 1 (row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\"), (6,4) is 1 (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ...\"), (6,5) is 1, (6,6) is 1. So (5,5) is 0, adjacent cells are all uncovered except maybe (4,6) which is 1 (already uncovered). So no ? here.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ...\" → (6,0)-(6,3) are 0. Let's take (6,3) which is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,2) is 1 (row 5: \"1 1 1 0 ...\"), (5,3) is 0, (5,4) is 0, (6,2) is 0, (6,4) is 1, (7,2) is 0 (row 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ...\"), (7,3) is 0, (7,4) is 1. All these are uncovered. So no ? here.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ...\" → (7,0)-(7,3) are 0. Let's check (7,3) which is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2) is 0, (6,3) is 0, (6,4) is 1, (7,2) is 0, (7,4) is 1, (8,2) is 0 (row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ...\"), (8,3) is 0, (8,4) is 1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ...\" → (8,2), (8,3) are 0. Let's take (8,3) which is 0. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Wait, row 9 is \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ...\", so (9,2) is 0, (9,3) is 0, (9,4) is 0. (7,2) is 0, (7,3) is 0, (7,4) is 1, (8,2) is 0, (8,4) is 1. So (8,3) is 0, adjacent cells (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) are 0, which are already uncovered (since row 9's (9,2) is 0, (9,3) is 0, (9,4) is 0). So no ? here.\n\nRow 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ...\" → (9,2)-(9,5) are 0. (9,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). (8,4) is 1, (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 2 (row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ...\"), (9,4) is 0, (9,6) is 1 (row 9: \"... 0 0 1 ...\"), (10,4) is 1 (row 10: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\"), (10,5) is 0, (10,6) is 0. All these are uncovered.\n\nRow 10: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (10,5), (10,6) are 0. (10,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (10,4), (10,6), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). (9,4) is 0, (9,5) is 0, (9,6) is 1, (10,4) is 1, (10,6) is 0, (11,4) is 1 (row 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\"), (11,5) is 0, (11,6) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (11,5), (11,6) are 0. (11,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (11,4), (11,6), (12,4), (12,5), (12,6). (10,4) is 1, (10,5) is 0, (10,6) is 0, (11,4) is 1, (11,6) is 0, (12,4) is 1 (row 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\"), (12,5) is 0, (12,6) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (12,5), (12,6) are 0. Their adjacent cells are similar to row 11, probably all uncovered.\n\nNow, looking for cells that are 0 and have adjacent ? cells. Let's check row 0, column 6 is 1. The cell (0,6) is 1, so adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2, (1,7)=?. So (0,7) and (1,7) are ?. Since (0,6) is 1, it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (1,6)=2, which is a number, so not a mine. (1,5)=1 is a number, not a mine. (0,5)=0, not a mine. So the mine must be in either (0,7) or (1,7). But (1,6)=2: let's check (1,6)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=?, (2,7)=2. So (1,6) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The known safe cells are (0,5), (0,6), (1,5), (2,5). So possible mines are (0,7), (1,7), (2,6), (2,7). But (2,7)=2 (from row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ...\"), so (2,7) is 2, not a mine. So (1,6)=2 has 2 mines in (0,7), (1,7), (2,6). \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 0, it's safe. Let's find any 0 cells and see if their adjacent cells are ?.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ...\" → (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are 0. The adjacent cells to (4,3) would be (3,2)=1, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All uncovered. (4,4) is 0, adjacent cells are (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered. (4,5) is 0, adjacent cells are (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All uncovered. So no ? here.\n\nRow 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ...\" → (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are 0. Adjacent cells all uncovered as before.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ...\" → (6,0)-(6,3) are 0. Their adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ...\" → (7,0)-(7,3) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ...\" → (8,2), (8,3) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ...\" → (9,2)-(9,5) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 10: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (10,5), (10,6) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (11,5), (11,6) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (12,5), (12,6) are 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nSo where are the ? cells? Let's list all ? positions. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 0: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → but assuming 9 columns, maybe row 0 has columns 0-8, so (0,7), (0,8) are ?.\n\nRow 1: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → (1,7), (1,8) are ?.\n\nRow 2: columns 6,8,9,10,11,12 → (2,6), (2,8) are ?.\n\nRow 3: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → (3,7), (3,8) are ?.\n\nRow 4: columns 0,1,7,8,9,10,11,12 → (4,0), (4,1), (4,7), (4,8) are ?.\n\nRow 5: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → (5,7), (5,8) are ?.\n\nRow 6: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → (6,7), (6,8) are ?.\n\nRow 7: columns 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 → (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) are ?.\n\nRow 8: columns 7,8,9,10,11,12 → (8,7), (8,8) are ?.\n\nRow 9: columns 0,7,8,9,10,11,12 → (9,0), (9,7), (9,8) are ?.\n\nRow 10: columns 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12 → (10,0), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,8) are ?.\n\nRow 11: columns 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12 → (11,0), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3), (11,8) are ?.\n\nRow 12: columns 0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12 → (12,0), (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (12,8) are ?.\n\nThis is a lot of ?. Since the game is 9x9, maybe the rows are 0-8, and the columns 0-8. Let's focus on 9x9. Let's list the 9x9 cells:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?] → (0,7), (0,8) are ?\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,1,2,?,?] → (1,7), (1,8) are ?\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,1,?,2,?] → (2,6), (2,8) are ? (since (2,7) is 2)\n\nRow 3: [1,1,1,0,0,1,2,?,?] → (3,7), (3,8) are ?\n\nRow 4: [?, ?,1,0,0,0,1,?,?] → (4,0), (4,1), (4,7), (4,8) are ?\n\nRow 5: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,?,?] → (5,7), (5,8) are ?\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,?,?] → (6,7), (6,8) are ?\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,1,?, ?, ?, ?] → (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) are ? (since row 7 is \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → 9 columns: (7,0)-(7,4) are 0,1; (7,5)-(7,8) are ?)\n\nRow 8: [1,1,0,0,1,1,2,?,?] → (8,7), (8,8) are ?\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that can help determine safe cells. For example, take row 2, column 6: (2,6) is ?. Let's check the adjacent cells of (2,5)=1 (row 2, column 5 is 1). (2,5) has adjacent cells: (1,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=?, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. So (2,5) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The known cells: (1,4)=0 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=2 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe). So the only unknown adjacent cell is (2,6)=?, which must be the mine. So (2,6) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,6).\n\nWait, let's verify: (2,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells are 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(1,4) → row 1, column 4: 0 (safe)\n\n(1,5) → row 1, column 5: 1 (safe)\n\n(1,6) → row 1, column 6: 2 (safe)\n\n(2,4) → row 2, column 4: 0 (safe)\n\n(2,6) → row 2, column 6: ? (unknown)\n\n(3,4) → row 3, column 4: 0 (safe)\n\n(3,5) → row 3, column 5: 1 (safe)\n\n(3,6) → row 3, column 6: 2 (safe)\n\nSo of the 8 adjacent cells to (2,5)=1, 7 are safe (0,1,2), so the 8th (2,6) must be a mine. Therefore, (2,6) is a mine. So we should flag (2,6).\n\nAnother example: row 1, column 6 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (1,6)=2 has adjacent cells:\n\n(0,5)=0 (safe)\n\n(0,6)=1 (safe)\n\n(0,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(1,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(1,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(2,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(2,6)=? (unknown, which we just determined is a mine)\n\n(2,7)=2 (safe)\n\nSo (1,6)=2 has 3 unknown cells: (0,7), (1,7), (2,6). We know (2,6) is a mine, so that's 1 mine. Since (1,6)=2, there must be 2 mines in total. So one more mine in (0,7) or (1,7).\n\nBut let's confirm (2,6) is a mine. If (2,6) is a mine, then (2,7)=2 (row 2, column 7 is 2). Let's check (2,7)=2's adjacent cells:\n\n(1,6)=2 (safe)\n\n(1,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(1,8)=? (unknown)\n\n(2,6)=mine (flagged)\n\n(2,8)=? (unknown)\n\n(3,6)=2 (safe)\n\n(3,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(3,8)=? (unknown)\n\nSo (2,7)=2 has adjacent cells: (1,6)=2 (safe), (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=mine, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2 (safe), (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. The mine at (2,6) is one, so there should be 1 more mine in the remaining 7 cells. But this might not help immediately.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to (2,5)=1. Since all adjacent cells except (2,6) are safe, (2,6) must be a mine. So the action should be to flag (2,6). But wait, the user can flag or uncover. Since we need to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells, and uncovering a mine ends the game, we should avoid uncovering mines. So if we can identify a mine, flagging it is good.\n\nBut wait, let's check another cell. Row 3, column 6 is 2 (row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ...\"). (3,6)=2's adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(2,6)=? (unknown, which we think is a mine)\n\n(2,7)=2 (safe)\n\n(3,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(3,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(4,5)=0 (safe)\n\n(4,6)=1 (safe)\n\n(4,7)=? (unknown)\n\nSo (3,6)=2 has adjacent cells: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=?, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. If (2,6) is a mine, that's 1 mine. Then (3,6)=2 needs one more mine in (3,7) or (4,7).\n\nBut let's confirm (2,6) is a mine. Let's take row 4, column 6=1 (row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ...\"). (4,6)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(3,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(3,6)=2 (safe)\n\n(3,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(4,5)=0 (safe)\n\n(4,7)=? (unknown)\n\n(5,5)=0 (safe)\n\n(5,6)=1 (safe)\n\n(5,7)=? (unknown)\n\nSo (4,6)=1 has 3 unknown cells: (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). It needs 1 mine among them.\n\nIf (2,6) is a mine, then (1,6)=2 (row 1, column 6) has 1 mine (at (2,6)) and needs 1 more in (0,7) or (1,7).\n\nBut let's get back to the initial safe move. Since (2,5)=1 has all adjacent cells safe except (2,6), (2,6) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,6). So the action is 'flag (2,6)'.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. (2,5) is in row 2, column 5. Its coordinates are (2,5). The adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (1,4) → 0\n\n(row-1, col) = (1,5) → 1\n\n(row-1, col+1) = (1,6) → 2\n\n(row, col-1) = (2,4) → 0\n\n(row, col+1) = (2,6) → ?\n\n(row+1, col-1) = (3,4) → 0\n\n(row+1, col) = (3,5) → 1\n\n(row+1, col+1) = (3,6) → 2\n\nAll these cells except (2,6) are uncovered and are numbers (0,1,2), which are safe (not mines). Therefore, the only possible mine adjacent to (2,5) is (2,6). Since (2,5) is 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Therefore, (2,6) is a mine. So we should flag (2,6).\n\nAnswer: flag (2,6)","flag (2,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the game rules. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows more rows and columns—maybe it's a typo, but I'll focus on the given data. The score is 0.0476, which is 1\/21, so they have 1 correct flag out of 21 flagged? Wait, no, the \"Flags: 1\/21\" probably means they've placed 21 flags, but only 1 is correct (since total mines are 10). The goal is to flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Each row is a line of characters separated by spaces. Let's index rows from 0 to, say, 13 (since there are 13 rows listed), and columns 0 to 12 (each row has 13 elements). Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the current board display is a mistake, but perhaps it's a 13x13 grid? Or maybe the user input is correct. Let's assume the rows and columns are as displayed.\n\nThe board has cells that are numbers (indicating adjacent mines), '?', or 'F' (flagged). The task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell.\n\nFirst, let's look for safe cells to uncover. A safe cell is one that's '?' and not flagged, and adjacent to a number that has all its adjacent mines already accounted for. For example, if a cell with number '1' has one adjacent 'F' (flagged as mine), then the other adjacent '?' are safe.\n\nLet's take a row from the current board. Let's look at row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". The cell at (2,6) is 'F' (flagged). The cell to its left is (2,5) which is '1'. The '1' at (2,5) has adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,5). The coordinates around (row, col) are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), excluding out of bounds.\n\n(2,5) is row 2, column 5. Adjacent cells are:\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n(2,4),        (2,6),\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\nFrom the current board:\nRow 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (1,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2\nRow 2: (2,4)=0, (2,6)=F\nRow 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2\n\nSo the adjacent cells to (2,5) are:\n(1,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2,\n(2,4)=0, (2,6)=F,\n(3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2\n\nThe number at (2,5) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine in these 8 adjacent cells. The cell (2,6) is flagged (F), so if that's a correct flag, then the other adjacent cells have 0 mines. Therefore, all the other adjacent '?' cells to (2,5) can be uncovered safely. Wait, but (2,5) is 1, and if (2,6) is a mine (flagged correctly), then the 1 is accounted for, so all other adjacent cells (which are numbers, not '?') are safe. So maybe (2,5) doesn't help.\n\nLet's look at row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". The cell (3,5) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,5) is row 3, column 5. Adjacent cells:\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\n(3,4),        (3,6),\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 2: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=F\nRow 3: (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2\nRow 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1\n\nSo the adjacent cells are 0,1,F,0,2,0,0,1. The number at (3,5) is 1. The flagged cell (2,6) is adjacent. If (2,6) is a mine, then the 1 is satisfied, so the other adjacent cells (which are 0,1,0,2,0,0,1) are safe. But (3,6) is 2. Let's check (3,6)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(3,6) is row 3, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5),        (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 2: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?\nRow 3: (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?\nRow 4: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?\n\nSo the adjacent cells are 1, F, ?, 1, ?, 0, 1, ?. The number is 2, so there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. Currently, there's 1 flagged cell (F) at (2,6). If that's a mine, then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent '?' cells. The '?' cells here are (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). So maybe not helpful yet.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". The cell (5,6) is 1. Adjacent cells:\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7),\n(5,5),        (5,7),\n(6,5), (6,6), (6,7)\n\nRow 4: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?\nRow 5: (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?\n\nSo the adjacent cells are 0,1,?,0,?,1,1,?. The number is 1, so there's 1 mine in these 8. The '?' cells here are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). If none of the non-'?' cells are mines (since they are numbers, which are safe once uncovered), then the mine must be in one of the '?'. But not sure.\n\nLooking for cells with 0. A cell with 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So if there's a 0, all adjacent '?' can be uncovered. Let's check row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s in row 0, columns 0-5. For example, (0,5) is 0. Adjacent cells to (0,5) would be (0-1 is invalid, so rows 0 and 1), columns 4-6. So (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). From row 0: (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1. Row 1: (1,4)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2. All these are uncovered, so the 0 at (0,5) is correct. The 0s in row 0, columns 0-4: for example, (0,0)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). From row 0: (0,1)=0. Row 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. All uncovered and safe. So these 0s don't have adjacent '?' cells that are '?', since the '?' starts at column 6 in row 0.\n\nRow 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s here are columns 0-4. For example, (1,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From row 0: (0,3)=0, (0,4)=0, (0,5)=0. Row 1: (1,3)=0, (1,5)=1. Row 2: (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1. All these are uncovered, so (1,4)=0 is correct. The '?' starts at column 7 in row 1.\n\nRow 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s here are columns 0-4. Their adjacent cells are all uncovered and safe, so no '?' to uncover there.\n\nRow 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s are at (3,3) and (3,4). Let's check (3,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). From row 2: (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1. Row 3: (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1. Row 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. So all adjacent cells are uncovered (since row 4, columns 3-5 are 0,0,0). So (3,4)=0 is correct, and no '?' adjacent here.\n\nRow 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s are at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's take (4,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). From row 3: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. Row 4: (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1. Row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All these are uncovered, so (4,5)=0 is correct. The '?' in row 4 are at columns 0,1,7-12.\n\nRow 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (5,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). From row 4: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. Row 5: (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1. Row 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1. All uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (6,0)-(6,3). (6,3)=0. Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). From row 5: (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. Row 6: (6,2)=0, (6,4)=1. Row 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (7,2)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=1. All uncovered, so (6,3)=0 is correct. '?' starts at column 7.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (7,0)-(7,3). (7,3)=0. Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). From row 6: (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=1. Row 7: (7,2)=0, (7,4)=1. Row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (8,2)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=1. All uncovered, so (7,3)=0 is correct. '?' starts at column 5.\n\nRow 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (8,2), (8,3). (8,3)=0. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). From row 7: (7,2)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=1. Row 8: (8,2)=0, (8,4)=1. Row 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,2)=0, (9,3)=0, (9,4)=0. All uncovered, so (8,3)=0 is correct. '?' in row 8 start at column 7.\n\nRow 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (9,2)-(9,5). (9,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). From row 8: (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=2. Row 9: (9,4)=0, (9,6)=1. Row 10: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (10,4)=1, (10,5)=0, (10,6)=1. All uncovered, so (9,5)=0 is correct. '?' in row 9 are at 0,7-12.\n\nRow 10: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0 at (10,5). Adjacent cells: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (10,4), (10,6), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). From row 9: (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=1. Row 10: (10,4)=1, (10,6)=1. Row 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0, (11,6)=0. All uncovered, so (10,5)=0 is correct. '?' in row 10 are at 0,8-12.\n\nRow 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (11,5), (11,6). (11,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (11,4), (11,6), (12,4), (12,5), (12,6). From row 10: (10,4)=1, (10,5)=0, (10,6)=1. Row 11: (11,4)=1, (11,6)=0. Row 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (12,4)=1, (12,5)=0, (12,6)=0. All uncovered, so (11,5)=0 is correct. '?' in row 11 are at 0-3,8-12.\n\nRow 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". 0s at (12,5), (12,6). (12,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (11,4), (11,5), (11,6), (12,4), (12,6), (13,4), (13,5), (13,6) – but assuming 13 is the last row, maybe. From row 11: (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0, (11,6)=0. Row 12: (12,4)=1, (12,6)=0. If there's a row 13, but it's not listed. Anyway, these 0s are surrounded by uncovered cells.\n\nNow, looking for '0' cells that have adjacent '?' cells. For example, let's check row 4, column 3: (4,3)=0. Adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). From row 3: (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0. Row 4: (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0. Row 5: (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All these are uncovered, so no '?' adjacent.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are '?' and adjacent to a number where the number of adjacent 'F's plus the number of adjacent '?' equals the number. For example, if a cell has number 2, and there are 2 'F's adjacent, then the rest are safe. Or if a cell has number 1 and there's 1 '?' adjacent, then that '?' must be a mine (so flag it), or if the number is 1 and there's 1 'F' adjacent, then the other '?' are safe.\n\nLet's take row 2, column 6: (2,6)=F (flagged). The cell to its right is (2,7)=? and (2,8)=?, etc. The cell (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2, (1,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?.\n\nThe cell (1,6)=2 (row 1, column 6). Let's list its adjacent cells. (1,6) is row 1, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n(0,5), (0,6), (0,7),\n(1,5),        (1,7),\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 0: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?\nRow 1: (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?\nRow 2: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?\n\nSo the adjacent cells are 0,1,?,1,?,1,F,?. The number at (1,6) is 2. So there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. Currently, there's 1 flagged cell (F) at (2,6). If that's a mine, then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent '?' cells: (0,7), (1,7), (2,7). So (1,6)=2 has 1 F and 3 '?'. So 1 mine in those 3 '?'.\n\nNow, cell (3,6)=2 (row 3, column 6). Adjacent cells:\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5),        (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 2: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?\nRow 3: (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?\nRow 4: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?\n\nSo adjacent cells: 1, F, ?, 1, ?, 0, 1, ?. Number is 2, so 2 mines. 1 F, so 1 more mine in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). Same as (1,6)=2's adjacent '?'.\n\nNow, cell (0,6)=1 (row 0, column 6). Adjacent cells:\n(0-1 invalid, so rows 0 and 1), columns 5-7.\n(0,5), (0,6), (0,7),\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 0: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?\nRow 1: (1,5)=1, (1,6)=2, (1,7)=?\n\nSo adjacent cells: 0,1,?,1,2,?. The number at (0,6)=1 means 1 mine in these 6 cells (since it's on the top edge, only 6 adjacent cells). The cells here are (0,7) and (1,7) as '?', and the rest are numbers (safe). So the mine must be in either (0,7) or (1,7). Since (0,6)=1 has 1 mine, and (1,6)=2 has 2 mines (one of which is (2,6)=F), then (0,7) and (1,7) could be part of that.\n\nAnother cell: row 8, column 6=2 (row 8, column 6). Let's check its adjacent cells. (8,6) is row 8, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n(7,5), (7,6), (7,7),\n(8,5),        (8,7),\n(9,5), (9,6), (9,7)\n\nFrom the board:\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (7,5)=?, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?\nRow 8: (8,5)=1, (8,7)=?\nRow 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,5)=0, (9,6)=1, (9,7)=?\n\nSo the adjacent cells are ?, ?, ?, 1, ?, 0, 1, ?. The number is 2, so 2 mines here. Not sure yet.\n\nLet's look for a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so if a 0 has an adjacent '?', that '?' can be uncovered. For example, let's check row 9, column 5=0 (row 9, column 5). Its adjacent cells include (9,4)=0, (9,6)=1, (10,5)=0, etc. Are there any '?' adjacent to 0s? Let's check row 4, column 5=0 (row 4, column 5). Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,5)=0. No '?' there.\n\nRow 5, column 5=0 (row 5, column 5). Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (4,5)=0, (6,5)=1. No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 10, column 5=0 (row 10, column 5). Adjacent cells: (10,4)=1, (10,6)=1, (9,5)=0, (11,5)=0. No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 11, column 5=0 (row 11, column 5). Adjacent cells: (11,4)=1, (11,6)=0, (10,5)=0, (12,5)=0. No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 12, column 5=0 (row 12, column 5). Adjacent cells: (12,4)=1, (12,6)=0, (11,5)=0, (13,5)=? (if row 13 exists). But row 12's cells are \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\", so (12,5)=0, (12,6)=0. Adjacent cells to (12,5) include (12,4)=1, (12,6)=0, (11,5)=0, (13,5)=? (if row 13 is there). But since the board is 9x9, maybe the rows listed are a mistake, but perhaps it's a larger board. Maybe I should focus on the initial 9x9, but the given board has 13 rows. Maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the earliest '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 6 is 1, and the next cells are '?'. But row 0, column 6 is 1, not 0. The first '?' in row 0 is column 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (0,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (1,6)=2, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 4: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,7)=?, etc.\n\nRow 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (5,7)=?, etc.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (6,7)=?, etc.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (7,5)=?, (7,6)=?, etc.\n\nRow 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (8,7)=?, etc.\n\nRow 9: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,0)=?, (9,7)=?, etc.\n\nRow 10: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (10,0)=?, (10,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 11: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (11,0)=?, (11,1)=?, (11,2)=?, (11,3)=?, (11,8)=?, etc.\n\nRow 12: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (12,0)=?, (12,1)=?, (12,2)=?, (12,3)=?, (12,8)=?, etc.\n\nNow, let's consider that uncovering a cell with 0 will automatically uncover all adjacent cells, which is efficient. So if there's a '?' adjacent to a 0, that's a safe move. Let's check row 4, column 3=0 (row 4, column 3). Its adjacent cells include (4,2)=1 (which is a number), (5,3)=0 (number), (3,3)=1 (number), so no '?' there.\n\nRow 7, column 3=0 (row 7, column 3). Adjacent cells: (7,2)=0 (number), (7,4)=1 (number), (6,3)=0 (number), (8,3)=0 (number). No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 8, column 2=0 (row 8, column 2). Adjacent cells: (8,1)=1 (number), (8,3)=0 (number), (7,2)=0 (number), (9,2)=0 (number). No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 9, column 2=0 (row 9, column 2). Adjacent cells: (9,1)=1 (number), (9,3)=0 (number), (8,2)=0 (number), (10,2)=1 (number). No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 10, column 2=1 (row 10, column 2). Not 0.\n\nRow 11, column 5=0 (row 11, column 5). Adjacent cells: (11,4)=1 (number), (11,6)=0 (number), (10,5)=0 (number), (12,5)=0 (number). No '?' adjacent.\n\nRow 12, column 5=0 (row 12, column 5). Adjacent cells: (12,4)=1 (number), (12,6)=0 (number), (11,5)=0 (number), (13,5)=? (if exists). But since we don't know row 13, maybe not.\n\nNow, maybe look for a '?' that is in a corner or edge, but not sure. Alternatively, since the score is low (only 1 correct flag), maybe the flagged cell at (2,6) is incorrect. Let's check if (2,6) is a mine. The cell (2,5)=1, which has adjacent cells. If (2,6) is a mine, then (2,5)=1 is satisfied. The cell (2,6) is also adjacent to (1,6)=2. (1,6)=2 has two adjacent mines. If (2,6) is one, then there's another mine adjacent to (1,6). The adjacent cells to (1,6) are (0,5)=0 (safe), (0,6)=1 (safe), (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,7)=?, (2,5)=1 (safe), (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?. So two mines: (2,6) and one of (0,7), (1,7), (2,7).\n\nThe cell (3,6)=2 has adjacent cells (2,5)=1 (safe), (2,6)=F, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0 (safe), (4,6)=1 (safe), (4,7)=?. So two mines: (2,6) and one of (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nIf (2,6) is a mine, then (1,6)=2 and (3,6)=2 each need one more mine. The overlapping '?' between (1,6) and (3,6) is (2,7). So (2,7) could be the second mine for both. Then (1,6)=2 would have (2,6) and (2,7), and (3,6)=2 would have (2,6) and (2,7). That works. So (2,7) might be a mine. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,6) is not a mine (incorrect flag), then (2,5)=1 needs a mine in its adjacent cells. (2,5)'s adjacent cells are (1,4)=0 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=2 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (2,6)=F (incorrect), (3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe). So all adjacent cells are safe, which would mean (2,5)=1 is incorrect, which can't be. So (2,6) must be a mine (correct flag), since (2,5)=1 has no other adjacent cells that could be mines. Therefore, the flag at (2,6) is correct (which matches the score of 1\/10, but the current score is 1\/21, so maybe there are 21 flags, 1 correct).\n\nSo, since (2,6) is a correct flag, let's look for other safe cells. The cell (0,5)=0 (row 0, column 5). Its adjacent cells are all safe, so the '?' cells in row 0, column 7-12 are not adjacent to 0, but maybe row 0, column 6=1. Let's check (0,6)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=0 (safe), (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=2 (safe), (1,7)=?. So (0,6)=1 has two adjacent '?' cells: (0,7) and (1,7). Since (0,6)=1, exactly one of these two is a mine.\n\nIf we uncover (0,7), if it's a number, then we know (1,7) is a mine (since 1 mine total), or if (0,7) is a mine, then we lose. But since the game ends if we uncover a mine, we need to avoid that. Alternatively, look for a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nAnother approach: look for a '?' that is adjacent to multiple 0s. For example, row 4, column 0=? (row 4, column 0). What's adjacent to it? (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). Row 3: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1. Row 4: (4,1)=?. Row 5: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (5,0)=1, (5,1)=1. So adjacent cells are 1,1,?,1,1. Not helpful.\n\nRow 7, column 5=? (row 7, column 5). Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=2. So (7,5) is adjacent to several 1s and 2s. Not sure.\n\nRow 9, column 0=? (row 9, column 0). Adjacent cells: (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1, (9,1)=1, (10,0)=?. Row 8: \"1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (8,0)=1, (8,1)=1. Row 9: (9,1)=1. Row 10: \"? 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (10,0)=?. So adjacent cells are 1,1,1,?. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, let's check row 3, column 4=0 (row 3, column 4). Adjacent cells: (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. All are numbers, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 4, column 4=0 (row 4, column 4). Adjacent cells: (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 5, column 4=0 (row 5, column 4). Adjacent cells: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 6, column 3=0 (row 6, column 3). Adjacent cells: (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=1. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 7, column 3=0 (row 7, column 3). Adjacent cells: (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=1. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 8, column 3=0 (row 8, column 3). Adjacent cells: (7,2)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=0, (9,4)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 9, column 3=0 (row 9, column 3). Adjacent cells: (8,2)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=1, (10,4)=1. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 10, column 4=1 (row 10, column 4). Not 0.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's no 0-adjacent '?' cells, so we need to look for cells with numbers that have known mine counts. For example, cell (2,5)=1 has one mine (the flagged (2,6)), so all other adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (2,5) are all numbers, so no '?' there.\n\nCell (3,5)=1 (row 3, column 5). Adjacent cells: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=F, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. So (3,5)=1 has one mine (F at (2,6)), so the rest are safe. No '?' adjacent.\n\nCell (4,6)=1 (row 4, column 6). Adjacent cells: (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?. So (4,6)=1 has 1 mine. The adjacent '?' cells are (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nCell (5,6)=1 (row 5, column 6). Adjacent cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. So (5,6)=1 has 1 mine. Adjacent '?' cells: (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nCell (6,6)=1 (row 6, column 6). Adjacent cells: (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=?, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?. So (6,6)=1 has 1 mine. Adjacent '?' cells: (5,7), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a '?' cell that is in a region with the most 0s, assuming it's safe. For example, row 4, column 0=? (row 4, column 0). Let's see, the cells to the left of row 4 are \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\". The 1 at (4,2) (row 4, column 2) has adjacent cells: (3,1)=1, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0. So (4,2)=1 has 1 mine. The adjacent '?' is (4,1). So (4,1) might be a mine. If (4,1) is a mine, then (4,2)=1 is satisfied. Then, (4,0) is adjacent to (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=F (mine), (5,0)=1, (5,1)=1. So (4,0) would be adjacent to 1 mine (if (4,1) is a mine), so (4,0) would be a 1. But we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for the first '?' in the board. The first row (row 0) has '?' starting at column 7. Let's pick (0,7). Uncovering (0,7) might be safe. If it's a number, we can get more info. Since the game hasn't ended yet, and we need to make a move, I'll choose to uncover (0,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,7)","uncover (0,7)"],"unflags":0,"seed":8,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to figure out the first move for the Minesweeper game. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 15 rows, which might be a typo. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe that's a mistake in the current board display. Anyway, the first move in Minesweeper is usually to uncover a cell, and typically the best strategy is to start in the middle or a corner. Since all cells are unknown (marked with ?), I should pick a cell to uncover. Let's choose (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but sometimes the first move is safe, but in some versions, the first move can't be a mine. The problem says the game ends if you uncover a mine, so I need to pick a cell that's likely safe. Since there's no information, any cell is as good as another. Maybe (4,4) as the center. Let's go with (4,4). So the action is 'uncover (4,4)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, there are 15 rows listed. Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake? Oh, no, maybe the user pasted it incorrectly. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the current board is a typo. Let me check again. The user provided a Current Board with 15 rows, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps I should focus on the 9x9 part. Wait, maybe the numbers are separated per row, and each row is a line. Let's count: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? — that's 15 elements, which is 15 columns. That's conflicting with the 9x9 rule. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. But regardless, I need to proceed.\n\nThe goal is to uncover a safe cell or flag a mine. Let's recall that the game has 10 mines. The current Flags are 0\/14, which might be a typo (since total mines are 10), but maybe it's 0\/10. The score is 0.0, so no correct flags yet.\n\nLooking at the board, let's take the first few rows. Let's assume each row is a line, and each element is a cell. Let's take row 0: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" — that's 15 cells. Maybe it's a 15x15 board? The problem statement said 9x9, but maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different size. Let's check the input again. The problem statement says \"the board is a 9x9 grid with 10 hidden mines\", but the current board has 15 rows, each with 15 elements. That's a contradiction. Maybe it's a typo, and the actual board is 15x15. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nThe task is to find a cell to uncover that is safe (not a mine) or flag a mine. Let's look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and see if we can deduce if they are safe or mines.\n\nLet's take a cell that's adjacent to a number. For example, in row 2 (third line: 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 ? 2 0 0 0 0), there's a '3' at (2,8) (assuming rows and cols start at 0). The '3' means there are 3 mines in the 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (2,8) would be (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). Let's check those:\n\n(1,7): '?', (1,8): '?', (1,9): '?', (2,7): '1', (2,9): '?', (3,7): '0', (3,8): '1', (3,9): '?'.\n\nThe '3' needs 3 mines in those 8 cells. The known cells here are (2,7)=1 (safe, since it's a number), (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe). So the unknown cells are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). That's 5 cells, and 3 mines needed. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother example: row 0, column 2 is '1' (0,2). Adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=1 (safe). So (0,3) and (1,3) are the unknowns (both '?'). The '1' at (0,2) needs 1 mine in those adjacent cells. So either (0,3) or (1,3) is a mine, but not both.\n\nRow 0, column 4 is '1' (0,4). Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,5)=0 (safe), (1,4)=1 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe). So (0,3) and (1,3) are the unknowns. The '1' at (0,4) also needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. So again, (0,3) and (1,3) must have exactly 1 mine (from (0,2)'s 1) and (0,4)'s 1 also requires 1 mine here. So combining, (0,3) and (1,3) have exactly 1 mine. That's consistent.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 10 is '2' (1,10). Adjacent cells: (0,9), (0,10), (0,11), (1,9), (1,11), (2,9), (2,10), (2,11). (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=?, (1,11)=1, (2,9)=?, (2,10)=2, (2,11)=0. The '2' at (1,10) needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. (1,11)=1 (safe), (2,11)=0 (safe). So the remaining cells are (0,9), (0,10), (0,11), (1,9), (2,9), (2,10). (2,10)=2 (safe). So 5 cells, need 2 mines. Not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell, which means all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 2, column 11 is '0' (2,11). Adjacent cells: (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,10), (2,12), (3,10), (3,11), (3,12). (1,10)=2, (1,11)=1, (1,12)=1, (2,10)=2, (2,12)=0, (3,10)=1, (3,11)=0, (3,12)=0. The '0' at (2,11) means all adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to (2,11) can be uncovered safely. Let's check (2,12) is 0, (3,12)=0, (1,12)=1. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 3, column 7 is '0' (3,7). Adjacent cells: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=3, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All are numbers, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 4, column 11 is '0' (4,11). Adjacent cells: (3,10), (3,11), (3,12), (4,10), (4,12), (5,10), (5,11), (5,12). (3,10)=1, (3,11)=0, (3,12)=0, (4,10)=1, (4,12)=0, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=1, (5,12)=1. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is '0' (5,5). Adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=1, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is '0' (6,5). Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=1, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is '0' (7,5). Adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is '0' (8,5). Adjacent cells: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 9, column 5 is '0' (9,5). Adjacent cells: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=0, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=0, (10,5)=0, (10,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nRow 10, column 5 is '0' (10,5). Adjacent cells: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (10,4), (10,6), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=0, (10,6)=0, (11,4)=0, (11,5)=0, (11,6)=0. All numbers, no '?'.\n\nHmm, maybe looking for a cell with '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe. Let's check row 3, column 3 is '0' (3,3). Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0. All numbers, so no '?'.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is '0' (3,4). Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. All numbers, so no '?'.\n\nWait, the user's example input includes 'uncover (3,4)', which might be a hint. Let's check (3,4) in the current board. Looking at the third row (row 3): \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0\". So row 3, column 4 is '0' (since it's the 5th element, indexes 0-14). So (3,4) is already uncovered as 0. So that's not a '?'.\n\nLet's find a '?'. Let's look at row 0, column 3: '?'. Adjacent to (0,2)=1 and (0,4)=1. As discussed earlier, (0,3) and (1,3) have exactly 1 mine. So (0,3) might be safe or a mine. Not sure.\n\nRow 0, column 7: '?'. Let's check (0,6)=1 (0,6). Adjacent cells to (0,6): (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. So (0,7) and (1,7) are '?'. The '1' at (0,6) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. So either (0,7) or (1,7) is a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=3. The '1' at (1,6) has adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (1,5)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So unknowns are (0,7) and (1,7). So (1,6) is 1, which means 1 mine in (0,7) and (1,7). That matches the (0,6) 1's condition. So (0,7) and (1,7) have 1 mine total.\n\nRow 2, column 9: '?'. Adjacent to (2,8)=3. Let's see, (2,8)=3 has adjacent cells (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7)=1, (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=?. So from (2,8)=3, the mines are in 3 of those 8 cells. Known safe cells: (2,7)=1 (number, so safe), (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe). So the unknowns are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). So 5 cells, 3 mines.\n\nRow 6, column 3: '?'. Let's check (6,2)=1 (6,2). Adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1)=0, (6,3)=?, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=1. (5,1)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=1. So the '1' at (6,2) has adjacent cells. The unknown is (6,3). The '1' at (6,2) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (5,1)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=?, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=1. The numbers (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=1 are safe (they are numbers, so not mines). So the only unknown is (6,3). So the '1' at (6,2) must have exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells. The known safe cells are all except (6,3). So (6,3) must be a mine. Because the '1' at (6,2) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells, and all other adjacent cells are safe (numbers), so (6,3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (6,3).\n\nWait, let's confirm. (6,2) is row 6, column 2 (since rows are 0-based). The cell (6,2) has value 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,1): 0 (safe)\n- (5,2): 1 (safe)\n- (5,3): 1 (safe)\n- (6,1): 0 (safe)\n- (6,3): ? (unknown)\n- (7,1): 0 (safe)\n- (7,2): 1 (safe)\n- (7,3): 1 (safe)\n\nAll the adjacent cells except (6,3) are numbers (so safe, not mines). The '1' at (6,2) indicates there is 1 mine in these 8 adjacent cells. Since all others are safe, the only possible mine is (6,3). Therefore, (6,3) must be a mine. So the correct action is to flag (6,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (6,3)","flag (6,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user has a score based on correct flags, but right now the Flags are 1\/14, which probably means they flagged 14 cells, but only 1 is correct. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered, so I need to make a move that's safe.\n\nLooking at the board, the rows are numbered from 0 to 14, and columns 0 to 14? Wait, the initial description said 9x9 grid, but the current board has 15 rows and 15 columns. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with the given board.\n\nLet's parse the current board. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list the rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? 2 1 1 2 1\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 ? 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 0 0\nRow 8: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 9: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ?\nRow 10:1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 11:? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12:? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13:? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 14:? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe 'F' in row 6, column 3 is a flagged cell. The '?' are unknown cells. The numbers are the count of adjacent mines.\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Since the user's score is low, maybe they flagged some wrong cells. Let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered.\n\nStarting with row 3, column 9 (since row 3 is index 3, columns are 0-14). Row 3 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (3,9). Let's check adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (3,8) which is 1. The cell to the right is (3,10) which is 1. What about above and below?\n\nRow 2, column 9 is '?', row 4, column 9 is 1. The cell (3,8) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. (3,8) is at (3,8), so its neighbors are (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (3,7) is 0, (4,7) is 0, (4,8) is 1, (2,7) is 1, (2,8) is 3, (2,9) is ?, (3,9) is ?, (4,9) is 1. So (3,8) is 1, which has neighbors including (3,9). The cell (3,10) is 1. (3,10) is at (3,10), neighbors are (2,9), (2,10), (2,11), (3,9), (3,11), (4,9), (4,10), (4,11). (2,10) is 2, (2,11) is 0, (3,11) is 0, (4,9) is 1, (4,10) is 1, (4,11) is 0. So (3,10) is 1, which might have a mine in (3,9) or (2,9). But maybe (3,9) is safe?\n\nAlternatively, look at row 0, column 3. Row 0: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\". The cell (0,3) is '?'. The cell to the left is (0,2)=1, which is 1. (0,2) has neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=?. So (0,2)=1, which means one of (0,3) or (1,3) is a mine. The cell (0,4)=1, which is to the right of (0,3). (0,4) has neighbors: (0,3)=?, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0. So (0,4)=1, which would require one mine in (0,3) or (1,3). Since (0,2)=1 and (0,4)=1, both pointing to (0,3) and (1,3) as possible mine locations. If (0,3) and (1,3) are the only possible, then if (0,3) is a mine, (1,3) is safe, and vice versa. But since there's no way to know, maybe not safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 ? 2 0 0 0 0\". (2,8)=3. Let's check (2,8)=3. Its neighbors are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7)=1, (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=?. So (2,8)=3. The known numbers here: (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, (1,9)=?, (2,7)=1, (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=?. So (2,8)=3 has 3 mines in those 8 cells. (3,7)=0, so no mine there. (3,8)=1, which is a number, so not a mine. So (2,7)=1 is a number, not a mine. So the possible cells are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). So 5 cells, need 3 mines. Maybe not helpful.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 11: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\". (6,11) is '?'. The cell (6,10)=1, (6,12)=1. (6,10) is 1, neighbors: (5,9), (5,10), (5,11), (6,9)=0, (6,11)=?, (7,9)=1, (7,10)=2, (7,11)=1. (6,10)=1, so one mine in its neighbors. (6,12)=1, neighbors: (5,11), (5,12), (5,13), (6,11)=?, (6,13)=0, (7,11)=1, (7,12)=1, (7,13)=0. (6,12)=1, so one mine in its neighbors. Maybe (6,11) is safe if the mines are elsewhere.\n\nAnother area: row 9, column 2: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ?\". (9,2) is '?'. The cell (9,1)=1. (9,1) has neighbors: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=1, (8,2)=1, (9,0)=0, (9,2)=?, (10,0)=1, (10,1)=2, (10,2)=2. (9,1)=1, so one mine in those 8 cells. (8,1)=1 is a number, (8,2)=1 is a number, (10,0)=1, (10,1)=2, (10,2)=2 are numbers. (8,0)=0, (9,0)=0 are safe. So the only possible mine is (9,2). So (9,2) must be a mine? Wait, (9,1)=1. The neighbors are (8,0)=0 (safe), (8,1)=1 (safe), (8,2)=1 (safe), (9,0)=0 (safe), (9,2)=? (unknown), (10,0)=1 (safe), (10,1)=2 (safe), (10,2)=2 (safe). So all neighbors except (9,2) are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So (9,1)=1 must have exactly one mine in its neighbors. Since all other neighbors are safe (they are numbers, which are not mines), then (9,2) must be the mine. So (9,2) is a mine! Therefore, the user should flag (9,2). But wait, the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag. The user's current flags are 1\/14, so they might have some wrong flags. But let's confirm.\n\n(9,1) is 1. The 8 adjacent cells to (9,1) are:\n\n(8,0): 0 (safe, not a mine)\n(8,1): 1 (safe, number, so not a mine)\n(8,2): 1 (safe, number, not a mine)\n(9,0): 0 (safe)\n(9,2): ? (unknown)\n(10,0): 1 (safe)\n(10,1): 2 (safe)\n(10,2): 2 (safe)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (9,2) are safe (since they are numbers, which are not mines). Therefore, the 1 in (9,1) must be because (9,2) is a mine. So (9,2) is a mine. So the correct action would be to flag (9,2). But the user's current flags are 1\/14, so maybe they have 14 flags, 1 correct. So if we flag (9,2), that's a correct one. But let's check another cell to confirm.\n\nAnother example: row 10, column 0: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\". (10,0)=1. Its neighbors are (9,0)=0, (9,1)=1, (9,2)=?, (10,1)=2, (11,0)=?, (11,1)=?. So (10,0)=1, which has 1 mine in those 6 cells (since (9,0) and (9,1) are safe). (9,2) is a possible mine here. If (9,2) is a mine, then (10,0)=1 is satisfied. That aligns with the previous conclusion.\n\nAnother cell: row 8, column 9: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1\". (8,9) is '?'. The cell (8,8)=1. (8,8) has neighbors: (7,7)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (8,7)=0, (8,9)=?, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=1, (9,9)=1. (8,8)=1, so one mine in those 8 cells. (7,7)=0, (8,7)=0, (9,7)=0 are safe. (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (9,8)=1, (9,9)=1 are numbers (safe). So the only possible mine is (8,9). So (8,9) must be a mine? Let's check: (8,8)=1. All adjacent cells except (8,9) are safe (numbers or 0), so (8,9) must be the mine. So (8,9) is a mine. Therefore, (8,9) should be flagged.\n\nWait, but let's confirm (8,8)=1. The 8 neighbors are:\n\n(7,7): 0 (safe)\n(7,8): 1 (safe)\n(7,9): 1 (safe)\n(8,7): 0 (safe)\n(8,9): ? (unknown)\n(9,7): 0 (safe)\n(9,8): 1 (safe)\n(9,9): 1 (safe)\n\nYes, all are safe except (8,9). So (8,9) must be a mine. So (8,9) is a mine.\n\nSimilarly, (9,2) is a mine. Let's check if there are other cells that can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9 again. (3,9) is '?'. Let's check (3,8)=1. (3,8) has neighbors:\n\n(2,7): 1 (safe)\n(2,8): 3 (safe)\n(2,9): ? (unknown)\n(3,7): 0 (safe)\n(3,9): ? (unknown)\n(4,7): 0 (safe)\n(4,8): 1 (safe)\n(4,9): 1 (safe)\n\nSo (3,8)=1 has two unknown cells: (2,9) and (3,9). Since (3,8)=1, there's 1 mine in those two. Then (3,10)=1. (3,10) has neighbors:\n\n(2,9): ? (unknown)\n(2,10): 2 (safe)\n(2,11): 0 (safe)\n(3,9): ? (unknown)\n(3,11): 0 (safe)\n(4,9): 1 (safe)\n(4,10): 1 (safe)\n(4,11): 0 (safe)\n\nSo (3,10)=1 has two unknown cells: (2,9) and (3,9). So (3,8)=1 and (3,10)=1 both have 1 mine in (2,9) and (3,9). So that means exactly one of (2,9) or (3,9) is a mine. Therefore, if we uncover (3,9), if it's a number, then (2,9) is a mine, and vice versa. But we can't be sure. However, maybe there's a safe cell elsewhere.\n\nLooking at row 13, column 0: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (13,0) is '?'. The cell (13,1)=1. (13,1) has neighbors: (12,0)=?, (12,1)=1, (12,2)=1, (13,0)=?, (13,2)=0, (14,0)=?, (14,1)=1, (14,2)=0. (13,1)=1. The known cells: (12,1)=1 (safe), (12,2)=1 (safe), (13,2)=0 (safe), (14,1)=1 (safe), (14,2)=0 (safe). So unknown cells are (12,0), (13,0), (14,0). So (13,1)=1 must have 1 mine in those three. But (14,0) is '?', (13,0) is '?', (12,0) is '?'. Not helpful.\n\nRow 14, column 0: \"? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (14,0) is '?'. (14,1)=1. (14,1) has neighbors: (13,0)=?, (13,1)=1, (13,2)=0, (14,0)=?, (14,2)=0, (15,0) which doesn't exist, etc. So (14,1)=1's neighbors are (13,0), (13,1), (13,2), (14,0), (14,2). (13,1)=1 (safe), (13,2)=0 (safe), (14,2)=0 (safe). So mines could be in (13,0) or (14,0). So (14,1)=1 has 1 mine in (13,0) or (14,0). Not helpful.\n\nLooking back at the cells we identified as mines: (8,9) and (9,2). Let's confirm (8,9). (8,9) is in row 8, column 9. The cell (8,8)=1, which we determined must have (8,9) as a mine. So if we flag (8,9), that's a correct flag. Similarly, (9,2) is a mine.\n\nBut the user's current action can be to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a safe cell. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, which is safe. All 0 cells have no adjacent mines, so their adjacent cells can be uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 0: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\". The 0s in row 0, columns 0 and 1 (0,0 and 0,1) are 0, so their adjacent cells are safe. (0,0) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. (0,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. All are safe. (0,1) is 0, adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1. All safe. So the '?' cells adjacent to 0s might be safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0\". All these 0s in row 3, columns 0-7 (0-7) are 0, so their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (3,7)=0, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. (3,7) is at (3,7). Its adjacent cells are (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=3, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All of these are numbers, so safe. So any '?' adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered safely.\n\nWait, (3,8)=1 is a number, so it's safe. The '?' in row 3, column 9 is (3,9). The 0s in row 3, columns 0-7 mean that all their adjacent cells are safe, but (3,9) is further away. Let's look for 0 cells and their adjacent '?'.\n\nRow 4, columns 0-7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\". These are 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. All safe. So any '?' adjacent to these 0s would be safe.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-5: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\". (5,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=1, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All safe. So (5,5)=0's adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 1, column 7: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? 2 1 1 2 1\". (1,7) is '?'. Let's check (1,6)=1. (1,6)=1 has neighbors: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6)=1, which has 1 mine in its neighbors. The known cells: (0,5)=0, (1,5)=0, (2,5)=0 are safe. (0,6)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1 are safe. So the unknowns are (0,7) and (1,7). So (1,6)=1 has 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). Not sure.\n\nAnother area: row 2, column 5 is 0. (2,5)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (2,5) is at (2,5). Adjacent cells: (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0. All are numbers, so safe. So any '?' adjacent to (2,5) would be safe, but (2,5) is surrounded by numbers.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9: '?'. Let's see row 4, column 9 is 1. (4,9)=1. Its neighbors are (3,8)=1, (3,9)=?, (3,10)=1, (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,9)=0, (5,10)=1. (4,9)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. The known cells: (3,8)=1, (3,10)=1, (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,9)=0, (5,10)=1 are all safe. So the only unknown is (3,9). So (4,9)=1 must have (3,9) as a mine? Wait, (4,9)=1's neighbors:\n\n(3,8):1 (safe)\n(3,9):? (unknown)\n(3,10):1 (safe)\n(4,8):1 (safe)\n(4,10):1 (safe)\n(5,8):0 (safe)\n(5,9):0 (safe)\n(5,10):1 (safe)\n\nSo all neighbors except (3,9) are safe. Therefore, (4,9)=1 must have (3,9) as the mine. So (3,9) is a mine. Oh! That's a key point. So (4,9)=1 has 8 neighbors, and all except (3,9) are safe (numbers or 0), so (3,9) must be a mine. Therefore, (3,9) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover (3,9).\n\nBut earlier, (3,8)=1 has (2,9) and (3,9) as possible mines. If (3,9) is a mine, then (2,9) is safe. Let's check (2,9). (2,9) is '?'. (2,8)=3. (2,8)=3's neighbors are (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, (1,9)=?, (2,7)=1, (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=mine (as per above). So (2,8)=3 has 3 mines in its neighbors. We know (3,9) is a mine. So the remaining two mines must be in (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). Because (2,7)=1 (safe), (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe). So (2,8)=3 has 3 mines: (3,9) is one, so two more in (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9).\n\nBut maybe I should focus on finding a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which means it's safe. For example, row 3, column 7 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe. The cell (3,7) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's list them:\n\n(2,6):1 (safe)\n(2,7):1 (safe)\n(2,8):3 (safe)\n(3,6):0 (safe)\n(3,8):1 (safe)\n(4,6):0 (safe)\n(4,7):0 (safe)\n(4,8):1 (safe)\n\nAll are safe, so no mines there. Now, looking for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 3, column 9 is a '?', but we think it's a mine. What about row 1, column 5: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? 2 1 1 2 1\". (1,5)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=1, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. All are safe, so (1,5)=0's adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to (1,5) would be safe, but (1,5) is surrounded by numbers.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\". (4,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. All safe. So (4,5)=0's adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are '?' and have all adjacent numbers that are satisfied, meaning they can be uncovered safely. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. (0,5)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (0,5) is at (0,5). Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=1, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. All are safe, so (0,5)=0's adjacent cells are safe. The cell (0,7) is '?', which is adjacent to (0,6)=1. (0,6)=1 has neighbors: (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?. So (0,6)=1 has 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7, column 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 0 0\". (7,8)=1. Its neighbors are (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, (6,9)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,9)=1, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=mine (as we determined earlier). So (7,8)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. (8,9) is a mine, so that's the one. So (7,8)=1 is satisfied.\n\nRow 8, column 8=1. (8,8)=1 has neighbors (7,7)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (8,7)=0, (8,9)=mine, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=1, (9,9)=1. So (8,8)=1 has one mine (8,9), which is correct.\n\nSo (8,9) is a mine. So we should flag (8,9). Similarly, (9,2) is a mine. Let's confirm (9,2) again. (9,1)=1. Its neighbors are (8,0)=0, (8,1)=1, (8,2)=1, (9,0)=0, (9,2)=?, (10,0)=1, (10,1)=2, (10,2)=2. All neighbors except (9,2) are safe, so (9,2) must be a mine. So flagging (9,2) is correct.\n\nBut the user's current action could be to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a safe cell. For example, row 3, column 4 is 0. (3,4)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (3,4) is at (3,4). Its adjacent cells are (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. All are safe. So any '?' adjacent to (3,4) would be safe, but (3,4) is surrounded by 0s and 1s.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 9 is a mine, so we shouldn't uncover it. What about row 2, column 9? (2,9) is '?'. If (3,9) is a mine, then (2,8)=3 has one mine at (3,9), so needs two more mines in (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9). So (2,9) could be a mine or not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 13, column 2 is 0. (13,2)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (13,2) has neighbors (12,1)=1, (12,2)=1, (12,3)=0, (13,1)=1, (13,3)=0, (14,1)=1, (14,2)=0, (14,3)=0. All are safe. So (13,2)=0's adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 4, column 10 is 1. (4,10)=1. Its neighbors are (3,9)=mine, (3,10)=1, (3,11)=0, (4,9)=1, (4,11)=0, (5,9)=0, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=1. So (4,10)=1 has one mine at (3,9), which is correct. So (4,10)=1 is satisfied.\n\nAfter analyzing, I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 3, column 7 is 0. The cell (3,7)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The cell (3,8)=1 is safe, which we've checked. What about row 3, column 9? No, that's a mine.\n\nWait, let's look at row 1, column 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? 2 1 1 2 1\". (1,10)=2. Its neighbors are (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=?, (1,11)=1, (2,9)=?, (2,10)=2, (2,11)=0. (1,10)=2 has 2 mines in its neighbors. (2,11)=0 is safe, (1,11)=1 is safe, (2,10)=2 is safe. So unknowns are (0,9), (0,10), (0,11), (1,9), (2,9). Not helpful.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 5, column 7 is 0. (5,7)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (5,7) has neighbors (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0. All are safe. So (5,7)=0's adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 11: '?'. (6,10)=1 has neighbors including (6,11)=?, but we can't be sure. \n\nMaybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and has no possible mines. For example, row 3, column 3 is 0. (3,3)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (3,3) has neighbors (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0. All safe. So any '?' adjacent to (3,3) would be safe, but (3,3) is surrounded by numbers.\n\nAfter all this, I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is known to be safe. Let's check row 3, column 9 is a mine, so avoid that. Let's look at row 8, column 9 is a mine, so flag that. But the user might need to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. The cell (0,5)=0, so (0,4)=1 and (0,6)=1 are safe. The cell (0,7) is '?', which is adjacent to (0,6)=1. (0,6)=1 has neighbors (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?. So (0,6)=1 has 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). If I uncover (0,7), if it's a number, then (1,7) is a mine, but if it's a mine, the game ends. But maybe there's a better cell.\n\nAlternatively, row 3, column 9 is a mine, so let's not uncover that. Let's look at row 2, column 9. If (3,9) is a mine, then (2,8)=3 has 3 mines. (3,9) is one, so (2,8)=3 needs two more. So (2,9) could be a mine, but not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at row 4, column 9=1. We determined (3,9) is a mine. So (4,9)=1 has one mine at (3,9), which is correct. So (4,9)=1 is satisfied.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 5, column 8=0. (5,8)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (5,8) has neighbors (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (5,7)=0, (5,9)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, (6,9)=0. All safe.\n\nAfter considering all, I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and has no possible mines. For example, row 3, column 9 is a mine, so avoid. Let's pick row 0, column 3. Wait, (0,3) is '?'. (0,2)=1, which has neighbors (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=?. So (0,2)=1 has 1 mine in (0,3) or (1,3). If I uncover (0,3), if it's a number, then (1,3) is a mine. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 9 is a mine, so (3,9) is 'F'? No, it's '?'. So the user hasn't flagged it. Since the user's current flags are 1\/14, they might have flagged (6,3) which is 'F' in row 6, column 3. Let's check (6,3)=F. (6,2)=1, (6,4)=1. (6,3) is flagged. (6,2)=1 has neighbors (5,1)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=F, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=1. So (6,2)=1 has 1 mine. If (6,3) is a mine, then that's correct. (6,4)=1 has neighbors (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=F, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0. So (6,4)=1 has 1 mine. If (6,3) is a mine, then (6,2)=1 and (6,4)=1 are both satisfied. So (6,3) is likely a correct flag. That's the 1 correct flag out of 14. So the user flagged (6,3) correctly.\n\nNow, to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look at row 3, column 9 is a mine, so avoid. Let's look at row 8, column 9 is a mine, so avoid. What about row 9, column 2 is a mine, so avoid.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 13, column 3 is 0. (13,3)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (13,3) has neighbors (12,2)=1, (12,3)=0, (12,4)=0, (13,2)=0, (13,4)=0, (14,2)=0, (14,3)=0, (14,4)=0. All safe. So (13,3)=0's adjacent cells are safe. The cell (13,0) is '?', which is adjacent to (13,1)=1. (13,1)=1 has neighbors (12,0)=?, (12,1)=1, (12,2)=1, (13,0)=?, (13,2)=0, (14,0)=?, (14,1)=1, (14,2)=0. So (13,1)=1 has 1 mine in (12,0), (13,0), (14,0). Not helpful.\n\nAfter all this, I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to multiple 0s and has a high chance of being safe. Let's pick row 3, column 9 is a mine, so avoid. Let's pick row 0, column 7. (0,7) is '?'. (0,6)=1 has neighbors (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?. So (0,6)=1 has 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). If we uncover (0,7), if it's a 0, then (1,7) is a mine. If it's a 1, then (1,7) is safe. But it's a risk. Alternatively, let's pick a cell that's in a 0 area.\n\nLooking at row 3, columns 0-7 are all 0s. The cell (3,7)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The cell (3,8)=1 is safe. The cell (3,9) is a mine. So the '?' in row 3, column 9 is a mine. So the safe cells around row 3 are all uncovered except (3,9).\n\nAnother area: row 4, columns 0-7 are 0s. All adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' in row 4, columns 0-7 are already uncovered (they are 0s). So the '?' are in other areas.\n\nAfter considering, I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is in a known safe area. For example, row 0, column 3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and has no possible mines. For example, row 3, column 3 is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The cell (3,3)=0, so (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0, (2,3)=1, etc. All are safe. So the '?' cells in row 3 are (3,9). So (3,9) is a mine, so we shouldn't uncover it.\n\nWait, the user's score is 0.0714, which is 1\/14 (since 1\/14 ≈ 0.0714). So they have 14 flags, 1 correct. The correct mine count is 10, so there are 10 mines. The user has 14 flags, 1 correct, so 13 incorrect flags. They need to flag all 10 mines to win. So maybe the best move is to flag the mines we identified: (8,9) and (9,2).\n\nLet's confirm (8,9) again. (8,8)=1 has neighbors all safe except (8,9), so (8,9) is a mine. So flagging (8,9) would increase the correct flags to 2. Similarly, (9,2) is a mine. So the action could be 'flag (8,9)' or 'flag (9,2)'.\n\nAlternatively, the user might need to uncover a safe cell to progress. Let's find a safe cell. For example, row 0, column 7 is '?'. Let's assume it's safe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, row 1, column 7 is '?'. (1,6)=1 has neighbors (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6)=1 has 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). If we uncover (1,7), if it's a 0, then (0,7) is a mine. If it's a 1, then (0,7) is safe. But it's a risk.\n\nAfter all this, I think the best move is to flag (8,9) as a mine. So the action is 'flag (8,9)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (8,9)","flag (8,9)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user has provided the current state, and we need to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell.\n\nFirst, let's recall the rules. The board is 9x9, but looking at the current board, the rows are numbered from 0 to 14? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the problem says the board is 9x9, but the current board shows 15 rows (0 to 14). Hmm, maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10 (total mines). The current score is 0.142857..., which is 1\/7, but the user says Flags: 2\/14. Wait, 2 correct flags out of 14 flagged? Because 2\/14 is 1\/7, which matches the score. So there are 14 flagged cells, but only 2 are correct. That's a problem. So some of the F's are incorrect.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's list the F positions. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → F at (6,3)\nRow 8: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1\" → F at (8,9)\n\nSo there are two F's. Wait, the user said Flags: 2\/14. Oh, maybe the board is 15x15? Because 15 rows, each with 15 columns. The initial problem statement might have a typo. So 15x15 grid, 10 mines. That makes more sense with 15 rows. So the coordinate (row, col) ranges from (0,0) to (14,14).\n\nThe current flags are at (6,3) and (8,9). The user has flagged 2 cells, but 14 total? Wait, the \"Flags: 2\/14\" probably means 2 correct flags out of 14 flagged cells. So there are 14 F's on the board, but only 2 are actual mines. So we need to unflag the incorrect ones.\n\nBut let's focus on the current board. Let's look for cells that can be determined to be safe or mines.\n\nLet's start by analyzing some numbered cells. For example, take row 2: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 3 ? 2 0 0 0 0\"\n\nAt row 2, column 8: value 3. The adjacent cells are the cells around (2,8). Let's list the adjacent cells:\n\n(1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9)\n\nCurrent state of these cells:\n\nRow 1, column 7: \"?\"\nRow 1, column 8: \"?\"\nRow 1, column 9: \"?\"\nRow 2, column 7: \"1\"\nRow 2, column 9: \"?\" (the cell to the right of 3)\nRow 3, column 7: \"0\"\nRow 3, column 8: \"1\"\nRow 3, column 9: \"?\"\n\nThe 3 at (2,8) means there are 3 mines in those 8 adjacent cells. Let's see which are known. (2,7) is 1, which is a number, so it's safe. (3,7) is 0, safe. (3,8) is 1, safe. So the unknown cells here are (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). So 5 cells, and 3 mines among them.\n\nAnother cell: row 2, column 10: \"2\". Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,10) is 2. Adjacent cells are (1,9), (1,10), (1,11), (2,9), (2,11), (3,9), (3,10), (3,11).\n\nRow 1, column 9: \"?\", row 1, column 10: \"2\", row 1, column 11: \"1\", row 2, column 9: \"?\", row 2, column 11: \"0\", row 3, column 9: \"?\", row 3, column 10: \"1\", row 3, column 11: \"0\".\n\nSo the 2 at (2,10) has adjacent cells: (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) are unknown (the rest are numbers or 0, which are safe). So (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) must contain 2 mines, since the 2 indicates two mines in adjacent cells.\n\nEarlier, from (2,8)=3, the mines are in (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) → 3 mines. From (2,10)=2, (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) have 2 mines. So let's denote M as mine, S as safe.\n\nLet’s let x = number of mines in (1,9), (2,9), (3,9). From (2,10)=2, x=2. Then, from (2,8)=3, the remaining cells (1,7), (1,8) must contain 3 - x = 1 mine. So (1,7) and (1,8) have 1 mine total.\n\nNow, let's look at row 1, column 6: \"1\". (1,6)=1. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nRow 0, column 5: \"0\", row 0, column 6: \"1\", row 0, column 7: \"?\", row 1, column 5: \"0\", row 1, column 7: \"?\", row 2, column 5: \"0\", row 2, column 6: \"1\", row 2, column 7: \"1\".\n\nSo (1,6)=1 has adjacent unknown cells: (0,7) and (1,7). The rest are safe (0,5 is 0, 1,5 is 0, 2,5 is 0, 2,6 is 1 (safe), 2,7 is 1 (safe), 0,6 is 1 (safe), 0,5 is 0). So the 1 mine must be in (0,7) or (1,7).\n\nFrom earlier, (1,7) and (1,8) have 1 mine. Let's see if we can connect these.\n\nRow 0, column 6: \"1\". (0,6)=1. Adjacent cells: (0-1,6-1) invalid, (0-1,6) invalid, (0-1,6+1) invalid, (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). So (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?. So (0,6)=1 has adjacent cells (0,7) and (1,7) as possible mines, and needs 1 mine. Which matches (1,6)=1's situation. So (0,7) and (1,7) have 1 mine, which is the same as (1,6)=1's 1 mine. So that's consistent.\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 7: \"?\". If (0,7) is a mine, then (1,7) is safe (since (0,6)=1 and (1,6)=1 both would have their mine here). Then, (1,7) is safe. Then, from (2,8)=3, (1,7) is safe, so (1,8) must be the mine (since (1,7) and (1,8) have 1 mine). So (1,8) is a mine. Then, (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) have 2 mines (from (2,10)=2). Let's check row 1, column 8: if (1,8) is a mine, then row 1, column 8 is a mine.\n\nBut let's see another cell. Row 1, column 7 is \"?\", row 1, column 8 is \"?\", row 1, column 9 is \"?\".\n\nRow 0, column 8: \"?\". Row 0, column 9: \"?\".\n\nRow 3, column 9: \"?\". Let's check row 3, column 8: \"1\". (3,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,7)=1 (safe), (2,8)=3 (safe), (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,9)=?, (4,7)=0 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (4,9)=1 (safe). So (3,8)=1 has adjacent unknown cells (2,9) and (3,9), which must contain 1 mine.\n\nFrom (2,10)=2, (1,9), (2,9), (3,9) have 2 mines. Let's denote A=(1,9), B=(2,9), C=(3,9). So A+B+C=2. From (3,8)=1, B+C=1. Therefore, substituting, A + (B+C) = A +1 = 2 → A=1. So (1,9) is a mine. Then B+C=1.\n\nSo (1,9) is a mine. That's a conclusion. So (1,9) should be flagged. Let's check if it's currently flagged. Looking at row 1: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? ? ? 2 1 1 2 1\". The columns are 0-14. Row 1, column 9 is \"?\", so not flagged. So we should flag (1,9).\n\nWait, but let's confirm. (2,10)=2: adjacent cells include (1,9). If (1,9) is a mine, then the other mine in (2,10)'s adjacent cells would be either (2,9) or (3,9). And (3,8)=1 requires one of (2,9) or (3,9) to be a mine. So that's consistent.\n\nAnother angle: row 4, column 9: \"1\". (4,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), (4,8), (4,10), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10). (3,8)=1 (safe), (3,9)=?, (3,10)=1 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (4,10)=1 (safe), (5,8)=0 (safe), (5,9)=0 (safe), (5,10)=1 (safe). So (4,9)=1 has adjacent unknown cell (3,9). So (3,9) must be a mine? Because if (3,9) is safe, then there are 0 mines adjacent, which contradicts 1. So (3,9) is a mine.\n\nAh! That's a key point. (4,9) is 1. Its adjacent cells: let's list them properly. (4,9) is in row 4, column 9. The adjacent cells are:\n\nRow 3, column 8: (3,8)=1 (safe)\nRow 3, column 9: (3,9)=?\nRow 3, column 10: (3,10)=1 (safe)\nRow 4, column 8: (4,8)=1 (safe)\nRow 4, column 10: (4,10)=1 (safe)\nRow 5, column 8: (5,8)=0 (safe)\nRow 5, column 9: (5,9)=0 (safe)\nRow 5, column 10: (5,10)=1 (safe)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (3,9) are safe (numbers, so not mines). Therefore, (3,9) must be the mine to satisfy the 1. So (3,9) is a mine.\n\nThen, from (3,8)=1: (3,8) has adjacent cells (2,7)=1 (safe), (2,8)=3 (safe), (2,9)=?, (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,9)=mine (so that's 1 mine), (4,7)=0 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (4,9)=1 (safe). So (3,8)=1 is satisfied because (3,9) is a mine. That checks out.\n\nThen, from (2,10)=2: (2,10) has adjacent cells (1,9)=?, (1,10)=2 (safe), (1,11)=1 (safe), (2,9)=?, (2,11)=0 (safe), (3,9)=mine (1), (3,10)=1 (safe), (3,11)=0 (safe). So the 2 mines must be (1,9) and (2,9). Because (3,9) is already a mine (1), so (2,10) has (3,9) as 1 mine, so needs 1 more. Wait, no: (2,10) is 2, meaning two mines in adjacent cells. We already have (3,9) as a mine, so there must be one more mine in (1,9) or (2,9).\n\nWait, let's recheck (2,10)'s adjacent cells. (2,10) is at row 2, column 10. The eight adjacent cells are:\n\nrow 1, column 9 → (1,9)\nrow 1, column 10 → (1,10)=2 (safe)\nrow 1, column 11 → (1,11)=1 (safe)\nrow 2, column 9 → (2,9)\nrow 2, column 11 → (2,11)=0 (safe)\nrow 3, column 9 → (3,9)=mine (1)\nrow 3, column 10 → (3,10)=1 (safe)\nrow 3, column 11 → (3,11)=0 (safe)\n\nSo the adjacent cells that could be mines are (1,9) and (2,9). Since (3,9) is a mine, that's one mine. So (2,10)=2 requires two mines, so (1,9) and (2,9) must both be mines. Because 1 (from (3,9)) + 2 (from (1,9) and (2,9)) would be 3, which is too much. Wait, no: (3,9) is adjacent to (2,10), right? Let's confirm the adjacency. (2,10) and (3,9): row difference is 1, column difference is 1 (10-9=1). So yes, they are diagonal neighbors. So (3,9) is adjacent to (2,10). So (3,9) is a mine, which counts towards (2,10)'s 2. So (2,10) has (3,9) as one mine. Then there must be one more mine in the adjacent cells. The remaining possible cells are (1,9) and (2,9). So one of them is a mine.\n\nBut earlier, from (4,9)=1, we determined (3,9) is a mine. Then (3,8)=1 is satisfied because (3,9) is a mine. Now, (2,8)=3: (2,8) is at row 2, column 8. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 1, column 7 → (1,7)\nrow 1, column 8 → (1,8)\nrow 1, column 9 → (1,9)\nrow 2, column 7 → (2,7)=1 (safe)\nrow 2, column 9 → (2,9)\nrow 3, column 7 → (3,7)=0 (safe)\nrow 3, column 8 → (3,8)=1 (safe)\nrow 3, column 9 → (3,9)=mine (1)\n\nSo (2,8)=3 has adjacent mines: (3,9) is 1. So the remaining 2 mines must be in (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,9).\n\nWe also have (1,6)=1: row 1, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 0, column 5 → 0 (safe)\nrow 0, column 6 → 1 (safe)\nrow 0, column 7 → (0,7)\nrow 1, column 5 → 0 (safe)\nrow 1, column 7 → (1,7)\nrow 2, column 5 → 0 (safe)\nrow 2, column 6 → 1 (safe)\nrow 2, column 7 → 1 (safe)\n\nSo (1,6)=1 must have 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7).\n\n(0,6)=1: row 0, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 0, column 5 → 0 (safe)\nrow 0, column 7 → (0,7)\nrow 1, column 5 → 0 (safe)\nrow 1, column 6 → 1 (safe)\nrow 1, column 7 → (1,7)\n\nSo (0,6)=1 must have 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7), which matches (1,6)=1.\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 7: \"?\", row 0, column 8: \"?\", row 0, column 9: \"?\".\n\nRow 0, column 4: \"1\", row 0, column 5: \"0\", row 0, column 6: \"1\", row 0, column 7: \"?\", row 0, column 8: \"?\", row 0, column 9: \"?\".\n\nRow 1, column 4: \"1\", row 1, column 5: \"0\", row 1, column 6: \"1\", row 1, column 7: \"?\", row 1, column 8: \"?\", row 1, column 9: \"?\".\n\nRow 2, column 4: \"1\", row 2, column 5: \"0\", row 2, column 6: \"1\", row 2, column 7: \"1\", row 2, column 8: \"3\", row 2, column 9: \"?\", row 2, column 10: \"2\".\n\nLet's try to find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 9 is a mine (from (4,9)=1), so we should flag that. But is (3,9) currently flagged? Let's check row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0\". Column 9 is \"?\", so not flagged. So flag (3,9).\n\nWait, but let's confirm (4,9)=1. (4,9) is 1, and the only adjacent unknown cell is (3,9). So (3,9) must be a mine. Therefore, (3,9) is a mine. So we should flag (3,9).\n\nAnother cell: row 5, column 11: \"1\". (5,11)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,10), (4,11), (4,12), (5,10), (5,12), (6,10), (6,11), (6,12). Let's check:\n\nrow 4, column 10: \"1\" (safe), row 4, column 11: \"0\" (safe), row 4, column 12: \"0\" (safe), row 5, column 10: \"1\" (safe), row 5, column 12: \"1\" (safe), row 6, column 10: \"1\" (safe), row 6, column 11: \"?\" (row 6: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → column 11 is \"?\"), row 6, column 12: \"1\" (safe). So (5,11)=1 has adjacent unknown cell (6,11). So (6,11) must be a mine. Let's check if (6,11) is flagged. Row 6, column 11 is \"?\", so not flagged. So flag (6,11).\n\nBut wait, (5,11)=1: adjacent cells are (6,11). If (6,11) is safe, then (5,11) would have 0 mines, which is wrong. So (6,11) must be a mine. So that's a mine.\n\nLet's check row 6, column 10: \"1\". (6,10)=1. Adjacent cells: (5,9), (5,10), (5,11), (6,9), (6,11), (7,9), (7,10), (7,11). (5,9)=0 (safe), (5,10)=1 (safe), (5,11)=1 (safe), (6,9)=0 (safe), (6,11)=mine (from above), (7,9)=1 (safe), (7,10)=2 (safe), (7,11)=1 (safe). So (6,10)=1 has (6,11) as a mine, which satisfies the 1. That's correct.\n\nAnother cell: row 7, column 10: \"2\". (7,10)=2. Adjacent cells: (6,9), (6,10), (6,11), (7,9), (7,11), (8,9), (8,10), (8,11). (6,9)=0 (safe), (6,10)=1 (safe), (6,11)=mine (1), (7,9)=1 (safe), (7,11)=1 (safe), (8,9)=F (flagged), (8,10)=1 (safe), (8,11)=0 (safe). So (7,10)=2 has (6,11) as 1 mine, and (8,9) is flagged. If (8,9) is a mine, then that's 2 mines, which matches the 2. So (8,9) being a mine would make sense here. Let's check the current flags: (8,9) is F. So if (8,9) is a mine, that's a correct flag. If it's not, then it's incorrect.\n\nFrom (7,10)=2, if (6,11) is a mine (1) and (8,9) is a mine (1), that totals 2, which matches. So (8,9) is likely a correct flag.\n\nRow 8, column 9 is F. Let's check other cells around (8,9). (8,8)=1, (8,9)=F, (8,10)=1. (8,8)=1: adjacent cells include (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). (7,7)=0 (safe), (7,8)=0 (safe), (7,9)=1 (safe), (8,7)=0 (safe), (8,9)=F (mine?), (9,7)=0 (safe), (9,8)=1 (safe), (9,9)=1 (safe). So (8,8)=1 would require (8,9) to be a mine, which matches if (8,9) is a mine. So (8,9) is probably a correct flag.\n\nNow, let's look for a cell that can be uncovered safely. For example, row 3, column 9 is a mine (flagged), but let's find a safe cell. Let's look at row 9, column 2: \"?\". Row 9: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ?\". Column 2 is \"?\". Let's check the adjacent cells. (9,2) is row 9, column 2. Adjacent cells: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3).\n\nRow 8, column 1: \"1\" (safe), row 8, column 2: \"1\" (safe), row 8, column 3: \"1\" (safe), row 9, column 1: \"1\" (safe), row 9, column 3: \"1\" (safe), row 10, column 1: \"2\" (safe), row 10, column 2: \"2\" (safe), row 10, column 3: \"1\" (safe). So all adjacent cells are safe (numbers), which means (9,2) is a safe cell with 0 adjacent mines. Because if all adjacent cells are safe (non-mine), then (9,2) must be a 0. So we can uncover (9,2).\n\nLet's confirm. (9,2) is surrounded by:\n\n(8,1)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1 → all safe (numbers, so not mines)\n(9,1)=1, (9,3)=1 → safe\n(10,1)=2, (10,2)=2, (10,3)=1 → safe\n\nSince all 8 adjacent cells are safe (not mines), the cell (9,2) must be a 0. Therefore, uncovering (9,2) is safe.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,2)","uncover (9,2)"],"unflags":0,"seed":7,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to play Minesweeper. The current board is all '?', which means all cells are unknown. The game is at the beginning, so I need to make a move. The first move in Minesweeper is usually safe because uncovering a mine on the first move would be bad, but according to the rules, the game ends if you uncover a mine. Wait, the rules say the game ends at the 100th epoch or if you uncover a mine. So I need to avoid mines.\n\nSince all cells are unknown, I should pick a starting cell. Typically, in Minesweeper, the corners or edges are common first moves, but maybe a central cell. Let's choose (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but (0,0) is the top-left. Let me check the input format example: 'uncover (3,4)' is an example, so coordinates are (row, col). The board is 9x9, so rows and cols go from 0 to 8. Wait, the current board shows 19 rows? Wait, no, the user probably made a mistake in the current board display. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nMinesweeper Game Rules: 1. The board is a 9x9 grid. Oh right, so 9 rows and 9 columns. But the current board shows 19 rows of '? ? ...', which is probably a formatting error. So the actual board is 9x9, with coordinates (0,0) to (8,8). So my first move can be any cell. Let's pick (0,0) as a safe starting point. So the action would be 'uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, there are 19 rows listed, which might be a formatting error. Wait, maybe it's a typo and each row is actually a 9-cell row? Let me check. The user mentioned it's a 9x9 grid, so perhaps the current board is presented with each row having 9 elements. Let me recount the rows. The given current board has 19 lines, each with numbers and ? or F. That's confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps the user intended each line to be a row of the 9x9 grid. Let's assume that, maybe the input was pasted incorrectly, but I need to proceed.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10. Currently, flags are 0\/11, which might mean 0 flags placed, and 11 possible flags (but total mines are 10, so maybe that's a typo). The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the board, cells marked with '?' are unknown. The numbers indicate the count of adjacent mines. The task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell.\n\nLet's look for cells where we can deduce a mine or a safe cell. For example, if a cell with number 1 has only one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. Conversely, if a cell with number 0 is uncovered, all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at the rows (assuming each line is a row, even if there are 19, maybe it's 0-18 rows, but 9x9 would be 0-8 rows. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's focus on the '?' cells. Let's pick a row with a '?' and check the adjacent numbers.\n\nFor example, let's take row 0 (first line): \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — but if it's 9x9, maybe each row is 9 cells. Let's assume each row is 9 cells. Let's correct that. So row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1], row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1], row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], etc. That makes more sense. So each row has 9 elements. Let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nSo row 0, columns 0-8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1] (columns 0-8). So column 7 in row 0 is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells to that '?'. The cell (0,6) is 1. The '?' is at (0,7). The cell (0,6) has a value of 1, meaning it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0 (safe), (0,7) is ?, (1,5) is 0 (safe), (1,6) is 1 (already uncovered), (1,7) is 1 (uncovered). So the only unknown adjacent cell to (0,6) is (0,7). Since (0,6) is 1, that means (0,7) must be a mine. Wait, but (0,6) is 1, so exactly one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. Wait, (1,6) and (1,7) are 1s, which are numbers, not mines. So the mine must be in (0,7). So (0,7) is a mine, so we should flag it.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. The cell (0,6) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (row-1, col-1): ( -1,5) invalid\n- (row-1, col): ( -1,6) invalid\n- (row-1, col+1): ( -1,7) invalid\n- (row, col-1): (0,5) = 0 (safe)\n- (row, col+1): (0,7) = ? (unknown)\n- (row+1, col-1): (1,5) = 0 (safe)\n- (row+1, col): (1,6) = 1 (safe, since it's a number)\n- (row+1, col+1): (1,7) = 1 (safe, number)\n\nSo the only adjacent cell that could be a mine is (0,7). Since (0,6) is 1, that means exactly one mine in adjacent cells, so (0,7) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (0,7).\n\nAnother example: let's check row 0, column 8: value 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=?, (0,9) invalid, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1, (1,9) invalid. So (0,8) is 1, adjacent cells are (0,7)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1. The 1s are safe, so (0,7) is the only possible mine here. So that confirms (0,7) is a mine. So flagging (0,7) is correct.\n\nAnother '?' in row 0, column 8? No, row 0, column 7 is '?', column 8 is 1. Let's check other '?' cells. For example, row 4, column 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — assuming row 4 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1,0]. So (4,6) is '?'. Let's check the cell (4,5) which is 1. Adjacent cells to (4,5) (row 4, column 5) are:\n\nrow 3, col 4: 0 (from row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0] so (3,4)=0)\nrow 3, col 5: 1 (3,5)=1\nrow 3, col 6: 1 (3,6)=1\nrow 4, col 4: 0 (4,4)=0\nrow 4, col 6: ? (4,6)=?\nrow 5, col 4: 0 (row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0] so (5,4)=0)\nrow 5, col 5: 1 (5,5)=1\nrow 5, col 6: 1 (5,6)=1\n\nSo (4,5) is 1. The adjacent cells include (4,6) as ?. The other adjacent cells are 0,1,1,0,1,1. The 1s are numbers, not mines. So the mine count for (4,5) is 1. How many mines are adjacent? Let's see: the cells that are numbers are safe, so the only possible mine is (4,6). So (4,5) has 1 mine, which must be (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) is a mine, so flag it.\n\nWait, but (4,5) is 1. Let's count the adjacent mines. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,6)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,6)=? (unknown), (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe). So all adjacent cells except (4,6) are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). Therefore, (4,5) being 1 means that (4,6) is a mine. So (4,6) should be flagged.\n\nAnother '?' in row 5, column 10? No, assuming 9x9, row 5 is [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0], [1,?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] — maybe the user's board formatting is off. Alternatively, perhaps the board is 19x19, but the problem states 9x9. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the '?' cells are in positions where the adjacent numbers can help. Let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell with number 0 is uncovered, all adjacent cells are safe. Let's find a 0. For example, row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So all cells in row 2 are 0. That means all adjacent cells to these 0s are safe. For example, (2,0) is 0, so (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1) are all safe. But those might already be uncovered. Let's check row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]. So (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 1. Row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. So (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is 1, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 0. So row 2's 0s are all uncovered, so their adjacent cells are safe and likely already uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number which has more known mines than its count, meaning the '?' is safe. For example, if a cell has a number 2, and there are already 2 flagged mines adjacent, then the remaining '?'s are safe. But since there are 0 flags now, that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, find a '?' that is adjacent to a number 0. But 0s have all adjacent cells safe, so if a '?' is adjacent to a 0, it's safe and can be uncovered. Let's check. For example, row 2 has 0s. The cell (2,7) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=0. All those are uncovered (numbers or 0s), so no '?' there.\n\nLooking at row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — if row 7 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], then (7,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (6,7)=0 (row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] — maybe row 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1], (6,8)=1). So (7,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (6,7)=0, (6,8)=1, (6,9) invalid, (7,7)=0, (7,9)=?, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,9) invalid. So (7,8)=1 has adjacent cell (7,9)=? (assuming 9x9, maybe (7,8) is column 8, so (7,9) is invalid. Maybe the board is 19 columns, but that's conflicting with the 9x9 rule. This is getting too confusing due to formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display, but let's pick a '?' that is likely a mine based on adjacent numbers. For example, in the first row (row 0), the '?' is at position (0,7) (assuming columns 0-8). The cell to the left is (0,6)=1, and the cell to the right is (0,8)=1. The cell below (row 1, column 7)=1. So (0,6)=1 has adjacent cells including (0,7)=?, which is the only unknown. So (0,7) must be a mine. So the action should be to flag (0,7).\n\nAnswer: flag (0,7)","flag (0,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the game rules. \n\nThe board is a 9x9 grid, but the given current board seems to have 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Oh, maybe each line represents a row, and each number or symbol is a cell. Let me check the input again. The user provided a \"Current Board\" with 19 lines, each line has 19 elements. Wait, that can't be right. Minesweeper is 9x9, so maybe the current board is displayed with 19 rows, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the board layout. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the key information: the score is 0.0909, which is 1\/11, so they've flagged 1 mine correctly out of 11 flagged. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The win condition is correctly flagging all 10 mines or uncovering all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to find cells that are safe to uncover or determine where mines are. Let's parse the board. Each cell is either a number, '?', or 'F'. The '?' are unknown, 'F' is flagged. The numbers indicate adjacent mines. \n\nLet's take an example row. The first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". So row 0, columns 0-18 (but that's 19 columns). Wait, 9x9 should be 9 rows and 9 columns. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Alternatively, perhaps it's a larger board, but the problem statement says 9x9. Maybe the current board is misformatted, but I need to work with what's given.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers are separated by spaces. Let's assume that each row is a list of cells. Let's look for 'F' which are flagged cells. In the first row, there's an 'F' at column 7 (since the row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?). So (0,7) is flagged. The score is 1\/11, meaning 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged. So there are 11 'F's on the board, but only 1 is a mine. The goal is to flag all 10 mines.\n\nNow, the task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Let's look for cells that are '?', which are unknown. The idea is to find cells that must be safe (so uncover them) or must be mines (so flag them), or perhaps unflag cells that are incorrectly flagged.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is '?'. For example, in row 0, columns 17 and 18 are '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. Let's take a '?' and see its neighbors. For example, let's look at row 4, column 6: the row is \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (4,6) is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left (4,5) is 1, the cell to the right (4,7) is 1. The cells above (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is ?, (3,7) is 1. The cells below (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 1. The cell (4,6) is surrounded by 1s. If (4,5) is 1, that means it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (4,5) is at (4,5), adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). The value at (4,5) is 1, so among these 8 cells, exactly 1 is a mine. Let's see which of these are known. (3,4) is 0, (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is ?, (4,4) is 0, (4,6) is ?, (5,4) is 0, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. So (4,5) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknowns here are (3,6) and (4,6). If (4,5) is 1, then exactly one of (3,6) or (4,6) is a mine. But (4,7) is 1. (4,7) is at (4,7), adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (4,7) is 1, so exactly one mine in those. (3,7) is 1 (from row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (3,7) is 1), (3,8) is 0, (4,8) is 0, (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 0. So (4,7)'s adjacent unknowns are (3,6) and (4,6). So (4,7) also has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which are (3,6) and (4,6). So (4,5) and (4,7) both have 1 mine in their adjacent cells, and both are looking at (3,6) and (4,6). That means that exactly one of (3,6) or (4,6) is a mine, and since both (4,5) and (4,7) require 1 mine, that one mine must be the same for both. So if (3,6) is a mine, then (4,6) is safe. If (4,6) is a mine, then (3,6) is safe. So (4,6) could be safe. Maybe we can uncover it.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell with 0. If a cell is 0, all adjacent cells are safe. Let's find a 0 and see adjacent '?'. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). If those are 0, maybe their adjacent cells are safe. But maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: the user has 11 flags, but only 1 is correct. So most 'F's are incorrect. Maybe we should unflag some. But the problem says \"Unflags: 0\" so far. So all flags are still there. If a flagged cell is adjacent to a number that's lower than the number of flags around it, that flag is wrong. For example, in row 0, column 7 is 'F'. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (0,6) which is 1. (0,6) has value 1, meaning 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,6) is at (0,6), adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, (0,7) is F (flagged), (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1. So (0,6) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,7) is a mine (flagged correctly), then that's the 1 mine. But (1,6) is 1. (1,6) is at (1,6), adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=F, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. So (1,6) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,7) is a mine, that's 1, so (1,6) is correct. But (1,7) is 1. (1,7) is at (1,7), adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,6)=1, (0,7)=F, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. So (1,7) is 1, which would mean 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,7) is a mine, then that's 1, which matches. So maybe (0,7) is a correct flag (since the 1s around it are satisfied by that flag). But the score is 1\/11, so only one flag is correct. So maybe (0,7) is the correct one, and the others are wrong.\n\nBut how to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if a cell is 0, all 8 surrounding cells are safe, so any '?' adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's check row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row 2 is all 0s. Let's take (2,0), which is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). Let's check those cells. (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0, (2,1) is 0, (3,0) is 0, (3,1) is 0. So (2,0) being 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, which they are (all 0s). So maybe look for a '?' adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 0, column 17: '?'. What's around it? The cell to the left is (0,16) which is 1. (0,16) is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,16) adjacent cells: (0,15), (0,17), (1,15), (1,16), (1,17). (0,15) is 0, (0,17) is '?', (1,15) is 0, (1,16) is 1, (1,17) is 1. So (0,16) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,17) is a mine, that's 1. But (1,16) is 1. (1,16) adjacent cells: (0,15), (0,16), (0,17), (1,15), (1,17), (2,15), (2,16), (2,17). (0,15)=0, (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,17)=1, (2,15)=0, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0. So (1,16) has 1 mine, which could be (0,17). (1,17) is 1. (1,17) adjacent cells: (0,16), (0,17), (0,18), (1,16), (1,18), (2,16), (2,17), (2,18). (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (0,18)=?, (1,16)=1, (1,18)=1, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0, (2,18)=0. So (1,17) has 1 mine. If (0,17) is a mine, that's 1. But (0,18) is also '?', so maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell with a number that has more '?' adjacent than the number, meaning some are safe. For example, row 12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The cell (12,8) is '?'. Let's check the cell to the right, (12,9) which is 2. (12,9) is 2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (12,9): (11,8), (11,9), (11,10), (12,8), (12,10), (13,8), (13,9), (13,10). (11,8) is 1 (row 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (11,8)=1), (11,9)=2, (11,10)='?', (12,8)='?', (12,10)=1, (13,8)=1 (row 13: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (13,8)=1), (13,9)=1, (13,10)=0. So (12,9) has 2 mines. The unknowns here are (11,10), (12,8). Let's see (11,9) is 2 (row 11, column 9 is 2). (11,9) adjacent cells: (10,8), (10,9), (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9), (12,10). (10,8)=0 (row 10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (10,8)=0), (10,9)=1, (10,10)=1, (11,8)=1, (11,10)='?', (12,8)='?', (12,9)=2, (12,10)=1. So (11,9) is 2, meaning 2 mines in adjacent cells. The known cells here are (10,9)=1, (10,10)=1, (11,8)=1, (12,10)=1. Those are all 1s, not mines. So the mines must be in (11,10) and\/or (12,8). Since (12,9) is 2, which also needs 2 mines in (11,10), (12,8), etc. So (11,9) and (12,9) both need 2 mines in the same two cells. So (11,10) and (12,8) must both be mines. But that's just a possibility. \n\nAlternatively, let's find a '?' that's adjacent to a 1 where there's only one possible mine. For example, row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Column 8 is 1. (8,8) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), (8,7), (8,9), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). (7,7)=0 (row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (7,7)=0), (7,8)=1, (7,9)='?', (8,7)=0, (8,9)=1, (9,7)=0 (row 9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"), (9,8)=0, (9,9)=0. So (8,8) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (7,9)='?'. So (7,9) must be a mine! Because all other adjacent cells are 0 or 1 (which are safe, since 1 is a number, not a mine). Wait, numbers are safe cells, only mines are hidden. So the adjacent cells that are numbers (like (7,8)=1) are safe. So (8,8) is 1, meaning exactly one of its 8 adjacent cells is a mine. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,7): 0 (safe)\n(7,8): 1 (safe)\n(7,9): ? (unknown)\n(8,7): 0 (safe)\n(8,9): 1 (safe)\n(9,7): 0 (safe)\n(9,8): 0 (safe)\n(9,9): 0 (safe)\n\nSo the only unknown is (7,9). Therefore, (7,9) must be the mine. So we should flag (7,9). But wait, the current flags are 11, and only 1 is correct. If we flag (7,9), that's a new flag, but maybe (7,9) is a mine. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's confirm.\n\nThe cell (8,8) is 1. That means in the 8 surrounding cells, there's exactly 1 mine. All the surrounding cells except (7,9) are uncovered and are numbers (0 or 1), which are safe (not mines). Therefore, the only possible mine is (7,9). So (7,9) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (7,9). But the current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. Since (7,9) is a '?', and it's a mine, we should flag it. But let's check if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another cell. Let's take row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (7,9) is '?'. The cell to the left is (7,8)=1. (7,8) is 1, adjacent cells are (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,7)=0 (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (6,7)=0), (6,8)=1, (6,9)=2, (7,7)=0, (7,9)='?', (8,7)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1. So (7,8) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (6,9)=2 (which is a number, safe), (7,9)='?'. So (7,8) has 1 mine, which must be (7,9). Because (6,9) is 2, which is a safe cell (shows adjacent mine count), not a mine. So yes, (7,9) must be a mine. Therefore, the correct action is to flag (7,9).\n\n\n\nAnswer: flag (7,9)","flag (7,9)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the game rules. The board is 9x9, but looking at the provided current board, it's actually 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Wait, no, the user probably pasted the board incorrectly, maybe each line is a row, but 19 rows? That can't be right. Oh, maybe it's a typo. Let me check again. The Minesweeper game is 9x9, so there should be 9 rows. The current board listed has 19 rows, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a formatting error, and each row is separated by spaces. Let's assume that maybe each line is a row, but that's 19 rows, which is incorrect. Hmm, maybe the numbers are separated by spaces, and each row has 19 cells? That would be a 19x19 board, but the rules say 9x9. This is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces. Let's count the columns in the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 19 cells. So maybe the board is 19x19, but the rules said 9x9. Maybe that's a mistake, but I'll proceed with the given board.\n\nThe goal is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The score is 0.1818, which is 2\/11, meaning 2 correct flags out of 11 flagged. The total mines are 10, so 11 flags is over the total mines, so some flags are incorrect. The user needs to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100th epoch or uncovering a mine.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's look for cells marked with '?', which are unknown. We need to find cells that are safe to uncover or must be mines.\n\nLet's take a row and look for clues. For example, let's look at row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". The 'F' here is a flagged cell. The cell to the right of F is 1, so the F is adjacent to a 1. Let's check the 1 at (0,6) (assuming rows and cols start at 0). The cell (0,6) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,6) would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, (0,7) is F (flagged), (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1. So the 1 at (0,6) has adjacent cells. If (0,7) is a flag, then that could be the mine contributing to the 1. So maybe (0,7) is a correct flag, but since total mines are 10, and there are 11 flags, one is wrong.\n\nLooking at row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The F is at (7,9). The cell (7,8) is 1, (7,10) is 1. So (7,9) is adjacent to (7,8)=1 and (7,10)=1. The 1 at (7,8) has adjacent cells: (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,7) is 0, (6,8) is 0, (6,9) is 2, (7,7) is 0, (7,9) is F, (8,7) is 0, (8,8) is 1, (8,9) is 1. So the 1 at (7,8) has one mine in adjacent cells. If (7,9) is a mine (flagged), that would account for the 1. Similarly, (7,10) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (6,9)=2, (6,10)=2, (6,11)=1, (7,9)=F, (7,11)=0, (8,9)=1, (8,10)=1, (8,11)=0. So (7,10)=1 might have (7,9) as the mine. So (7,9) F could be a correct flag.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells. For example, row 0 has two '?' at (0,17) and (0,18). Let's check the 1 at (0,16) which is 1. The cell (0,16)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,15)=0, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=1, (1,17)=1. So (0,16)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 could be from (0,17) or (1,17). But (1,17)=1, which is a number, so it's uncovered. The 1 at (1,17) has adjacent cells. Let's check (1,17)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (0,18)=?, (1,16)=1, (1,18)=1, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0, (2,18)=0. So (1,17)=1 has two '?' cells. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. If (0,17) or (0,18) is a mine, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (4,6). The cell (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1. Let's check (4,5)=1: adjacent cells are (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So (4,5)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 here could be from (4,6) or (3,6) or (5,6). But (3,6)=1 is a number, so it's safe. (5,6)=1 is a number, safe. So (4,5)=1's mine could be (4,6). Similarly, (4,7)=1: adjacent cells (3,6)=1, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=0, (4,6)=?, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0. So (4,7)=1's mine could also be (4,6). So if (4,6) is a mine, it would satisfy both (4,5)=1 and (4,7)=1. But wait, (4,5)=1 and (4,7)=1 each need 1 mine. If (4,6) is a mine, then both would have that mine as adjacent, so each would count 1. That works. So (4,6) might be a mine. But it's currently '?', so maybe we should flag it. But wait, the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10 mines, so some flags are wrong. Let's check other '?' cells.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (5,10). Let's check (5,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,8)=0, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,10)=?, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=2, (6,10)=2. So (5,9)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. (5,10) is a '?', (4,10)=1 is a number, (6,9)=2 is a number. So (5,9)=1's mine could be (5,10). Also, (5,11)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1, (4,12)=0, (5,10)=?, (5,12)=0, (6,10)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=0. So (5,11)=1 also needs 1 mine, which could be (5,10). So (5,10) is adjacent to two 1s, so if it's a mine, both 1s are satisfied. That's a possible mine.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (8,12). (8,11)=1, (8,13)=1. (8,11)=1's adjacent cells: (7,10)=1, (7,11)=0, (7,12)=0, (8,10)=1, (8,12)=?, (9,10)=0, (9,11)=1, (9,12)=1. So (8,11)=1 needs 1 mine. (8,12) could be that mine. (8,13)=1's adjacent cells: (7,12)=0, (7,13)=0, (7,14)=0, (8,12)=?, (8,14)=0, (9,12)=1, (9,13)=1, (9,14)=0. So (8,13)=1 also needs 1 mine, which could be (8,12). So (8,12) is a possible mine.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (9,12). Similar to row 8. (9,11)=1, (9,13)=1. (9,11)=1's adjacent cells include (8,10)=1, (8,11)=1, (8,12)=?, (9,10)=1, (9,12)=?, (10,10)=0, (10,11)=1, (10,12)=1. So (9,11)=1 needs 1 mine. If (9,12) is a mine, that could be it. (9,13)=1's adjacent cells include (8,12)=?, (8,13)=1, (8,14)=0, (9,12)=?, (9,14)=0, (10,12)=1, (10,13)=1, (10,14)=0. So (9,13)=1 could also have (9,12) as a mine.\n\nRow 12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (12,8). Let's check (12,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (11,6)=0, (11,7)=1, (11,8)=1, (12,6)=0, (12,8)=?, (13,6)=0, (13,7)=1, (13,8)=1. So (12,7)=1 needs 1 mine. (12,8) could be that mine. (12,9)=2: adjacent cells include (11,8)=1, (11,9)=2, (11,10)=?, (12,8)=?, (12,10)=1, (13,8)=1, (13,9)=1, (13,10)=0. So (12,9)=2 has two '?' cells (12,8 and 11,10). If (12,8) is a mine, that contributes 1 to the 2.\n\nRow 13: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (13,0) and (13,4). Let's check (13,1)=1. Adjacent cells: (12,0)=1, (12,1)=1, (12,2)=0, (13,0)=?, (13,2)=0, (14,0)=1, (14,1)=1, (14,2)=0. So (13,1)=1 needs 1 mine. (13,0) could be that mine. (13,5)=1: adjacent cells (12,4)=1, (12,5)=1, (12,6)=0, (13,4)=?, (13,6)=0, (14,4)=1, (14,5)=1, (14,6)=0. So (13,5)=1 needs 1 mine, which could be (13,4).\n\nRow 15: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (15,10). (15,9)=1, (15,11)=1. (15,9)=1's adjacent cells: (14,8)=0, (14,9)=1, (14,10)=1, (15,8)=0, (15,10)=?, (16,8)=0, (16,9)=1, (16,10)=2. So (15,9)=1 needs 1 mine, which could be (15,10). (15,11)=1's adjacent cells: (14,10)=1, (14,11)=1, (14,12)=0, (15,10)=?, (15,12)=0, (16,10)=2, (16,11)=2, (16,12)=1. So (15,11)=1 could also have (15,10) as a mine.\n\nRow 16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Let's check (16,10)=2. Adjacent cells: (15,9)=1, (15,10)=?, (15,11)=1, (16,9)=1, (16,11)=2, (17,9)=0, (17,10)=1, (17,11)=?. So (16,10)=2 has two '?' cells (15,10 and 17,11). If (15,10) is a mine, that's 1, and maybe (17,11) is another.\n\nRow 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (17,11). (17,10)=1, (17,12)=1. (17,10)=1's adjacent cells: (16,9)=1, (16,10)=2, (16,11)=2, (17,9)=0, (17,11)=?, (18,9)=0, (18,10)=1, (18,11)=?. So (17,10)=1 needs 1 mine. (17,11) could be that mine. (17,12)=1's adjacent cells: (16,11)=2, (16,12)=1, (16,13)=0, (17,11)=?, (17,13)=0, (18,11)=?, (18,12)=1, (18,13)=0. So (17,12)=1 could also have (17,11) as a mine.\n\nRow 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". '?' at (18,11). (18,10)=1, (18,12)=1. (18,10)=1's adjacent cells: (17,9)=0, (17,10)=1, (17,11)=?, (18,9)=0, (18,11)=?, (19,9)=0, (19,10)=0, (19,11)=0. Assuming row 19 exists, but maybe not. So (18,10)=1 needs 1 mine, which could be (18,11). (18,12)=1's adjacent cells: (17,11)=?, (17,12)=1, (17,13)=0, (18,11)=?, (18,13)=0, (19,11)=0, (19,12)=0, (19,13)=0. So (18,12)=1 could also have (18,11) as a mine.\n\nNow, the user has 11 flags, but there are only 10 mines. So one of the flags is incorrect. Let's check the existing flags. The current board has 'F's at (0,7) and (7,9) (assuming rows start at 0 and cols start at 0). Let's check (0,7) F. The cell (0,6) is 1. Adjacent to (0,7) are (0,6)=1, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1. The 1 at (0,6) has adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,7)=F, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. So (0,6)=1's mine could be (0,7). The 1 at (0,8)=1 has adjacent cells: (0,7)=F, (0,9)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=0. So (0,8)=1's mine could be (0,7). So if (0,7) is a mine, that's correct. Now (7,9) F. The cell (7,8)=1 has adjacent cells including (7,9)=F. (7,10)=1 also has (7,9) as adjacent. So (7,9) is likely a correct flag. So two flags, but user has 11 flags, so there are 9 more flags not shown here? Maybe the board display is truncated.\n\nBut the main point is to find a cell to uncover that is safe. Let's look for cells with 0, which mean all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0 has multiple 0s. Let's take (0,0)=0. All adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) should be safe and can be uncovered, but they are already 0. So 0 cells are already uncovered.\n\nLooking for cells with numbers that have all adjacent mines accounted for, so the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, if a cell is 1 and has one adjacent flag, then the other adjacent cells are safe. Let's take (0,6)=1. Adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=F, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. So (0,6)=1 has one flag (F) adjacent, which is (0,7). So that accounts for the 1. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (0,5, 1,5, etc.) are safe. But those are already 0, so nothing to uncover there.\n\nAnother example: (1,6)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=F, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. So (1,6)=1 has one adjacent F (0,7), which accounts for the 1. So the other adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 9: (4,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,8)=0, (3,9)=0, (3,10)=1, (4,8)=0, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,9)=1, (5,10)=?. So (4,9)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in those 8. The cell (5,10) is '?', (3,10)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,9)=1 are numbers. So maybe (4,9)=1's mine is (5,10), but that's a '?'. Alternatively, if (5,10) is not a mine, then (4,9)=1's mine must be elsewhere, but I don't see other '?' cells adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0. If a cell is adjacent to a 0, then it's safe. For example, if there's a 0 cell, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". All 0s, so all adjacent cells to row 2 are safe. Let's take (2,0)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0. All uncovered. Similarly, row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (3,5)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?. So (3,5)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The '?' is (4,6). So if (4,6) is a mine, that's the 1. But if (3,5)=1's mine is (4,6), then (4,6) is a mine. But maybe (3,5)=1's mine is elsewhere. But (2,4-6) are 0s, so no mines there. (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1 (uncovered). So the only possible mine is (4,6). So (4,6) must be a mine. Therefore, (4,6) should be flagged. But the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10, so maybe some existing flags are wrong. But the user's current flags are 2\/11 correct, so 9 incorrect flags. So maybe some of the existing 'F's are wrong, and we need to unflag them. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a number that has already has all its mines accounted for. Let's take (12,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (11,0)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=0, (12,1)=1, (13,0)=?, (13,1)=1, (13,2)=0. (12,0)=1 has two '?' cells: (11,0) and (13,0). If (13,1)=1, which is adjacent to (13,0)=?, (12,0)=1, (12,1)=1, etc. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: since the user's score is 2\/11, they have 2 correct flags and 9 incorrect. To improve the score, they should unflag the incorrect flags. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet. However, the problem requires outputting an action, which could be uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that is a '?' and is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 2 is all 0s. Let's check (2,18)=0 (assuming row 2 has 19 cells). Adjacent cells would be (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1, (2,17)=0, (2,19) (if exists), (3,17)=0, (3,18)=0. So (2,18)=0's adjacent cells are (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1, (2,17)=0, (3,17)=0, (3,18)=0. All uncovered except maybe (1,17) and (1,18) which are 1s. So no '?' there.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 14: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (14,8)=0. Adjacent cells: (13,7)=1, (13,8)=1, (13,9)=1, (14,7)=0, (14,9)=1, (15,7)=0, (15,8)=0, (15,9)=1. So (14,8)=0 is safe, and all adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to find a '?' cell that is likely safe. For example, let's look at (0,17)=? in row 0. The cell (0,16)=1. Adjacent to (0,17) are (0,16)=1, (0,18)=?, (1,16)=1, (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1. (1,17)=1: adjacent cells are (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (0,18)=?, (1,16)=1, (1,18)=1, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0, (2,18)=0. (1,17)=1 has two '?' cells. Since (2,16-18) are 0s, no mines there. So the 1 at (1,17) must have one mine in (0,17) or (0,18). Similarly, (0,16)=1 has adjacent cells (0,15)=0, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=1, (1,17)=1. So (0,16)=1's mine is either (0,17) or (1,17). But (1,17)=1 is a number, so not a mine. So (0,16)=1's mine is (0,17). Therefore, (0,17) is a mine. So we should flag (0,17). But the user already has 11 flags, so maybe they have a wrong flag elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe (0,17) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the user's current flags are 2 correct out of 11. So 9 flags are incorrect. To maximize the score, they should unflag the incorrect ones. But which ones? For example, if a flagged cell is adjacent to a 0, it's definitely incorrect. Because a 0 means no adjacent mines. So if there's an 'F' adjacent to a 0, that's a wrong flag. Let's check the existing 'F's. The first 'F' is at (0,7). Adjacent cells: (0,6)=1, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1. None of these are 0, so (0,7) could be a mine. The other 'F' is at (7,9). Adjacent cells: (7,8)=1, (7,10)=1, (6,8)=0, (6,9)=2, (6,10)=2, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1, (8,10)=1. (6,8)=0 is adjacent to (7,9)=F. Oh! (6,8)=0 means there are no mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (6,8)=0 include (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,9)=1, (6,7)=0, (6,9)=2, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=F. So (6,8)=0 has (7,9)=F as an adjacent cell. But (6,8)=0 means no mines in adjacent cells, so (7,9) cannot be a mine. Therefore, (7,9) is an incorrect flag! That's one of the 9 incorrect flags. So the user should unflag (7,9).\n\nYes! That's a key insight. (6,8) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells must be safe (no mines). One of those adjacent cells is (7,9), which is flagged (F). Since (6,8)=0, (7,9) cannot be a mine. Therefore, (7,9) is an incorrect flag and should be unflagged.\n\nSo the action should be to unflag (7,9).\n\nAnswer: unflag (7,9)","unflag (7,9)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user mentioned the board is 9x9, but the current board displayed has 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Oh, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers are the cells. Let me check the input again. The Current Board has 19 lines, each with 19 characters? That can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be a 9x9 grid. Or perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the board. But regardless, I need to focus on the given board.\n\nThe user's goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags divided by total mines (10). Currently, Flags are 1\/11, which means 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged cells. Unflags are 1, so they unflagged once.\n\nLooking at the board, let's parse a row. For example, the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – each cell is separated by a space. The characters are 0, 1, F, ?, etc. The 'F' is a flagged cell. The '?' are unknown.\n\nThe key is to find cells that are safe to uncover (i.e., not mines) or to flag mines correctly. Let's look for cells where the number of adjacent flags matches the number, which would mean the remaining adjacent '?' are safe to uncover.\n\nFor example, take a cell with a number, say a '1' that has one adjacent 'F' and the rest '?'. Then the '?' would be safe. Alternatively, if a cell has a number equal to the number of adjacent '?', those '?' must be mines and should be flagged.\n\nLooking at the 5th row (index 4, since rows start at 0): \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Let's index columns from 0. So row 4, column 6 is '?'. The adjacent cells to (4,6): let's check the numbers around it. The cell to the left is (4,5) which is '1', and to the right is (4,7) which is '1'. Also, the cells above and below. Let's check row 3, column 6: row 3 is \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so (3,6) is '1'. Row 5, column 6: row 5 is \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so (5,6) is '1'. So (4,6) is surrounded by (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (3,6)=1, (5,6)=1. Let's see if any of these numbers can help.\n\nTake (4,5) which is '1'. The adjacent cells to (4,5) are: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Let's list their current states. (3,4) is 0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So the '1' at (4,5) has adjacent cells. The number 1 means there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. The current known mines (flags) in those adjacent cells: are there any F's? Let's check. The first row has an F at column 7. Let's check other rows. For example, row 0, column 7 is F. So (0,7) is flagged.\n\nSo (4,5) has adjacent cells, none of which are F (since (4,6) is '?', others are numbers or 0). So the '1' at (4,5) must have 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which includes (4,6). So if (4,5) has 1 mine, and (4,6) is a candidate, maybe (4,6) is a mine? But let's check another cell.\n\nTake (4,7) which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1 (row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0...\", so (3,7)=1), (3,8)=0 (row 3, column 8 is 0). (4,6)=?, (4,8)=0. (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0...\", (5,7)=1), (5,8)=0. So the '1' at (4,7) has adjacent cells. Again, no F's here. So (4,7) also has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which includes (4,6). So (4,6) is adjacent to two '1's. If (4,6) were a mine, then both (4,5) and (4,7) would have that mine as their only adjacent mine, which fits. So (4,6) might be a mine. But maybe not. Let's check another cell.\n\nLooking at row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row 7, column 9 is '?'. Let's check the cell to the left, (7,8)=1, and to the right (7,10)=1. The cell (7,8)=1: adjacent cells include (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,7)=0 (row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1...\", (6,7)=0), (6,8)=1 (row 6, column 8=1), (6,9)=2 (row 6, column 9=2), (7,7)=0, (7,9)=?, (8,7)=0 (row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0...\", (8,7)=0), (8,8)=1 (row 8, column 8=1), (8,9)=1 (row 8, column 9=1). So (7,8)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 here means 1 mine in those 8. The (7,9) is a '?', which is adjacent. If (7,9) is a mine, that would satisfy the 1 at (7,8). Then, the cell (7,10)=1: adjacent cells include (6,9), (6,10), (6,11), (7,9), (7,11), (8,9), (8,10), (8,11). (6,9)=2, (6,10)=2, (6,11)=1, (7,9)=?, (7,11)=0, (8,9)=1, (8,10)=1, (8,11)=0. So (7,10)=1's adjacent cells. If (7,9) is a mine, then (7,10) would have that mine as one, but does that fit? The 1 at (7,10) would need exactly 1 mine. If (7,9) is a mine, then that's 1, so that works. So (7,9) could be a mine. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, a cell with a number that has all adjacent flags equal to the number, so the remaining '?' are safe. Let's check row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". So (0,7) is F (flagged). The cell (0,6)=1. Adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=F, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. So (0,6) is 1, and has one adjacent F (0,7). So the 1 at (0,6) is satisfied because there's 1 mine (the F). That means the other adjacent cells (like (1,6) and (1,7)) are safe. So (1,6) and (1,7) are already uncovered as 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: row 12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (12,8) is '?'. The cell to the left is (12,7)=1. Adjacent cells to (12,7) are (11,6), (11,7), (11,8), (12,6), (12,8), (13,6), (13,7), (13,8). Let's check their states. (11,6)=0 (row 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1...\", (11,6)=0), (11,7)=1 (row 11, column7=1), (11,8)=1 (row 11, column8=1), (12,6)=0, (12,8)=?, (13,6)=0 (row 13: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0...\", (13,6)=0), (13,7)=1 (row13, column7=1), (13,8)=1 (row13, column8=1). So (12,7)=1's adjacent cells. The 1 here means 1 mine in those 8. Currently, no F's here. So (12,8) is a '?', which is adjacent. If (12,8) is a mine, that would make the 1 at (12,7) correct. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '0' cell. A '0' means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent '?' can be uncovered safely. For example, row 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". All cells here are 0, so any adjacent '?' to these 0s can be uncovered. Let's check row 2, column 0: (2,0)=0. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). Let's check those cells. Row 1, column0=0, row1, column1=0, row2, column1=0, row3, column0=0, row3, column1=0. So all adjacent are 0, so no mines. But row 2 is all 0s, so any cells adjacent to row 2 that are '?' can be uncovered. Let's check row 1, column 18 (last column): row1 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\". So row1, column18=1. Row 2, column18=0 (row2 is all 0s). So (2,18)=0. Adjacent cells to (2,18) are (1,17), (1,18), (3,17), (3,18). (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1, (3,17)=0 (row3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", column17=0), (3,18)=0. So (2,18)=0, which means no mines in those adjacent cells, so (1,17) and (1,18) are 1s, which are safe.\n\nAnother approach: since the game ends at 100 epochs, but we need to maximize the score (correct flags \/ 10). Currently, there's 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged. So maybe some of the flagged cells are incorrect. The user might have flagged 11 cells, but only 1 is a mine. So unflagging incorrect flags could help, but the user already has 1 unflag. But the problem is to choose the next action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nLooking for a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0 has \"1 ? ?\" at the end (columns 17 and 18). The cell (0,16)=1. Let's check (0,16)=1's adjacent cells: (0,15)=0, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=1, (1,17)=1. The 1 at (0,16) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,17), (1,16), (1,17). (1,16)=1 (uncovered), (1,17)=1 (uncovered). So the mine must be (0,17) or (0,18). But (0,17) is '?', (0,18) is '?'. So (0,16)=1 has two '?' adjacent. Maybe not helpful.\n\nRow 13: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The cell (13,2)=0. Adjacent cells to (13,2) are (12,1), (12,2), (12,3), (13,1), (13,3), (14,1), (14,2), (14,3). Let's check those. (12,1)=1 (row12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1...\"), (12,2)=0, (12,3)=1, (13,1)=1, (13,3)=1, (14,1)=1 (row14: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0...\"), (14,2)=0, (14,3)=1. So (13,2)=0 means no mines in those 8 cells, so all adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, the '?' in row13, column0 (13,0) and row13, column4 (13,4) are adjacent to (13,2)=0? Let's see: (13,0) is adjacent to (12,0)=1 (row12, column0=1), (12,1)=1, (13,1)=1. (13,0) is '?', but (13,2)=0 is two columns away, so not adjacent. So (13,0) is not adjacent to (13,2). The cell (13,4) is '?', adjacent to (12,3)=1, (12,4)=1, (12,5)=1, (13,3)=1, (13,5)=1, (14,3)=1, (14,4)=1, (14,5)=1. So (13,4) is surrounded by 1s. Not sure.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell that has adjacent '?'. For example, row 2 is all 0s. Let's take (2,0)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0. All are uncovered, so no '?' there. How about row 2, column 5: (2,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (1,4)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1. So (2,5)=0's adjacent cells are mostly 0s and 1s, no '?'. \n\nRow 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". All cells here are 0 or 1, no '?'. \n\nRow 4 has a '?' at (4,6). Let's check (4,6)'s adjacent cells: (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. So (4,6) is surrounded by 1s. Each of these 1s has (4,6) as an adjacent cell. For example, (3,6)=1: adjacent cells are (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1. So (3,6)=1 has 8 adjacent cells, of which 7 are uncovered (0 or 1) and 1 is '?'. So the 1 at (3,6) must have exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Since all the other adjacent cells are uncovered (and thus safe, as they are numbers or 0), the only possible mine is (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) must be a mine! Because if (3,6)=1, and all adjacent cells except (4,6) are safe (since they are uncovered and not mines), then (4,6) must be the mine. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's verify: (3,6) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=0 (safe), (2,7)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe, since it's uncovered), (3,7)=1 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (4,7)=1 (safe), and (4,6)=? (unknown). Since 1 mine is needed, and all others are safe, (4,6) must be the mine. Therefore, (4,6) is a mine and should be flagged. But wait, the current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. But maybe I need to uncover a safe cell. Alternatively, maybe there's a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nWait, let's take another example. Let's look at row 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (17,11) is '?'. The cell (17,10)=1 and (17,12)=1. Let's check (17,10)=1's adjacent cells: (16,9)=1, (16,10)=2, (16,11)=2, (17,9)=0, (17,11)=?, (18,9)=0, (18,10)=1, (18,11)=?. So (17,10)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 here means 1 mine. The adjacent cells include (17,11)=? and (16,10)=2, (16,11)=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is a number, and the number of adjacent '?' equals the number. For example, if a cell is '2' and has two adjacent '?', then those '?' are mines. But let's check row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (6,9)=2 and (6,10)=2. Let's take (6,9)=2. Adjacent cells: (5,8)=0, (5,9)=1, (5,10)=?, (6,8)=1, (6,10)=2, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=?, (7,10)=1. So (6,9)=2's adjacent cells: (5,10)=?, (7,9)=?, and others are numbers. So two '?'. Since (6,9)=2, those two '?' must be mines. Therefore, (5,10) and (7,9) are mines. Let's check (5,10): row 5 is \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so (5,10)=? which is one of the '?'. (7,9)=? (row7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0...\"). So (5,10) and (7,9) are adjacent to (6,9)=2. Since (6,9)=2, and there are two '?' adjacent, those must be mines. Therefore, (5,10) and (7,9) are mines and should be flagged. \n\nSimilarly, (6,10)=2. Adjacent cells: (5,9)=1, (5,10)=?, (5,11)=1, (6,9)=2, (6,11)=1, (7,9)=?, (7,10)=1, (7,11)=0. So (6,10)=2 has two '?' adjacent: (5,10) and (7,9). So again, those must be mines. That confirms it: (5,10) and (7,9) are mines.\n\nNow, let's check another cell. Row 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (11,10)=?. Let's check (11,9)=2. Adjacent cells to (11,9)=2: (10,8)=0, (10,9)=1, (10,10)=1, (11,8)=1, (11,10)=?, (12,8)=?, (12,9)=2, (12,10)=1. So (11,9)=2 has two '?' adjacent: (11,10) and (12,8). So if (11,9)=2, then those two '?' must be mines. Let's check (12,8)=? (row12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1...\"), yes, (12,8)=? is adjacent. So (11,10) and (12,8) are mines.\n\nRow 15: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (15,10)=?. Let's check (15,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (14,8)=0, (14,9)=1, (14,10)=1, (15,8)=0, (15,10)=?, (16,8)=0, (16,9)=1, (16,10)=2. So (15,9)=1 has one '?' adjacent: (15,10). So (15,10) must be a mine.\n\nRow 16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (16,10)=2. Adjacent cells: (15,9)=1, (15,10)=?, (15,11)=1, (16,9)=1, (16,11)=2, (17,9)=0, (17,10)=1, (17,11)=?. So (16,10)=2 has two '?' adjacent: (15,10) and (17,11). Since (15,10) is already determined to be a mine (from (15,9)=1), then (17,11)=? must be the other mine to satisfy (16,10)=2.\n\nRow 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (17,11)=? which we just said is a mine.\n\nRow 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (18,11)=?. Let's check (18,10)=1. Adjacent cells: (17,9)=0, (17,10)=1, (17,11)=?, (18,9)=0, (18,11)=?, (19,9)=0 (but row 18 is the last row?), (19,10)=0, (19,11)=0. Assuming rows are 0-18 (19 rows), but the original game is 9x9. Maybe the board is misformatted, but let's proceed. (18,10)=1 has two '?' adjacent: (17,11) and (18,11). Since (17,11) is a mine (from (16,10)=2), then (18,11) can't be a mine (because (18,10)=1 needs only 1 mine). So (18,11) is safe. Therefore, (18,11) can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, let's get back. The user needs to either uncover a safe cell or flag a mine. Since the current score is 1\/10 (0.0909), they need to flag more correct mines. From the earlier analysis, (4,6) is a mine (from (3,6)=1), (5,10), (7,9), (11,10), (12,8), (15,10), (17,11) are mines. That's 7 mines. There are 10 total, so need to find 3 more. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 2 is all 0s, so any cell adjacent to row 2 that is '?' is safe. Let's check row 2, column 7: (2,7)=0. Adjacent cells: (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=0. All are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nAnother 0 cell: row 4, column 4=0. Adjacent cells: (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. All are uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is not adjacent to any numbers, which would mean it's a 0 and can be uncovered. For example, row 9: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – all 0s. The cells around row 9 might be safe. But row 9, column 0=0. Adjacent cells: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (9,1)=0, (10,0)=0, (10,1)=0. All uncovered.\n\nMaybe the best approach is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, meaning it's safe. Let's check row 14: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The cell (14,8)=0. Adjacent cells: (13,7)=1, (13,8)=1, (13,9)=1, (14,7)=0, (14,9)=1, (15,7)=0, (15,8)=0, (15,9)=1. All are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (10,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (9,8)=0, (9,9)=0, (9,10)=0, (10,8)=0, (10,10)=1, (11,8)=1, (11,9)=2, (11,10)=?. So (10,9)=1 has one '?' adjacent: (11,10). So (11,10) is a mine (as before).\n\nGiven that, perhaps the safest move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0 has \"1 ? ?\" at columns 17 and 18. The cell (0,16)=1. The cell (1,16)=1 (row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\"). (1,16)=1's adjacent cells: (0,15)=0, (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,17)=1, (2,15)=0, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0. So (1,16)=1 has adjacent cells (0,17)=? and (1,17)=1. The 1 at (1,16) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (1,17)=1 is uncovered, so safe. (0,17)=? is the only possible mine. So (0,17) is a mine, and (0,18)=? is adjacent to (0,17)=? and (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1. (0,18)=? is adjacent to (0,17)=?, (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1. Since (1,18)=1 has adjacent cells (0,17)=?, (0,18)=?, (1,17)=1, (2,17)=0, (2,18)=0. (1,18)=1 needs 1 mine. If (0,17) is a mine, then (1,18)=1's mine is (0,17), so (0,18)=? is safe. Therefore, (0,18) can be uncovered safely.\n\nSo the action would be to uncover (0,18).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,18)","uncover (0,18)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the game rules. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, the user probably pasted the board with each row separated, but maybe each line is a row. Let's count: the Current Board section has 19 lines, each with 19 elements. Wait, 9x9 grid should be 9 rows and 9 columns. Hmm, maybe the input here is a mistake, but perhaps it's a typo and it's a 19x19 grid? Or maybe the user made a formatting error. But regardless, I need to focus on the rules and the current state.\n\nThe score is 0.0909, which is 1\/11, meaning 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged (since total mines are 10). The flags are 1\/11, so there are 11 flags placed, but only 1 is correct. Unflags are 1, so they unflagged once.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags \/ total mines (10). So the current score is 1\/11, but that's probably a display of correct flags over total flags (1\/11), but the actual score is 1\/10. Maybe the user's note says \"Flags: 1\/11\" meaning 1 correct out of 11 flagged. So there are 11 F's on the board, but only 1 is a mine.\n\nLooking at the Current Board, I need to find cells that are either safe to uncover (i.e., known to be safe) or need to be flagged (known to be mines). Let's look for cells marked with '?', which are unknown. The task is to decide whether to uncover a '?', flag a '?', or unflag an 'F' (but since unflags are 1, maybe some F's are incorrect).\n\nFirst, let's look for numbered cells that can help deduce mine positions. For example, a cell with a number indicates the count of mines in adjacent cells. If a numbered cell has adjacent '?' and 'F's, we can check if the count matches.\n\nLet's take an example row. Let's pick row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1\". The 'F' here is at (0,7). Let's check the number at (0,6) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (0,6) (row 0, column 6) would be the 8 surrounding cells. (0,6) is 1, so there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are: (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, (0,7) is F, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1. So (0,6) has an F at (0,7). Since the number is 1, that F could be the mine. So maybe (0,7) is a correct flag. But the score says 1 correct flag, so maybe that's the one.\n\nAnother example: row 4: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' here is at (4,6). Let's check the number at (4,5) which is 1. (4,5) is at row 4, column 5. Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,4) is 0, (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,6) is ?, (5,4) is 0, (5,5) is 1, (5,6) is 1. The number at (4,5) is 1, so there should be 1 mine in these 8 cells. The adjacent cells with numbers or ?. The '?' at (4,6) is adjacent. If (4,5) is 1, maybe (4,6) is a mine? But wait, (4,7) is 1. Let's check (4,7) which is 1. Adjacent cells to (4,7): (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6) is 1, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 0, (4,6) is ?, (4,8) is 0, (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 0. So (4,7) is 1, meaning 1 mine in adjacent cells. The '?' at (4,6) is adjacent here. If (4,6) is a mine, then (4,7) would have 1 mine (from (4,6)), which fits. Also, (4,5) is 1, so if (4,6) is a mine, then (4,5) has 1 mine, which fits. So (4,6) might be a mine. But we need to check other cells.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (5,10). Let's check (5,9) which is 1. Adjacent cells to (5,9): (4,8), (4,9), (4,10), (5,8), (5,10), (6,8), (6,9), (6,10). (4,8) is 0, (4,9) is 1, (4,10) is 1, (5,8) is 0, (5,10) is ?, (6,8) is 1, (6,9) is 2, (6,10) is 2. So (5,9) is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. The '?' at (5,10) is adjacent. (6,9) is 2. Let's check (6,9): adjacent cells. (5,8), (5,9), (5,10), (6,8), (6,10), (7,8), (7,9), (7,10). (5,8)=0, (5,9)=1, (5,10)=?, (6,8)=1, (6,10)=2, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=?, (7,10)=1. (6,9) is 2, so 2 mines in adjacent. If (5,10) is a mine, then (6,9) would have that as one mine. Maybe (7,9) is another mine? Let's check row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (7,9). (7,8) is 1. Adjacent to (7,8): (6,7), (6,8), (6,9), (7,7), (7,9), (8,7), (8,8), (8,9). (6,7)=0, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=2, (7,7)=0, (7,9)=?, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1. (7,8) is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent. (7,9) is adjacent, so if (7,9) is a mine, that fits. Then (6,9) would have (5,10) and (7,9) as mines, making 2, which matches (6,9)=2. That's a possible scenario.\n\nAnother '?' in row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" – no '?'. Row 2: all 0s. Row 3: no '?'. Row 4: '?' at (4,6). Row 5: '?' at (5,10). Row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – no '?'. Row 7: '?' at (7,9). Row 8: no '?'. Row 9: no '?'. Row 10: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – no '?'. Row 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (11,10). Row 12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (12,8). Row 13: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (13,0) and (13,4). Row 14: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – no '?'. Row 15: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (15,10). Row 16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – no '?'. Row 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (17,11). Row 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – '?' at (18,11).\n\nThat's a lot of '?'s. Let's focus on areas where numbers can help. For example, row 12: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (12,8). Let's check (12,7) which is 1. (12,7) is row 12, column 7. Adjacent cells: (11,6), (11,7), (11,8), (12,6), (12,8), (13,6), (13,7), (13,8). (11,6)=0, (11,7)=1, (11,8)=1, (12,6)=0, (12,8)=?, (13,6)=0, (13,7)=1, (13,8)=1. So (12,7)=1 means 1 mine in adjacent. The '?' at (12,8) is adjacent. If (12,8) is a mine, that would satisfy the 1. Also, (12,9) is 2. Adjacent to (12,9): (11,8), (11,9), (11,10), (12,8), (12,10), (13,8), (13,9), (13,10). (11,8)=1, (11,9)=2, (11,10)=?, (12,8)=?, (12,10)=1, (13,8)=1, (13,9)=1, (13,10)=0. (12,9)=2, so 2 mines here. If (12,8) is a mine and (11,10) is a mine, that would make 2. But (11,10) is a '?' in row 11: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" (row 11, column 10). Let's check (11,9) which is 2. Adjacent to (11,9): (10,8), (10,9), (10,10), (11,8), (11,10), (12,8), (12,9), (12,10). (10,8)=0, (10,9)=1, (10,10)=1, (11,8)=1, (11,10)=?, (12,8)=?, (12,9)=2, (12,10)=1. (11,9)=2, so 2 mines here. If (11,10) and (12,8) are mines, that's 2, which fits. So (12,8) and (11,10) could be mines.\n\nBut maybe there's a safer cell to uncover. Let's look for cells where the number of adjacent flags plus known mines equals the number, meaning the remaining '?' are safe. For example, if a cell has number 2, and there are already 2 flags adjacent, then the other adjacent '?' are safe.\n\nAlternatively, look for 0 cells. If a cell is 0, all adjacent cells are safe, so their '?' can be uncovered. Let's check the 0 cells. For example, row 0 starts with several 0s. (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells (which are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) are 0, so those are safe. But those are already uncovered as 0. So no '?' there.\n\nAnother 0 cell: row 2 is all 0s. So any '?' adjacent to row 2's 0s would be safe. Let's check row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The 0 at (3,8). Adjacent cells include (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=1, (3,9)=0, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=0, (4,9)=1. So (3,8) is 0, which means all adjacent are safe. (4,8) is 0, which is safe. (3,9) is 0, safe. So no '?' there.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 13 has a '?' at (13,0). Let's check (13,0) adjacent cells: (12,0), (12,1), (13,1), (14,0), (14,1). (12,0)=1, (12,1)=1, (13,1)=1, (14,0)=1, (14,1)=1. None of these are 0, so (13,0) could be a mine or safe. Not helpful.\n\nAnother '?': row 13, column 4: (13,4). Adjacent cells: (12,3), (12,4), (12,5), (13,3), (13,5), (14,3), (14,4), (14,5). (12,3)=1, (12,4)=1, (12,5)=1, (13,3)=1, (13,5)=1, (14,3)=1, (14,4)=1, (14,5)=1. All are 1, so (13,4) could be a mine or safe.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 9: (7,9) '?'. Adjacent cells: (6,8), (6,9), (6,10), (7,8), (7,10), (8,8), (8,9), (8,10). (6,8)=1, (6,9)=2, (6,10)=2, (7,8)=1, (7,10)=1, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1, (8,10)=1. (7,8) is 1. (7,8) adjacent cells include (7,9). So (7,8)=1, which would mean 1 mine in adjacent. If (7,9) is a mine, then that's 1, so (7,9) is a mine. But if (7,9) is safe, then (7,8) must have a mine in another adjacent cell, but the other adjacent cells to (7,8) are (6,7)=0, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=2, (7,7)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1. None of these are F or known mines, so maybe (7,9) is the mine.\n\nBut maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe. Let's check row 0, column 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1\". The '?' is at (0,17). Let's check (0,16)=1. Adjacent to (0,16): (0,15), (0,17), (1,15), (1,16), (1,17). (0,15)=0, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=1, (1,17)=1. (0,16)=1, so 1 mine here. (1,16)=1: adjacent cells (0,15), (0,16), (0,17), (1,15), (1,17), (2,15), (2,16), (2,17). (0,15)=0, (0,16)=1, (0,17)=?, (1,15)=0, (1,17)=1, (2,15)=0, (2,16)=0, (2,17)=0. (1,16)=1, so 1 mine. The '?' at (0,17) is adjacent to both (0,16) and (1,16). If (0,17) is a mine, then (0,16) has 1 mine (good) and (1,16) has 1 mine (good). If (0,17) is safe, then both (0,16) and (1,16) would need mines elsewhere, but their other adjacent cells are 0s. So (0,17) is likely a mine. But since we have 11 flags already, and only 1 is correct, maybe some of the F's are wrong. For example, the F at (0,7): let's check if that's a correct flag. (0,6)=1, adjacent to (0,7)=F. (0,6) has 1 mine, so if (0,7) is a mine, that's correct. But (1,7)=1: adjacent cells to (1,7) are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,6)=1, (0,7)=F, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. (1,7)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent. If (0,7) is a mine, that's 1, which fits. So (0,7) is likely a correct flag (the 1 correct flag mentioned). So the other 10 F's are incorrect. So we need to unflag those, but the user might not have that info.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a '?' that is definitely safe. For example, if a numbered cell has more '?'s adjacent than the number, but some are already flagged. Wait, maybe a cell with number 0: all adjacent are safe, so any '?' adjacent to 0 can be uncovered. Let's check row 2, which is all 0s. Let's take (2,0)=0. Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). All of these are 0, so no '?'. (2,1)=0, same. (2,2)=0, adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). All 0s. So no '?'s adjacent to 0s.\n\nAnother approach: look for a '?' that is adjacent to a cell with a number equal to the number of adjacent F's. For example, if a cell has number 2 and there are 2 F's adjacent, then the remaining '?'s are safe. Let's check the F's. The current board has an F at (0,7). Let's see other F's. Wait, the current board as displayed: row 0 has \"1 F 1\", so (0,7) is F. Are there other F's? Let me check all rows. The user's Current Board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 → F at (0,7)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 → no F\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 12: 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 13: ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 14: 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 16: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → no F\n\nWait, only row 0 has an F at (0,7). But the user said \"Flags: 1\/11\", which implies there are 11 F's. So maybe the board display is truncated or formatted incorrectly. That's a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board. But given that, perhaps the only visible F is at (0,7), and the rest are not shown. Assuming that, then the 1 correct flag is (0,7), and the other 10 F's are in cells not visible here.\n\nIn that case, perhaps the best move is to uncover a '?' that is likely safe. Let's pick a '?' that is adjacent to a 1, but with other adjacent cells that are 0. For example, row 0, column 17: '?'. (0,17) is adjacent to (0,16)=1 and (0,18)=1. (0,18)=1's adjacent cells: (0,17), (1,17), (1,18). (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1. So (0,18)=1, which has adjacent cells (0,17), (1,17), (1,18). (1,17)=1, (1,18)=1. So (0,18)=1, so 1 mine in those. If (0,17) is safe, then (1,17) or (1,18) must be a mine, but they are 1, which are uncovered. So maybe (0,17) is safe. Alternatively, let's look for a '?' that is in a corner or edge with low numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, column 6: '?'. (4,6) is adjacent to (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. All adjacent cells are 1, so (4,6) could be a mine (since 8 cells with 1, so each 1 needs 1 mine, which could be (4,6)). But if (4,6) is a mine, then all those 1s are satisfied. But that's a lot of 1s around, so (4,6) is likely a mine.\n\nBut since we need to uncover a safe cell, maybe there's a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. Wait, row 13, column 0 is '?'. (13,0) is adjacent to (12,0)=1, (12,1)=1, (13,1)=1, (14,0)=1, (14,1)=1. No 0s, so not helpful.\n\nAnother '?': row 17, column 11. (17,11) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (16,10), (16,11), (16,12), (17,10), (17,12), (18,10), (18,11), (18,12). (16,10)=1, (16,11)=2, (16,12)=2, (17,10)=1, (17,12)=1, (18,10)=1, (18,11)=?, (18,12)=1. (17,10)=1: adjacent cells (16,9), (16,10), (16,11), (17,9), (17,11), (18,9), (18,10), (18,11). (16,9)=1, (16,10)=1, (16,11)=2, (17,9)=0, (17,11)=?, (18,9)=0, (18,10)=1, (18,11)=?. (17,10)=1, so 1 mine here. If (17,11) is a mine, that's 1. (16,11)=2: adjacent cells (15,10), (15,11), (15,12), (16,10), (16,12), (17,10), (17,11), (17,12). (15,10)=1, (15,11)=?, (15,12)=1, (16,10)=1, (16,12)=2, (17,10)=1, (17,11)=?, (17,12)=1. (16,11)=2, so 2 mines here. If (15,11) and (17,11) are mines, that's 2. So (17,11) could be a mine.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to pick a '?' that is in an area with many 0s, but since I can't find any, perhaps pick a '?' that is least likely to be a mine. Alternatively, since the game ends at 100 epochs, and we need to maximize the score, but the current score is 1\/10 (since 1 correct flag), maybe we need to flag more mines. But the user has 11 flags, 1 correct, so 10 incorrect. So unflagging those would help, but the user already has 1 unflag.\n\nAlternatively, uncover a '?' that's adjacent to a 1 with only one '?', meaning it's safe. For example, if a cell has number 1 and only one adjacent '?', then that '?' is a mine. But if a cell has number 1 and two adjacent '?', then one is a mine. But if a cell has number 0, all adjacent are safe.\n\nWait, let's check row 14: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The 0 at (14,7), (14,8), (14,6). (14,6)=0: adjacent cells (13,5), (13,6), (13,7), (14,5), (14,7), (15,5), (15,6), (15,7). (13,5)=1, (13,6)=0, (13,7)=1, (14,5)=1, (14,7)=0, (15,5)=0, (15,6)=0, (15,7)=0. So (14,6)=0, so all adjacent are safe. (13,6)=0, which is safe. (15,5)=0, safe. So no '?' there.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Let's pick a '?' that is in a position where the adjacent numbers are low. For example, row 0, column 17 is '?'. Let's assume it's safe and uncover it. So the action would be 'uncover (0,17)'. Alternatively, row 7, column 9: '?'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, row 4, column 6: '?'. But if that's a mine, the game ends. Since the score is 1\/10, maybe we need to uncover safe cells to win by uncovering all safe cells. So the best move is to uncover a '?' that is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a cell with number 0. Since there are no 0s adjacent to '?', maybe pick a '?' that's in a region with many 1s, which are more likely to be safe. For example, row 0, column 17: '?'. Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,17)","uncover (0,17)"],"unflags":1,"seed":10,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to play Minesweeper. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 13 rows, which might be a typo. Anyway, the rules say 9x9, so rows and columns are 0-8.

The score is correct flags over 10. \n\nFirst move, usually in Minesweeper, the best first move is to uncover a corner or edge to get some information. Let's pick a corner, like (0,0).

First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the rows are listed from 0 to 12, which might be a formatting error. Wait, maybe it's a typo, and it's supposed to be 9 rows. Let me check again. The problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so probably the rows listed here are 0-8, and the rest are typos. Let's focus on the first 9 rows as the actual board.\n\nThe current board has some cells uncovered with numbers, some marked as '?', which are unknown, and some 'F' for flags, but in the given board, I don't see any 'F's yet. The score is 0.0, flags are 0\/14 (maybe a typo, total mines are 10), and unflags 0. So no flags have been placed yet.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags \/ total mines (10).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the board. Let's list out the uncovered cells and their numbers. Remember, each number represents the count of mines in the 8 adjacent cells.\n\nLet's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's parse the board correctly. The given board rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0 (assuming the extra 0s are typos)\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 → maybe columns 0-8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0 → columns 0-8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0 → columns 0-8: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1\nRow 5: ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 → columns 0-8: ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\nRow 6: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → columns 0-8: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → columns 0-8: ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: ? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → columns 0-8: ? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0\n\nWait, maybe the columns are 0-8, so each row should have 9 elements. Let's correct that. Let's take each row's first 9 characters as the actual cells.\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 1]\nRow 5: [?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 6: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, ?, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered (i.e., known to be safe) or must be mines (to flag).\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0 is 0, which means all adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 0-1) are safe. The 0s in row 0, columns 0,1,5,6,7,8; row 1, columns 0,1,5,6,7,8; row 2, columns 0,1,5,6,7,8; row 3, columns 0-5,6-8 (but row 3, column 6 is 1) — 0 cells mean all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So any cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 2 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. The 2 at (0,2) has adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So the 2 at (0,2) has 8 adjacent cells. The known safe cells here are (0,1), (1,1), (2,1) which are 0, so they can't be mines. The other adjacent cells are (0,3), (1,2)=2, (1,3), (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. The 2 at (0,2) means there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. But (1,2) is 2 (uncovered, so not a mine), (2,2) is 1 (uncovered, not a mine), (2,3) is 1 (uncovered, not a mine). So the remaining cells are (0,3) and (1,3), which are '?'. So those two must contain exactly 2 mines. Therefore, (0,3) and (1,3) are both mines. That's a key insight!\n\nLet me confirm. The 2 at (0,2) is surrounded by:\n\n- (0,1): 0 (safe)\n- (0,3): ? (unknown)\n- (1,1): 0 (safe)\n- (1,2): 2 (safe, since it's uncovered and a number)\n- (1,3): ? (unknown)\n- (2,1): 0 (safe)\n- (2,2): 1 (safe)\n- (2,3): 1 (safe)\n\nSo the only unknown adjacent cells are (0,3) and (1,3). The 2 must have exactly 2 mines in adjacent cells, so both (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. Therefore, these should be flagged.\n\nSimilarly, let's check the 2 at (0,4). Row 0, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3): ?, (0,5)=0 (safe), (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe).\n\nSo adjacent cells are (0,3), (1,3), others are safe. The 2 at (0,4) also needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. The same cells (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent to both (0,2) and (0,4). Since (0,2) requires 2 mines there, and (0,4) also requires 2 mines there, that confirms that (0,3) and (1,3) are indeed mines. So we should flag these two cells.\n\nBut wait, let's check row 1, column 2 is 2. Let's see (1,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1.\n\nSame as (0,2), so (0,3) and (1,3) are the only unknowns here. So 2 mines, so same conclusion.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3)=?, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0.\n\nAgain, (0,3) and (1,3) are the unknowns, so 2 mines here. So all four 2s (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4) are adjacent to (0,3) and (1,3), each requiring 2 mines. Since those are the only possible cells, (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. So we should flag (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nNow, let's check other areas. For example, row 4, column 7 is '?'. Let's look at row 4, column 6 is 1. (4,6) has adjacent cells: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. The 1 at (4,6) means there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. Known cells: (3,5)=0 (safe), (3,6)=1 (safe), (3,7)=1 (safe), (4,5)=0 (safe), (5,5)=0 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe). So the only unknown is (4,7). Therefore, (4,7) must be a mine (since 1 mine needed). So (4,7) is a mine, should be flagged.\n\nWait, (4,6) is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\nRow 3, columns 5-7: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1 (all safe, since they are numbers, not mines)\nRow 4, columns 5-7: (4,5)=0 (safe), (4,6)=1 (current cell), (4,7)=? (unknown)\nRow 5, columns 5-7: (5,5)=0 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe)\n\nSo the adjacent cells to (4,6) are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). Of these, (3,5), (4,5), (5,5) are 0 (safe), (3,6), (3,7), (5,6), (5,7) are 1 (safe, since they are uncovered). So the only unknown is (4,7). Since (4,6) is 1, there must be 1 mine in adjacent cells, so (4,7) is a mine. So flag (4,7).\n\nAnother example: row 5, column 2 is 1. (5,2) has adjacent cells: (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1. The 1 at (5,2) means 1 mine in these 8 cells. Known safe cells: (4,3)=0, (5,3)=0, (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (6,2)=2 (safe), (6,3)=1 (safe). The unknowns are (5,1) and (6,1). So 1 mine in these two. Not sure yet.\n\nRow 6, column 2 is 2. (6,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (5,2)=1 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe), (6,3)=1 (safe). So unknowns are (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). So 2 mines among these.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 3. (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,5)=1, (9,3)=? (but row 9 is beyond 8, so invalid), (9,4)=? (invalid), (9,5)=? (invalid). So in 9x9 grid, (8,4)'s adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (since rows 7 and 8, columns 3-5). (7,4)=1 (safe), (7,5)=0 (safe), (8,5)=1 (safe). So unknowns are (7,3), (8,3). The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent cells. But (7,4)=1 is safe, (7,5)=0 is safe, (8,5)=1 is safe. So (7,3) and (8,3) are adjacent. Wait, 3 mines needed, but only two cells? That can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the grid.\n\nWait, the original problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's re-express the board correctly, ensuring each row has 9 cells. The user's input might have formatting issues, with extra numbers. Let's assume the board is as follows (truncating each row to 9 cells):\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 1]\nRow 5: [?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 6: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, ?, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let's re-examine (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,4), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5) → but row 9 is invalid, so only:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5)\n\nBecause (8,4) is the cell itself, which is not adjacent. So adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5).\n\n(7,4)=1 (safe, uncovered), (7,5)=0 (safe), (8,5)=1 (safe). So the unknowns are (7,3) and (8,3). The 3 at (8,4) needs 3 mines in adjacent cells. But there are only 2 unknown cells here. That's impossible, which suggests that maybe my truncation is wrong. Perhaps the original board has more columns, but the problem states 9x9, so maybe the user input has a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the board is 13x13, but the problem says 9x9. This is confusing. Maybe the initial description has a typo, and the board is 13x13, but the problem says 9x9. Let's proceed with the 9x9 assumption, perhaps the user input has extra numbers by mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is as given, with rows 0-12 and columns 0-12, making it 13x13, but the problem says 9x9. That's conflicting. Maybe the problem statement has a mistake, and the board is 13x13. Let's check the win condition: 10 mines. If it's 13x13, 10 mines is possible.\n\nBut regardless, let's focus on the cells that are clearly safe. For example, the 0 cells. Any cell adjacent to a 0 is safe. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 0-1) are all 0, which are safe, so any cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 4-6) are (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0; (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0; (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0. All these are safe (since 0 means no adjacent mines), so the cells around 0s can be uncovered safely.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 3, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells (row 2-4, column 0-1) are all 0 or 1, which are safe. So any '?' adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered.\n\nWait, let's take row 2, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells are (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0; (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. All these are uncovered and safe, so any '?' adjacent to row 2, column 5 (which is 0) would be safe. But in row 2, column 5's adjacent cells, there are no '?'.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1; (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0; (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0; (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0; (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0; (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1; (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1; (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1; (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0; (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0; (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0; (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0; (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0; (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?, (9,6)=? (if row 9 exists). But if it's 9x9, row 9 is invalid, so only (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6). These are all safe except (8,4)=3, which is a number.\n\nSo, where are the '?' cells? Let's list all '?' positions from the original board (assuming 9x9):\n\nRow 0, column 3: ?\nRow 1, column 3: ?\nRow 4, column 7: ?\nRow 5, column 0: ?\nRow 5, column 1: ?\nRow 6, column 0: ?\nRow 6, column 1: ?\nRow 7, column 0: ?\nRow 7, column 1: ?\nRow 7, column 2: ?\nRow 7, column 3: ?\nRow 8, column 0: ?\nRow 8, column 1: ?\nRow 8, column 2: ?\nRow 8, column 3: ?\n\nThat's a lot of '?'. Now, from earlier analysis, (0,3) and (1,3) are mines (flag them), and (4,7) is a mine (flag). Let's confirm (4,7):\n\nRow 4, column 6 is 1. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1,\n(4,5)=0, (4,7)=?,\n(5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1.\n\nSo the 1 at (4,6) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are 8: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). All except (4,7) are uncovered (0 or 1, which are safe). So (4,7) must be the mine. So flag (4,7).\n\nNow, let's check if there are any cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 3, column 9 is mentioned as '? 1 0' in the original input, but that's beyond 9x9. Maybe the board is 13x13. Let's assume the board is 13x13 as per the input, with rows 0-12 and columns 0-12. That would make more sense with the given rows. So 13x13 grid, 10 mines.\n\nLet's reindex the board as 13 rows (0-12) and 13 columns (0-12). Now, let's parse each row correctly:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, 1, 0]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRow 5: [?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, ?, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 9: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 10: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 11: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 12: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\n\nNow, this is a 13x13 grid. The problem statement said 9x9, which might be a mistake. Let's proceed with 13x13.\n\nNow, let's find safe cells to uncover. Let's look for 0 cells. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 0-1) are all 0, so they are safe. Any cell adjacent to a 0 is safe. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 4-6) are (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0; (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0; (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0. All are safe, so any '?' adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0; (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. All are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1; (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0; (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All are safe.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0; (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. All are safe.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0; (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0; (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0. All are safe.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1; (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1; (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All are safe.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1; (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0; (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All are safe.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0; (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0; (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All are safe.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0; (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0; (9,4)=?, (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0. (9,5)=1 is safe, (9,6)=0 is safe, so (9,4) is '?'.\n\nRow 9, column 5 is 1. Adjacent cells: (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0; (9,4)=?, (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0; (10,4)=?, (10,5)=2, (10,6)=1. (10,5)=2 is safe, (10,6)=1 is safe, (8,4)=3 is safe, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,6)=0 are safe. So unknowns are (9,4) and (10,4).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 10 is '?'. Let's check row 3, column 9 is 1. (3,9)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,8)=0, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1,\n(3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?,\n(4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1.\n\nThe 1 at (3,9) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,8)=0 (safe), (2,9)=1 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe),\n(3,8)=1 (safe), (3,10)=? (unknown),\n(4,8)=1 (safe), (4,9)=1 (safe), (4,10)=1 (safe).\n\nSo only (3,10) is unknown. Therefore, (3,10) must be safe (since 1 mine needed, but all others are safe, so (3,10) can't be a mine). Wait, no: the 1 at (3,9) has 8 adjacent cells. If all except (3,10) are safe (i.e., not mines), then (3,10) must be the mine. Wait, no: the 1 indicates there's 1 mine in the adjacent cells. If all other adjacent cells are safe (not mines), then (3,10) must be the mine. Let's confirm:\n\n(2,8)=0: safe (no mine)\n(2,9)=1: safe (uncovered, number)\n(2,10)=1: safe\n(3,8)=1: safe\n(3,10)=?: unknown\n(4,8)=1: safe\n(4,9)=1: safe\n(4,10)=1: safe\n\nSo the only possible mine is (3,10). Therefore, (3,10) is a mine. So flag (3,10).\n\nAnother example: row 4, column 7 is '?'. Let's check row 4, column 6 is 1. (4,6)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1,\n(4,5)=0, (4,7)=?,\n(5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1.\n\nSame as before: 1 mine needed, so (4,7) is a mine. Flag (4,7).\n\nRow 0, column 3 and row 1, column 3 are '?'. Let's check row 0, column 2 is 2. (0,2)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (0,2) is current cell,\n(1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?,\n(2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1.\n\nThe 2 at (0,2) needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1)=0 (safe), (0,3)=? (unknown),\n(1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=? (unknown),\n(2,1)=0 (safe), (2,2)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe).\n\nSo the only unknowns are (0,3) and (1,3). So 2 mines here, meaning both are mines. Flag (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be uncovered safely. For example, row 3, column 10 is '?', but we determined it's a mine. What about row 3, column 11 is 1. (3,11)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (2,12)=0,\n(3,10)=?, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=0,\n(4,10)=1, (4,11)=1, (4,12)=0.\n\nThe 1 at (3,11) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,10)=1 (safe), (2,11)=1 (safe), (2,12)=0 (safe),\n(3,10)=? (mine), (3,12)=0 (safe),\n(4,10)=1 (safe), (4,11)=1 (safe), (4,12)=0 (safe).\n\nWe already think (3,10) is a mine, so that's 1 mine, which matches the 1 at (3,11). So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 2, column 8 is 0. (2,8)=0. Adjacent cells are all safe, so any cell adjacent to it is safe. Let's check row 2, column 8:\n\n(1,7)=0, (1,8)=0, (1,9)=1,\n(2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=1,\n(3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1.\n\nAll are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 3, column 6 is 1. (3,6)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0,\n(3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1,\n(4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=? (mine).\n\nThe 1 at (3,6) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=0 (safe), (2,7)=0 (safe),\n(3,5)=0 (safe), (3,7)=1 (safe),\n(4,5)=0 (safe), (4,6)=1 (safe), (4,7)=? (mine).\n\nSo (4,7) is the mine, which we already flagged. That's consistent.\n\nNow, let's look for a cell that is safe to uncover. For example, row 9, column 6 is 0. (9,6)=0. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0,\n(9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1,\n(10,5)=2, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=?.\n\nSince (9,6) is 0, all adjacent cells are safe. So (10,7) is adjacent to (9,6)=0, so (10,7) is safe. Therefore, we can uncover (10,7).\n\nLet's confirm: (9,6)=0 means no mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (10,7). So (10,7) is safe, so we can uncover it.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 9, column 7 is 1. (9,7)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0,\n(9,6)=0, (9,7)=1, (9,8)=1,\n(10,6)=1, (10,7)=?, (10,8)=?.\n\nThe 1 at (9,7) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(8,6)=0 (safe), (8,7)=0 (safe), (8,8)=0 (safe),\n(9,6)=0 (safe), (9,8)=1 (safe),\n(10,6)=1 (safe), (10,7)=?, (10,8)=?.\n\nSince (9,6)=0 ensures (10,7) is safe, then (10,7) is not a mine. So the 1 at (9,7) must have its mine in (10,8). But we can uncover (10,7) safely.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a 0 cell that has adjacent '?' cells. For example, row 5, column 8 is 1. (5,8)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,7)=? (mine), (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1,\n(5,7)=1, (5,8)=1, (5,9)=0,\n(6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, (6,9)=0.\n\nThe 1 at (5,8) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. (4,7) is a mine (we think), so that's 1 mine, which matches. So (5,8) is consistent.\n\nAnother 0 cell: row 5, column 9 is 0. (5,9)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1,\n(5,8)=1, (5,9)=0, (5,10)=0,\n(6,8)=0, (6,9)=0, (6,10)=0.\n\nAll are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 6, column 8 is 0. (6,8)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,7)=1, (5,8)=1, (5,9)=0,\n(6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, (6,9)=0,\n(7,7)=0, (7,8)=0, (7,9)=0.\n\nAll are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 7, column 7 is 0. (7,7)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0,\n(7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0,\n(8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0.\n\nAll are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 8, column 6 is 0. (8,6)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0,\n(8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0,\n(9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1.\n\nAll are safe, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 9, column 6 is 0. (9,6)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0,\n(9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1,\n(10,5)=2, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=?.\n\nAs before, (10,7) is adjacent to (9,6)=0, so it's safe. So we can uncover (10,7).\n\nLet's verify: (9,6) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells have no mines. (10,7) is one of those adjacent cells, so it's safe. Uncovering (10,7) is safe.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (10,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (10,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the given board has 13 rows, which might be a formatting error. Wait, the problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the input has a typo. Let's assume it's 9 rows. Let's list the rows properly.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 – wait, no, 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Maybe the user inputted the board with extra spaces. Let me correct that. The user probably meant each row is 9 cells. Let's parse each row as 9 columns:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (assuming the extra numbers are typos)\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 1]\nRow 5: [?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]\nRow 6: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, ?, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nWait, the original input shows 13 rows, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but the problem states it's a 9x9 grid. Let's focus on the possible moves. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Since the score is based on correctly flagged mines, but the win condition is either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the board, let's check cells that are '?', which are unknown. Let's look for cells with numbers that can help deduce mines. For example, in row 0, column 3 is '?', adjacent to row 0 column 2 (value 2) and row 0 column 4 (value 2). The cell (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) which is 2, so the number 2 means there are 2 mines in its 8 neighbors. The neighbors of (0,2) are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So the 2 at (0,2) has neighbors: (0,3), (1,3), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3). Wait, (0,2) is (row 0, column 2). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1): invalid (row -1)\n(row-1, col): invalid\n(row-1, col+1): invalid\n(row, col-1): (0,1)=0\n(row, col+1): (0,3)=?\n(row+1, col-1): (1,1)=0\n(row+1, col): (1,2)=2\n(row+1, col+1): (1,3)=?\n(row+2, col-1): (2,1)=0\n(row+2, col): (2,2)=1\n(row+2, col+1): (2,3)=1\n\nWait, no, adjacent cells are only the 8 surrounding cells: (row-1, col-1), (row-1, col), (row-1, col+1), (row, col-1), (row, col+1), (row+1, col-1), (row+1, col), (row+1, col+1). So for (0,2), the adjacent cells are:\n\n(0-1, 2-1) invalid\n(0-1, 2) invalid\n(0-1, 2+1) invalid\n(0, 2-1) = (0,1) = 0\n(0, 2+1) = (0,3) = ?\n(0+1, 2-1) = (1,1) = 0\n(0+1, 2) = (1,2) = 2\n(0+1, 2+1) = (1,3) = ?\nSo the 2 at (0,2) has two adjacent unknown cells: (0,3) and (1,3). The value 2 means there are 2 mines in these adjacent cells. So (0,3) and (1,3) must both be mines. Because those are the only two unknown cells adjacent to (0,2), and the count is 2. So if (0,2) is 2, then (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Let's check another cell that might confirm this. The cell (0,4) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,4) is row 0, column 4. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0-1,4-1) invalid\n(0-1,4) invalid\n(0-1,4+1) invalid\n(0,4-1) = (0,3) = ?\n(0,4+1) = (0,5) = 0\n(0+1,4-1) = (1,3) = ?\n(0+1,4) = (1,4) = 2\n(0+1,4+1) = (1,5) = 0\nSo the 2 at (0,4) has adjacent unknown cells (0,3) and (1,3). Since the value is 2, those two must be mines. So this confirms that (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Therefore, we should flag those cells. But wait, the current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. The user's current flags are 0\/14 (maybe a typo, total mines are 10). The problem says 10 hidden mines. So 0\/10 flags. So if (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, we should flag them. But let's check if there's a cell that's safe to uncover. Alternatively, maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe. For example, in row 4, column 7 is '?'. Let's look at the cell (4,6) which is 1. (4,6) is row 4, column 6. Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1,\n(4,5)=0, (4,7)=?,\n(5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1.\n\nThe value 1 at (4,6) means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent unknown cell is (4,7). So if (4,6) is 1, and the other adjacent cells are 0,1,1,0,1,1, then the only unknown is (4,7). So (4,7) must be a mine. Wait, no: let's list all 8 adjacent cells for (4,6):\n\nrow-1 (3), col-1 (5): (3,5)=0\nrow-1 (3), col (6): (3,6)=1\nrow-1 (3), col+1 (7): (3,7)=1\nrow (4), col-1 (5): (4,5)=0\nrow (4), col+1 (7): (4,7)=?\nrow+1 (5), col-1 (5): (5,5)=0\nrow+1 (5), col (6): (5,6)=1\nrow+1 (5), col+1 (7): (5,7)=1\n\nSo the known values here are 0,1,1,0,1,1. The sum of these is 0+1+1+0+1+1=4. But the cell (4,6) is 1, which is the number of mines in adjacent cells. Wait, that can't be. The number in a cell is the count of mines in adjacent cells. So (4,6) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine among its 8 adjacent cells. But the adjacent cells have known values (which are numbers, not mines). Wait, no: the numbers are the count of mines, so the cells with numbers are safe (uncover), and '?' are unknown (could be mine or safe), 'F' are flagged as mines. So (3,6)=1 is a safe cell (already uncovered), which means it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. So for (4,6)=1, its adjacent cells include some '?' (unknown) and some uncovered (numbers). The 1 at (4,6) means that among its 8 adjacent cells, 1 is a mine. The adjacent cells that are uncovered (numbers) are safe, so they are not mines. The adjacent cells that are '?' could be mines. Let's list the adjacent cells of (4,6) that are '?': (4,7) is '?'. The others are uncovered (0,1, etc.). So if (4,6) is 1, and the only unknown adjacent cell is (4,7), then (4,7) must be the mine. So (4,7) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (4,7). But wait, let's check another angle. Let's look at row 2, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells: let's say (2,3)=1. Adjacent cells include (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. The 1 at (2,3) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cell here is (1,3)=?, which we previously thought might be a mine. If (1,3) is a mine, then (2,3)=1 would have 1 mine (from (1,3)), which fits. That's consistent. So (1,3) is a mine, (0,3) is a mine, (4,7) is a mine. Let's see if there's a cell that's safe to uncover. For example, row 3, column 10 is mentioned in the original input, but that's beyond 9x9. Maybe the board is displayed with rows 0-12, but it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Let's focus on the 9x9. Let's look for a cell that is '?' and adjacent to a 0. Because a 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so if a cell is adjacent to a 0, it's safe to uncover. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0. So 0 at (0,5) means all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). All of these are already uncovered (numbers), so no '?' there. What about row 3, column 5 is 0. Let's check (3,5)=0. Its adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All adjacent cells are uncovered, so no '?' there. Row 4, column 4 is 0. (4,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered. So no '?' adjacent to 0. How about a cell with number 1 that has only one '?' adjacent. For example, row 2, column 2 is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0. The 1 at (2,2) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (1,3)=?, which we think is a mine. So that's consistent. So (1,3) is a mine. Another cell: row 1, column 2 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. The 2 at (1,2) has two unknown cells: (0,3) and (1,3). Since 2 mines are needed here, both must be mines. Which matches our earlier conclusion. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. So we should flag those. Let's check the current flags: 0\/10. So flagging these would increase the correct flags. Now, the action options are to uncover, flag, or unflag. Since we need to flag the mines we've deduced, let's choose one of them. For example, (0,3) is (row 0, column 3). So the action would be 'flag (0,3)'. Alternatively, (1,3) is (row 1, column 3). Let's confirm again. The cell (0,2)=2 has adjacent (0,3) and (1,3) as the only unknowns. Since 2 mines are needed, both are mines. So flagging either is correct. Let's pick (0,3) first. So the answer should be 'flag (0,3)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (0,3)","flag (0,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided the current state, so let's parse that. The board is 9x9, but the input shows 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, no, the Minesweeper game is 9x9, so maybe the current board display is a typo. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the numbers are the rows, and each row has 9 columns. Let's see: the first line is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — that's 13 numbers, which can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a mistake in the input. But perhaps the user intended each row to be 9 cells. Maybe it's a formatting error where each row is split into multiple parts. Let's assume that each row has 9 cells. Let's list them properly.\n\nAssuming the rows are 0 to 8 (since 9x9). Let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0 (maybe the extra 0s are typos)\nRow 1: 0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0\nRow 2: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 (the \"1 1 1 0\" part, maybe)\nRow 3: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1 (then \"1 ? 1 0\" — maybe row 3 has column 9 as ?, but columns are 0-8, so perhaps that's a mistake. Maybe the user made a formatting error when pasting the board. Let's focus on the cells that are visible and make sense.\n\nThe key is to find a cell that is safe to uncover. Let's look for cells marked with '?' that are adjacent to numbers, which can help determine if they are safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 3 is '?'. Let's check its neighbors. The adjacent cells are:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 2\nRow 0, column 3: F (flagged)\nRow 0, column 4: 2\nRow 1, column 2: 2\nRow 1, column 4: 2\nRow 2, column 2: 1\nRow 2, column 3: 1\nRow 2, column 4: 1\n\nThe cell at (1,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1.\n\nThe number 2 at (0,2) has adjacent cells. Let's see how many mines are around (0,2). The adjacent cells to (0,2) are:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?\n\nSo (0,2) is a 2, which means there are 2 mines in its 8 neighbors. The current neighbors are (0,3)=F (which is a flagged mine, maybe correct) and (1,3)=?. So if (0,3) is a correct flag, then (0,2) has 1 mine (F) and needs 1 more. So (1,3) could be a mine? But (1,2) is 2. Let's check (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1.\n\nSo (1,2)=2 has neighbors (0,3)=F (1 mine) and (1,3)=? (possible 1 mine). That adds up to 2, so (1,3) could be a mine. But (0,4)=2. Let's check (0,4)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0.\n\nSo (0,4)=2 has (0,3)=F (1 mine) and (1,3)=? (possible 1 mine). That also adds up to 2. So (1,3) is adjacent to three 2s (0,2; 1,2; 0,4) which all suggest that (1,3) is a mine. So maybe (1,3) is a mine. But the user's flags are 1\/14, which is 1 correct flag out of 14 flagged? Wait, the score is 0.07142857142857142, which is 1\/14, so they have 14 flags, 1 correct. So the F at (0,3) is probably a wrong flag. Because 1 correct out of 14, so most flags are wrong.\n\nSo (0,3) is F, but it's probably not a mine. Let's consider that. If (0,3) is not a mine, then (0,2)=2's adjacent mines are in other cells. Let's recalculate (0,2)=2's neighbors. (0,2) neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F (maybe not a mine), (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So possible mines in (1,3) and another cell. But (0,2) is 2, so two mines. If (0,3) is not a mine, then (1,3) and maybe (2,3) or (2,2)? But (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. Let's check (2,2)=1. Its neighbors: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0. So (2,2)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (1,3). Then (2,3)=1: neighbors (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. So (2,3)=1 also has 1 mine, which could be (1,3). So if (1,3) is a mine, then (2,2) and (2,3) each have 1 mine, which matches their numbers. Also, (0,2)=2 would have (1,3) and maybe (1,2) is 2, but (1,2) is a number, not a mine. So (0,2) would need two mines, maybe (1,3) and (0,3) is not a mine, but (0,3) is flagged. Since the user's score is 1\/14, that F is likely incorrect. So (1,3) could be a mine, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe (1,3) is safe.\n\nLet's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells with 0s. If a cell is uncovered and shows 0, all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 0: 0. So adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. Those are already uncovered as 0, 0, 0. So nothing new there.\n\nRow 0, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0. All uncovered. So no help.\n\nRow 1, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1. (3,5) is 0, (3,4) is 0, (3,6) is 1.\n\nRow 3, column 0-5: 0,0,0,0,0,0. So all these cells are 0, meaning their adjacent cells are safe. Let's check row 3, column 5: 0. Adjacent cells (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. So (3,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe, which they are.\n\nRow 4, column 0-2: 1,1,1. Column 3-5: 0,0,0. So (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. Adjacent cells to (4,3)=0: (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 5, column 2: 1. Adjacent cells: (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1. The cell (5,2)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells with '?' are (5,1) and (6,1). So if (5,2)=1, then either (5,1) or (6,1) is a mine, but not both.\n\nRow 6, column 2: 2. Adjacent cells: (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. So (6,2)=2 has two mines in its adjacent cells, which are (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). Since (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,3)=1.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe look for a cell that's a '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, if a 0 is uncovered, all adjacent '?' can be uncovered. Let's check the 0 cells.\n\nLooking at row 3, columns 0-5 are all 0. So their adjacent cells (row 2, columns 0-5; row 4, columns 0-5) are all safe. Let's check row 4, column 5: 0. Adjacent cells (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 4, column 6: 1. Adjacent cells (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. So (4,6)=1. The adjacent '?' is (4,7). So (4,7) could be a mine, but maybe not.\n\nRow 3, column 6: 1. Adjacent cells (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=1 has one mine. The adjacent '?' is (4,7). So if (3,6)=1, then (4,7) could be a mine, but (4,6)=1 also has (4,7) as adjacent, so if (4,7) is a mine, that would satisfy both 1s. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that's in a position where all adjacent numbers are satisfied, meaning it's safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a number that has already accounted for all its mines, then the cell is safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 3: '?'. Let's check the number at (1,4)=2. (1,4)=2's adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. So (1,4)=2 needs two mines. If (0,3) is a wrong flag (since score is 1\/14), then (0,3) is not a mine. So (1,4)=2's mines could be (1,3) and another. But (2,3)=1 and (2,4)=1. (2,3)=1's adjacent cells: (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. So (2,3)=1 has one mine, which could be (1,3). (2,4)=1's adjacent cells: (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0. So (2,4)=1 also has one mine, which could be (1,3). So if (1,3) is a mine, then (2,3) and (2,4) are satisfied (each has 1 mine), and (1,4)=2 would have (1,3) and maybe (0,3) is not a mine, so (1,4) would need another mine. But (0,4)=2's adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. So (0,4)=2 needs two mines. If (1,3) is a mine, and (0,3) is not, then (0,4)=2 would need another mine, but where? Maybe (1,4) is a number, not a mine. So this is getting too speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's a '?' and not adjacent to any numbers. Those are safe because if a cell is adjacent to a 0, it's safe, but if it's not adjacent to any numbers, it's also safe (since 0 means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe, and if a cell is far from numbers, it's part of a 0 area). Wait, but in Minesweeper, if you uncover a 0, all adjacent cells are automatically uncovered. So any '?' that's not adjacent to any numbers (i.e., not adjacent to any non-zero or non-0 cells) is part of a 0 region and can be safely uncovered.\n\nLooking at the board, let's find such cells. For example, row 3, column 9 is '?', but columns are 0-8. Let's focus on the 9x9 grid. Let's assume the rows are 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nLooking at row 0: [0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [0,0,2,?,2,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,?,1]\nRow 5: [?, ?,1,0,0,0,1,1,1]\nRow 6: [?, ?,2,1,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, ?,1,0,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, ?,3,1,0,0,0]\n\nNow, let's list the '?' positions:\n\nRow 1, column 3: (1,3)\nRow 4, column 7: (4,7)\nRow 5, columns 0-1: (5,0), (5,1)\nRow 6, columns 0-1: (6,0), (6,1)\nRow 7, columns 0-3: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3)\nRow 8, columns 0-3: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)\n\nNow, let's check which of these '?' are adjacent to 0s. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so if a '?' is adjacent to a 0, it's safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 3, columns 0-5 are all 0. The adjacent cells to row 3, column 5 (which is 0) are row 2, column 5 (0), row 4, column 5 (0), etc. So row 4, column 5 is 0. Adjacent to row 4, column 5 (0) is row 4, column 6 (1), row 5, column 5 (0). So row 5, column 5 is 0. Adjacent to row 5, column 5 (0) is row 4, column 5 (0), row 5, column 4 (0), row 5, column 6 (1), row 6, column 5 (0). So row 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent to row 6, column 5 (0) is row 5, column 5 (0), row 6, column 4 (1), row 6, column 6 (0), row 7, column 5 (0). Row 7, column 5 is 0. Adjacent to row 7, column 5 (0) is row 6, column 5 (0), row 7, column 4 (1), row 7, column 6 (0), row 8, column 5 (1). \n\nSo the 0 regions are in rows 0-3 columns 0-5, row 4 columns 3-5, row 5 columns 3-5, row 6 columns 5-6, row 7 columns 5-6, row 8 columns 6-8. \n\nNow, the '?' in row 4, column 7: let's check its adjacent cells. (4,7) is in row 4, column 7. Adjacent cells are (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1. All these are numbers (1s), so (4,7) is adjacent to 1s. So not a 0 region.\n\nThe '?' in row 1, column 3: adjacent to numbers (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1. All numbers, so not 0 region.\n\nThe '?' in row 5,0 and 5,1: let's check their adjacent cells. (5,0) adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,1)=?, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. So (5,0) is adjacent to 1s and 2, and '?'. (5,1) adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. Also adjacent to numbers.\n\nRow 6,0 and 6,1: (6,0) adjacent cells: (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?. (6,1) adjacent cells: (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=?, (6,2)=2, (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?. Adjacent to 1 and 2, but mostly '?'.\n\nRow 7,0-3: (7,0) adjacent cells: (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?, (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?. (7,1) similar. (7,2) adjacent to (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,3)=?, (8,2)=?, etc. (7,3) adjacent to (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=?, (7,4)=1, (8,3)=?, (8,4)=3. So (7,3) is adjacent to (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,4)=3. \n\nRow 8,0-3: (8,0) adjacent cells: (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=?, (9,0)... but rows are 0-8, so (8,0) is bottom row. (8,3) adjacent to (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=3, (9,3)... no. (8,4)=3. Let's check (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,5)=1, (9,3)... no, row 8 is last. So (8,4)=3's adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (8,6). (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. So (8,4)=3 needs 3 mines in (7,3), (8,3), and possibly another. \n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in a 0 region. Wait, the 0 regions are already uncovered, so any '?' not adjacent to numbers is part of a 0 region and can be uncovered safely. Let's look for '?' that are not adjacent to any numbers. For example, row 8, column 6 is 0 (from the given board: \"0 0 0 0 3 1 0 0 0\" for row 8). So row 8, column 6 is 0. Its adjacent cells are row 7, column 5=0, row 7, column 6=0, row 7, column 7=0, row 8, column 5=1, row 8, column 7=0, row 9, column 5... no. So row 8, column 6=0, so adjacent cells (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=0. So (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (8,7)=0. These are all uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5=0 (from \"0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\" for row 7). So row 7, column 5=0. Adjacent cells (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5=0 (from \"0 0 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\" for row 6). Adjacent cells (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 5=0 (from \"? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\" for row 5). Adjacent cells (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 5=0 (from \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1\" for row 4). Adjacent cells (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 5=0 (from \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" for row 3). Adjacent cells (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 regions are already uncovered. Therefore, all '?' are adjacent to numbers, so we need to find a '?' that is safe based on the numbers.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 7: (4,7) is '?'. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1,\n\n(4,6)=1,          (4,8)=1,\n\n(5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1.\n\nSo (4,7) is surrounded by 8 cells, all of which are 1s. Let's consider each of these 1s. For example, (3,6)=1: it has 8 adjacent cells, one of which is a mine. The adjacent cells to (3,6) are:\n\n(2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0,\n\n(3,5)=0, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1,\n\n(4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?.\n\nSo (3,6)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The possible mines are (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7). But (3,7)=1, which is a number, not a mine. (3,8)=1, also a number. (4,6)=1, number. So the only possible mine is (4,7). So (3,6)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\nSimilarly, (3,7)=1: adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0,\n\n(3,6)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)... no, column 8 is max.\n\n(4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1.\n\nSo (3,7)=1 has 1 mine. The adjacent cells are (3,6)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1. All numbers except (4,7). So (3,7)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\nSame for (3,8)=1: adjacent cells include (4,7)=?, so its mine is (4,7).\n\n(4,6)=1: adjacent cells are (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. So (4,6)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\n(4,8)=1: adjacent cells are (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)... no, (4,7)=?, (4,9)... no, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1, (5,9)... no. So (4,8)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\n(5,6)=1: adjacent cells are (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0. So (5,6)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\n(5,7)=1: adjacent cells are (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=1, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0. So (5,7)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\n(5,8)=1: adjacent cells are (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, etc. So (5,8)=1's mine is (4,7).\n\nWow, all 8 adjacent 1s to (4,7) have their only possible mine as (4,7). That means (4,7) must be a mine! Because each of those 1s needs exactly one mine, and the only common cell they all share is (4,7). So (4,7) is a mine. Therefore, we shouldn't uncover it. So we need to find another '?'.\n\nLet's look at row 1, column 3: (1,3). Earlier analysis suggested it might be a mine, but let's confirm. The adjacent cells are (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1.\n\n(0,2)=2: needs 2 mines. Its adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So possible mines: (0,3) and (1,3).\n\n(0,4)=2: adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. Possible mines: (0,3) and (1,3).\n\n(1,2)=2: adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. Possible mines: (0,3) and (1,3).\n\n(1,4)=2: adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. Possible mines: (0,3) and (1,3).\n\n(2,2)=1: adjacent cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0. Possible mine: (1,3).\n\n(2,3)=1: adjacent cells: (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. Possible mine: (1,3).\n\n(2,4)=1: adjacent cells: (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0. Possible mine: (1,3).\n\nSo if (0,3)=F is a wrong flag (since score is 1\/14), then (0,3) is not a mine. Then (0,2)=2, (0,4)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2 each need 2 mines. The only possible mine in their adjacent cells is (1,3). But each of these 2s needs 2 mines, so if (1,3) is a mine, they would only have 1 mine each, which is not enough. Therefore, (0,3) must be a correct mine (since 1\/14 correct flags), but that's the only correct one. So (0,3) is a mine. Then (0,2)=2 has (0,3) as 1 mine, so needs 1 more, which would be (1,3). Similarly, (0,4)=2 has (0,3) as 1 mine, needs 1 more, which is (1,3). (1,2)=2 has (0,3) as 1 mine, needs 1 more (1,3). (1,4)=2 has (0,3) as 1 mine, needs 1 more (1,3). Then (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1 each have (1,3) as their 1 mine. That all adds up. So (1,3) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover (1,3).\n\nNext, let's look at row 5, columns 0 and 1: (5,0) and (5,1). Let's take (5,0). Its adjacent cells are (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,1)=?, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. (4,0)=1: adjacent cells are (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1. So (4,0)=1 has 1 mine in (5,0), (5,1), or (5,2). But (5,2)=1 is a number, not a mine. So (4,0)=1's mine is in (5,0) or (5,1).\n\n(4,1)=1: adjacent cells are (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1. So (4,1)=1's mine is also in (5,0) or (5,1).\n\n(4,2)=1: adjacent cells are (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0. So (4,2)=1's mine is in (5,1).\n\n(6,2)=2: adjacent cells are (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. So (6,2)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which include (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3).\n\nSince (4,2)=1's mine is (5,1), then (5,1) is a mine. Then (4,0)=1 and (4,1)=1's mines must be in (5,0) or (5,1). But (5,1) is a mine, so (4,0)=1 and (4,1)=1 each have their mine as (5,1), which satisfies their 1 count. So (5,0) is not a mine. Therefore, (5,0) is safe to uncover.\n\nYes! Let's verify:\n\n(4,0)=1 needs 1 mine. Its adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (5,2)=1 is not a mine. If (5,1) is a mine (from (4,2)=1), then (4,0)=1's mine is (5,1), so (5,0) is safe.\n\n(4,1)=1 needs 1 mine. Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Same as above, (5,1) is the mine, so (5,0) is safe.\n\n(5,0) is adjacent to (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,1)=?, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. Since (5,0) is not a mine, uncovering it would show a number indicating how many mines are around it. Since (5,1) is a mine, (5,0) would show 1 (because (5,1) is a mine, and others are not). So (5,0) is safe to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,0)","uncover (5,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The board is 9x9, but looking at the current board provided, it's actually 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in the board display, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nThe current board has some cells uncovered, some flagged (F), and some unknown (?) or with numbers. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10, so we need to flag all 10 mines to win.\n\nFirst, let's list the known cells. The input shows a grid with rows 0 to 12, but Minesweeper is 9x9, so maybe it's a typo. Let's assume rows 0-8 and columns 0-8, but the given board might have more columns. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different grid size, but I'll proceed with the data given.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (columns 0-12)\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0\nRow 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: ? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 10: ? ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 11: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nBut since Minesweeper is 9x9, maybe the rows 0-8 and columns 0-8 are the actual board. Let's focus on those. Let's correct the rows to 0-8 and columns 0-8:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1\nRow 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1\nRow 6: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: ? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's analyze each cell. Let's start with row 0, column 3 is flagged (F). We need to check if that's a correct mine. But let's look for safe cells to uncover.\n\nIn row 1, column 3 is '?'. Let's check its neighbors. The cell (1,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1. The number in (0,2) is 2, which is the count of mines in its 8 neighbors. (0,2) has neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So the mine count for (0,2) is 2. The flagged cell (0,3) is a neighbor, so if that's a mine, then (0,2) has 1 mine already (F) and needs 1 more. The other neighbors of (0,2) are (1,3). So (1,3) must be a mine? Because (0,2) is 2, and if (0,3) is a mine (F), then (1,3) must be a mine to make the total 2. Wait, let's confirm:\n\nNeighbors of (0,2) (row 0, column 2):\n- (0,1) = 0 (safe)\n- (0,3) = F (flagged as mine)\n- (1,1) = 0 (safe)\n- (1,2) = 2 (uncovered, number)\n- (1,3) = ? (unknown)\n- (2,1) = 0 (safe)\n- (2,2) = 1 (uncovered, number)\n- (2,3) = 1 (uncovered, number)\n\nSo the 8 neighbors of (0,2) are: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). The cell (0,2) shows 2, meaning there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. The flagged cell (0,3) is one of them. So if (0,3) is a correct mine, then there's 1 more mine in the remaining 7 neighbors. The remaining cells are (0,1) is 0 (safe), (1,1) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 2 (safe, since it's a number), (2,1) is 0 (safe), (2,2) is 1 (safe), (2,3) is 1 (safe). So the only unknown is (1,3). Therefore, (1,3) must be a mine to make the total 2 for (0,2). So (1,3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (1,3).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell to confirm. Let's look at (1,2)=2. Its neighbors are:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1.\n\nSo (1,2) is 2, meaning 2 mines in its neighbors. The flagged cell (0,3) is a neighbor, so that's 1 mine. The other possible mine is (1,3), so (1,3) must be a mine. That confirms it. So (1,3) should be flagged.\n\nBut wait, the current flags are 1\/14, meaning 1 flagged mine (probably (0,3)), but there are 14 flags? No, the Flags: 1\/14 probably means 1 flag placed, 14 total flags? No, the score is 0.07142857142857142, which is 1\/14, but the total mines are 10. So maybe the user's current correct flags are 1 (out of 10), and they have 14 flags placed (incorrect ones). So (0,3) might be an incorrect flag. Because 1\/10 is 0.1, but the score is 1\/14, which is 0.0714. So the 1 correct flag is among 14 placed flags. So (0,3) is a flag, but maybe it's not a mine. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the Flags: 1\/14 means 1 correct flag out of 14 total flags placed. So the user has placed 14 flags, 1 of which is correct. So (0,3) is one of the 14 flags, but maybe not a mine.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So the initial assumption that (0,3) is a mine might be wrong. Let's reevaluate.\n\nLet's take (0,4)=2. Its neighbors are:\n\n(0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0.\n\n(0,4) is 2, so 2 mines in neighbors. If (0,3) is a mine (F), then there's 1 mine, and another mine must be in (1,3) or (1,4) or (2,3) or (2,4). But (1,4)=2 is a number, so it's safe. (2,3)=1 and (2,4)=1 are numbers, safe. (1,5)=0 and (0,5)=0 are safe. So the only unknown is (1,3). So (0,4) would also require (1,3) to be a mine if (0,3) is a mine. But if (0,3) is not a mine, then (0,4) needs 2 mines in its neighbors, which would include (1,3) and maybe another.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (2,3)=1. Its neighbors are:\n\n(1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0.\n\n(2,3) is 1, so 1 mine in neighbors. The neighbors are (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2 (safe), (2,2)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (3,2)=0 (safe), (3,3)=0 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe). So only (1,3) is unknown. Therefore, (1,3) must be the mine here. So (2,3)=1 implies (1,3) is a mine. That's a solid clue. Because all other neighbors of (2,3) are safe (numbers or 0), so the only possible mine is (1,3). Therefore, (1,3) is definitely a mine. So we should flag (1,3).\n\nBut wait, the user's current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. Since (1,3) is a mine, we should flag it. But let's check if it's already flagged. Looking at row 1, column 3: in the given board, row 1 is \"0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so column 3 is '?', not flagged. So we need to flag (1,3).\n\nBut let's confirm with another cell. Let's take (1,4)=2. Its neighbors are:\n\n(0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0.\n\n(1,4) is 2, so 2 mines in neighbors. The neighbors are (0,3)=F (maybe mine), (1,3)=?, others are safe. So if (0,3) is not a mine, then (1,3) and another mine? But (2,3)=1 and (2,4)=1 are numbers, so their neighbors are safe. (2,3)=1 has only (1,3) as possible mine, so (1,3) must be a mine. Therefore, (1,4)=2 would have (1,3) as one mine, and maybe (0,3) as another. But if (0,3) is not a mine, then (1,4) would need 2 mines, but only (1,3) is possible, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (0,3) must be a mine (F) and (1,3) must be a mine. But the score is 1\/14, so if (0,3) is a mine, that's 1 correct flag, and (1,3) is another mine, so flagging (1,3) would increase the correct flags to 2, improving the score.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (0,3) is not a mine. Let's suppose (0,3) is not a mine. Then (2,3)=1 requires (1,3) to be a mine. Then (0,2)=2 would have neighbors: (0,3) (not mine), (1,3) (mine), so that's 1 mine, but (0,2) is 2, so there must be another mine. The other neighbors of (0,2) are (1,2)=2 (safe), (2,2)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), etc. So where is the other mine? (0,2) neighbors: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=not mine, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=mine, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So only 1 mine (1,3). But (0,2) is 2, so that's a problem. Therefore, (0,3) must be a mine, making (0,2) have 2 mines: (0,3) and (1,3). That works.\n\nSo (0,3) is a mine (correct flag), and (1,3) is a mine (needs to be flagged). So the action should be to flag (1,3). But let's check if there are other safe cells to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 10 is '?', but maybe focusing on the 9x9 grid. Let's check row 4, column 7: it's '?'. Its neighbors are:\n\nRow 4, column 7 (4,7). Neighbors are (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1.\n\nAll these neighbors are 1s. So (4,7) is surrounded by 1s. What does that mean? The number in (3,6)=1: its neighbors include (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. The unknown is (4,7). If (4,7) is a mine, then (3,6) would have 1 mine, which matches. But (3,7)=1: neighbors are (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1. So (3,7)=1 also has 1 mine, which would be (4,7). Similarly, (3,8)=1's neighbors include (4,7). So if (4,7) is a mine, then all these 1s are satisfied. But if (4,7) is safe, then where is the mine for each 1? It would have to be in another cell, but all other neighbors are 0s or 1s (safe). So (4,7) is likely a mine. But let's check (4,6)=1: neighbors are (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. So (4,6)=1 has 1 mine, which would be (4,7). So yes, (4,7) is a mine. So we should flag (4,7) as well.\n\nBut let's get back. The most urgent is (1,3) which is a mine based on (2,3)=1. So the action should be to flag (1,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (1,3)","flag (1,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided the current board, but wait, the board is supposed to be 9x9, but the given board has 13 rows and 13 columns each. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed. The key is to look for safe cells to uncover or determine where mines might be.\n\nThe score is 0.142857, which is 1\/7, since 1\/7 ≈ 0.142857. The flags are 2\/14, meaning the user has placed 14 flags, but only 2 are correct. Wait, the total mines are 10, so 2 correct flags out of 14 flagged cells. That's a lot of incorrect flags. The unflags are 0, so they haven't unflagged any yet.\n\nLooking at the board, let's parse a row. Let's take row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So columns 0-12. The 'F's are flagged cells. Let's check if any of these F's are in positions that can't be mines. For example, in Minesweeper, if a numbered cell has adjacent flags equal to its number, then the other adjacent cells are safe. Let's look for such cases.\n\nTake row 2: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\". Let's take the cell at (2,2) which is '1'. Its adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Let's check those. (2,2) is 1, so one mine in those 8 cells. If any of those are flagged, maybe we can confirm. But (2,3) is 1, so (2,3) has one mine in its adjacent cells. Let's look at row 3: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0\". The '?' at (3,10) is unknown. Let's check row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0\". The '?' here is (4,7). Row 5: \"1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\" has a '?' at (5,1). Row 6: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" has '?'s at (6,0), (6,1). Row 7: \"? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" has '?'s at (7,0)-(7,3). Row 8: \"? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" has '?'s at (8,0)-(8,3). Row 9: \"? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" has '?'s at (9,0)-(9,4). Row 10: \"? ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\" has '?'s at (10,0)-(10,4) and (10,8)-(10,12). Rows 11 and 12 are all '?'.\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers that have known adjacent flags. For example, in row 0, there's an 'F' at (0,3). Let's check the cell (0,2) which is '2'. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 2, so there should be 2 mines in those 7 cells. (0,3) is flagged (F), so if that's a mine, then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. (0,4) is '2', which is a number, so it's safe (already uncovered). (1,3) is also 'F' (row 1, column 3). So (0,2) has (0,3) and (1,3) as F's. That's two F's. Since (0,2) is 2, that means those two F's must be the two mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are correct flags. That would contribute to the correct flags (since 2 correct, as per the score). So those are likely correct.\n\nNow, let's find a cell that we can safely uncover. Let's look for a cell with a number that has all adjacent mines accounted for by flags, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, take cell (2,9) which is '1' (row 2, column 9). Its adjacent cells are (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), (2,8), (2,10), (3,8), (3,9), (3,10). (2,9) is 1, so one mine in those 8 cells. Let's check the adjacent cells: (1,8) is 0 (row 1, column 8), (1,9) is 0 (row 1, column 9), (1,10) is 0 (row 1, column 10), (2,8) is 1 (row 2, column 8), (2,10) is 1 (row 2, column 10), (3,8) is 1 (row 3, column 8), (3,9) is 1 (row 3, column 9), (3,10) is '?' (row 3, column 10). So the '?' at (3,10) is adjacent to (2,9)=1. If (2,9) has 1 mine, and none of the other adjacent cells are flagged (since all others are numbers or 0), then maybe the '?' at (3,10) is not a mine? Wait, no—if (2,9) is 1, then exactly one of the 8 adjacent cells is a mine. But all adjacent cells except (3,10) are uncovered and are numbers (0,1), which are safe. So that means the mine must be in (3,10). Wait, but (3,10) is '?', so if (2,9) is 1, then (3,10) is a mine. But that's a possible mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at a cell with 0. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,5) is 0. Adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 2 (safe), (0,6) is 0 (safe), (1,4) is 2 (safe), (1,5) is 0 (safe), (1,6) is 0 (safe). So (0,5) being 0 confirms that all adjacent cells are safe, which they are, so no new info there.\n\nAnother 0: row 3, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is 0, (2,1) is 0, (3,1) is 0, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1. All are safe, so no new info.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2) is 0, (3,3) is 0, (3,4) is 0, (4,2) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 0, (5,4) is 0. All safe, so 0 is correct.\n\nLet's look for a cell with a number where the number of adjacent '?'s plus flags equals the number. For example, row 8, column 4 is 3. Let's check its adjacent cells. (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,3) is '?', (7,4) is 1, (7,5) is 0, (8,3) is '?', (8,5) is 1, (9,3) is '?', (9,4) is '?', (9,5) is 1. So (8,4)=3. The adjacent cells that are '?' are (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). The others are numbers (safe). So 3 mines must be in those 4 '?'s. Not sure yet.\n\nRow 10, column 5 is 2. Adjacent cells: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (10,4), (10,6), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). (9,4) is '?', (9,5) is 1, (9,6) is 0, (10,4) is '?', (10,6) is 1, (11,4) is '?', (11,5) is '?', (11,6) is '?'. (10,5)=2. So 2 mines in those adjacent cells. The '?'s here are (9,4), (10,4), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). Maybe not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 0, (3,4) is 0, (3,6) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 0, (4,6) is 1. All are safe, so the 0 is correct. Any '?' adjacent to a 0? Let's see row 3, column 7 is 1. Adjacent cells include (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (3,7)=1. (4,7) is '?', so if (3,7)=1, then (4,7) could be a mine, but let's check (4,7)'s other adjacent cells. (4,7) is '?', adjacent to (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1. So (4,7) is surrounded by 1s. Each of those 1s has (4,7) as a neighbor. If (4,7) is a mine, then each of those 1s would have exactly one mine (which is (4,7)), which would make sense. So (4,7) is likely a mine. But the user has 14 flags, but only 2 correct. So maybe (4,7) is a mine that's not flagged yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a '?' that is definitely safe. Let's look at row 2, column 5 which is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). All are safe (numbers), so 0 is correct. What about row 3, column 9 which is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,8), (2,9), (2,10), (3,8), (3,10), (4,8), (4,9), (4,10). (3,9)=1. (2,8)=1, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,10)='?', (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1. So (3,9)=1. If (3,10) is a mine, then that's the only mine, so that's possible. But maybe (3,10) is safe? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check the flags. The user has 14 flags, but only 2 correct. So most of the F's are incorrect. For example, in row 0, column 3 is F, and row 1, column 3 is F. We thought those might be correct because (0,2)=2 has two F's adjacent. Let's confirm: (0,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2. So the adjacent cells that could be mines are (0,3) and (1,3). Since (0,2) is 2, those two F's must be the mines. So those are correct. So that's 2 correct flags, which matches the score (2\/14, but the score is 2\/10? Wait, the score is mines flagged correctly \/ total mines (10). So 2\/10 is 0.2, but the given score is 0.142857, which is 1\/7. Oh, maybe I miscalculated. 1\/7 is approximately 0.142857. So 1 correct flag out of 7 total mines? No, the problem says total mines are 10. So 1\/7 is 0.142857, but 10 mines. Maybe the score is (correct flags) \/ (flags placed). Because 2 correct flags out of 14 placed flags is 2\/14=1\/7≈0.142857. Oh, that makes sense. The problem statement says: \"the final score is calculated as follows: the mines you flag correctly \/ total mines.\" Wait, no. Let me check again. The user's score is 0.142857, which is 1\/7. The Flags are 2\/14, which is 2 flags placed out of 14? No, \"Flags: 2\/14\" probably means 2 correct flags out of 14 flagged cells. So 2 correct, 12 incorrect. The score is correct flags \/ total mines (10), so 2\/10=0.2, but 0.142857 is 1\/7. Maybe the problem statement has a typo, but regardless, the user has many incorrect flags.\n\nSo, the user has flagged 14 cells, 2 correct, 12 incorrect. So some of the F's on the board are wrong. For example, maybe the F's at (0,3) and (1,3) are correct (as per (0,2)=2 and (1,2)=2). Let's check (1,2)=2. (1,2) is row 1, column 2, which is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1. So (1,2)=2 has two F's adjacent, which would mean those are the two mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are correct. So those two F's are correct. The rest of the 12 F's are incorrect.\n\nSo, to proceed, we need to find a cell to uncover that is safe. Let's look for a cell with a number where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, meaning the remaining adjacent '?'s are safe. For example, take cell (2,2)=1 (row 2, column 2). Its adjacent cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0. So (2,2)=1. The adjacent F is (1,3). So if (1,3) is a mine (which we think it is), then (2,2)=1 has exactly one mine (the F), so all other adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells here are all uncovered (0s and 1s), so no '?'s here.\n\nAnother cell: (2,3)=1 (row 2, column 3). Adjacent cells: (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. (2,3)=1. The adjacent F is (1,3). So if (1,3) is a mine, then (2,3)=1 has one mine, so the rest are safe. All adjacent cells are uncovered, so no new info.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 0=1. Adjacent cells: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1. (4,0)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent '?'s are (5,0) and (5,1). So either (5,0) or (5,1) is a mine, but not both.\n\nRow 5, column 2=1. Adjacent cells: (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1. (5,2)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (5,1) and (6,1). So either (5,1) or (6,1) is a mine.\n\nRow 6, column 2=2. Adjacent cells: (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. (6,2)=2. So two mines in adjacent cells. The '?'s here are (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). So two of these are mines.\n\nRow 7, column 4=1. Adjacent cells: (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=?, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1. (7,4)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (7,3) and (8,3). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 8, column 4=3. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,5)=1, (9,3)=?, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=1. (8,4)=3. So three mines in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). So three of these four are mines.\n\nRow 9, column 6=0. Adjacent cells: (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (9,5)=1, (9,7)=1, (10,5)=2, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=1. (9,6)=0. So all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are all numbers, so no '?'s here.\n\nRow 9, column 7=1. Adjacent cells: (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,8)=1, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=1, (10,8)=?. (9,7)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?' is (10,8). So (10,8) could be a mine, but let's check (10,7)=1. (10,7)=1's adjacent cells include (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1, (9,8)=1, (10,6)=1, (10,8)=?, (11,6)=?, (11,7)=?, (11,8)=?. So (10,7)=1 has one mine, which could be (10,8) or one of the (11,x) cells.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe, so any '?' adjacent to a 0 can be safely uncovered. Let's look for 0s and their adjacent '?'s.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered (0s and 1s), so no '?'s.\n\nRow 2, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 0, column 5=0. Same as above.\n\nRow 3, column 0=0. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=0, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 1=0. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (3,0)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 2=0. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=0, (3,3)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 3=0. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 4=0. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 3=0. Adjacent cells: (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 4=0. Adjacent cells: (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 3=0. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4=0. Adjacent cells: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 5=1. Adjacent cells: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0. (8,5)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?' is (9,4). So (9,4) could be a mine.\n\nRow 9, column 5=1. Adjacent cells: (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=?, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=?, (10,5)=2, (10,6)=1. (9,5)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (9,4) and (10,4). So one of these is a mine.\n\nSince all the 0 cells have no adjacent '?'s, we need to look for cells with numbers where the number of adjacent flags is less than the number, and the remaining '?'s can be uncovered if the number minus flags equals the number of '?'s, meaning they are all mines. But that's for flagging. Alternatively, if the number of flags is equal to the number, then the '?'s are safe.\n\nLet's take cell (2,8)=1 (row 2, column 8). Adjacent cells: (1,7)=0, (1,8)=0, (1,9)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. (2,8)=1. All adjacent cells are uncovered, so no '?'s.\n\nRow 3, column 7=1. Adjacent cells: (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=1, (3,6)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=1. (3,7)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?' is (4,7). So (4,7) is a mine candidate. If (4,7) is a mine, then (3,7)=1 is satisfied. Let's check (4,7)'s other adjacent cells. (4,7) is adjacent to (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1. Each of these 1s would have (4,7) as their only mine, which fits. So (4,7) is likely a mine. But the user has 14 flags, so maybe they already flagged it, but if not, maybe we should flag it. But the user's action could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is surrounded by numbers that indicate it's safe. For example, take the '?' at (3,10) (row 3, column 10). Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,10) is '?'. Adjacent cells are (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1. So (3,10) is surrounded by 1s. Each of these 1s has (3,10) as a neighbor. If (3,10) is a mine, then each of those 1s would have exactly one mine (this one), which is possible. But if (3,10) is safe, then each of those 1s must have their mine elsewhere. Let's check (2,10)=1. (2,10)=1's adjacent cells: (1,9)=0, (1,10)=0, (1,11)=0, (2,9)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?, (3,11)=1. So (2,10)=1 has one mine. If (3,10) is safe, then the mine must be in one of the other adjacent cells, but all others are 0 or 1 (safe). So the mine must be (3,10). So (3,10) is a mine.\n\nAnother '?' is (5,1) (row 5, column 1). Let's check its adjacent cells. (5,1)=?. Adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. (5,1) is adjacent to (4,0)=1, which needs one mine. (4,0)=1's adjacent cells are (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1. So (4,0)=1 has two '?'s: (5,0) and (5,1). So one of them is a mine. (5,1) is also adjacent to (5,2)=1, which has adjacent cells (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1. (5,2)=1 has two '?'s: (5,1) and (6,1). So one of them is a mine. If (5,1) is a mine, then (4,0)=1 and (5,2)=1 are satisfied. Then (6,1) would be safe. If (5,1) is safe, then (5,0) and (6,1) are mines. But we don't have enough info.\n\nMaybe the best bet is to find a '?' that is not adjacent to any numbers, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, look for a '?' in a corner. For example, row 11, column 0 is '?'. But it's far from any numbers, so we can't tell.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's been uncovered and has a number, and the number of adjacent '?'s is zero, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, let's check the initial input again. The user's current board has rows 0-12, which is 13 rows, each with 13 columns. But the game is supposed to be 9x9. Maybe it's a formatting error, and the rows are 0-8 (9 rows) with columns 0-8 (9 columns). Let's assume that the board is 9x9, and the given rows are a mistake. Let's reindex.\n\nAssuming the board is 9x9, let's take the first 9 rows and first 9 columns. So row 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 (columns 0-8). Row 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0. Row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0. Row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1. Row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1. Row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1. Row 6: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0. Row 7: ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0. Row 8: ? ? ? ? 3 1 0 0 0. That makes more sense (9x9). Let's work with this corrected board.\n\nNow, row 4, column 7 is '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. (4,7) is in row 4, column 7. Adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1. So (4,7) is surrounded by 1s. Each of these 1s has (4,7) as a neighbor. If (4,7) is a mine, then each 1 has exactly one mine (this one), which fits. So (4,7) is a mine.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is '?'. Adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. (4,0)=1 has adjacent cells (3,0)=0, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1. So (4,0)=1 has two '?'s (5,0 and 5,1), one of which is a mine. (5,2)=1 has adjacent cells (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (5,1)=?, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1. So (5,2)=1 has two '?'s (5,1 and 6,1), one of which is a mine. If (5,1) is a mine, then (4,0)=1 and (5,2)=1 are satisfied. Then (5,0) and (6,1) are safe. If (5,1) is safe, then (5,0) and (6,1) are mines.\n\nRow 6, column 0 and 1 are '?'. (6,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. (6,2)=2. So two mines in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). So two of these are mines.\n\nRow 7, column 4=1. Adjacent cells: (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=?, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1. (7,4)=1. So one mine in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (7,3) and (8,3). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 8, column 4=3. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,5)=1, (9,3)=? (but row 8 is the last row), so (8,3)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1. So adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (since 9 is beyond 8). So (8,4)=3 has (7,3), (8,3) as '?'s. (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1 are safe. So (8,4)=3 needs 3 mines in adjacent cells. But there are only two '?'s (7,3 and 8,3). That can't be. So my assumption of 9x9 might be wrong. Maybe the board is 13x13 as given, but the game is 9x9, so the extra rows and columns are a mistake. Alternatively, the user input has a formatting error.\n\nRegardless, let's try to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. If there's a 0, all adjacent '?'s are safe. Let's check the original board again for 0s and their adjacent '?'s.\n\nIn row 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells (row 3, column 5) in the original board are (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All are uncovered, so no '?'s.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=0, (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 9, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (9,5)=1, (9,7)=1, (10,5)=2, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nSo no 0s have adjacent '?'s. Then, let's look for a cell with a number where the number of adjacent flags is less than the number, and the remaining '?'s are mines. But we need to uncover a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, look for a '?' that is in a region with no numbers, which are likely safe. For example, the bottom-right corner has many '?'s, but they are far from numbers, so they might be safe. But without info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the user has 14 flags, which is more than the total mines (10), so some flags are incorrect. We could unflag some, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the problem asks for an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nThe score is 0.142857, which is 1\/7, so 1 correct flag out of 7 flagged? Or 2\/14=1\/7. The Flags are 2\/14, so 2 correct, 14 flagged. So 12 incorrect flags. To improve, we could unflag some incorrect flags, but the problem might expect us to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 10 (original board) which is '?'. Its adjacent cells are (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=1. All are 1s. Each 1 has 8 adjacent cells, and if (3,10) is safe, then each 1 must have their mine in another cell. But all other adjacent cells to the 1s are uncovered (numbers), so the mine must be (3,10). So (3,10) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover it.\n\nAnother '?': row 4, column 7 (original board) is '?'. Adjacent cells are (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=1. All 1s. So (4,7) is a mine.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is '?'. Adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,0)=?, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=2. If (5,1) is a mine, then (4,0)=1 (needs 1 mine) is satisfied, (5,2)=1 (needs 1 mine) is satisfied. Then (6,2)=2 (needs 2 mines) would have (5,1) and another mine, maybe (6,1) or (7,2).\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a '?' that is likely safe. Let's look at row 3, column 10 (original) is a mine, row 4, column 7 is a mine. What about row 9, column 0 (original) which is '?'. It's in the top-left, far from numbers. Maybe it's safe. But without info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's adjacent to a 1 with only one '?'. For example, row 2, column 9=1 (original). Adjacent cells: (1,8)=0, (1,9)=0, (1,10)=0, (2,8)=1, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?. (2,9)=1 has one '?', which is (3,10). So (3,10) is a mine, as before.\n\nRow 2, column 10=1. Adjacent cells: (1,9)=0, (1,10)=0, (1,11)=0, (2,9)=1, (2,11)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?, (3,11)=1. (2,10)=1 has one '?', (3,10), so (3,10) is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 9=1. Adjacent cells: (2,8)=1, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,10)=?, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1. (3,9)=1 has one '?', (3,10), so (3,10) is a mine.\n\nSo (3,10) is definitely a mine. So we shouldn't uncover it.\n\nWhat about row 4, column 10=1 (original). Adjacent cells: (3,9)=1, (3,10)=?, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,11)=1, (5,9)=0, (5,10)=0, (5,11)=0. (4,10)=1 has one '?', (3,10), so (3,10) is a mine.\n\nSo (3,10) is a mine. Let's find a safe cell. Let's look at row 9, column 7=1 (original). Adjacent cells: (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,8)=1, (10,6)=1, (10,7)=1, (10,8)=?. (9,7)=1 has one '?', (10,8). So (10,8) is a mine.\n\nRow 10, column 7=1 (original). Adjacent cells: (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1, (9,8)=1, (10,6)=1, (10,8)=?, (11,6)=?, (11,7)=?, (11,8)=?. (10,7)=1 has one '?', (10,8), so (10,8) is a mine.\n\nRow 10, column 6=1 (original). Adjacent cells: (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=1, (10,5)=2, (10,7)=1, (11,5)=?, (11,6)=?, (11,7)=?. (10,6)=1 has two '?'s, (11,5), (11,6), (11,7). So not sure.\n\nLet's look for a cell with a number that has all adjacent mines flagged, so the remaining are safe. For example, row 0, column 2=2 (original). Adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2. So (0,2)=2 has two F's, which are (0,3) and (1,3). Since 2=2, those are the mines, so the other adjacent cells are safe. The other adjacent cells are all uncovered (0s and 2s), so no '?'s here.\n\nRow 1, column 2=2 (original). Same as row 0, column 2. Adjacent F's (0,3) and (1,3), so 2 mines, correct.\n\nRow 0, column 4=2 (original). Adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. (0,4)=2 has two F's, so those are the mines, so the other adjacent cells are safe. All adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 4=2 (original). Same as row 0, column 4. Adjacent F's (0,3) and (1,3), so 2 mines, correct.\n\nSo the F's at (0,3) and (1,3) are correct. The other 12 F's are incorrect. So we should unflag those, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the problem asks for an action, which could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's pick a '?' that is not a mine. Let's look at row 3, column 5=0 (original). All adjacent cells are safe, so any '?' adjacent to a 0 is safe. But there are no '?'s adjacent to 0s.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at the 100th epoch, so we need to make moves until then. Since the user has many incorrect flags, maybe the best move is to uncover a '?' that is likely safe. Let's pick a '?' in a region with low numbers. For example, row 3, column 10 is a mine, row 4, column 7 is a mine, row 10,8 is a mine. Let's pick a '?' that's not in these areas.\n\nLooking at the original board, row 3, column 10 is '?', row 4, column 7 is '?', row 5, column 1 is '?', row 6, columns 0-1 are '?', rows 7-8, columns 0-3 are '?', row 9, columns 0-4 are '?', row 10, columns 0-4 and 8-12 are '?', rows 11-12 are all '?'.\n\nLet's pick row 3, column 10: mine. Row 4, column 7: mine. Row 5, column 1: possible mine. Row 6, column 0: '?'. Let's check row 6, column 2=2 (original). Adjacent cells: (5,1)=?, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=?, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=?. (6,2)=2. So two mines in adjacent cells. If (5,1) and (6,1) are mines, then (6,2)=2 is satisfied. So (6,0) might be safe.\n\nLet's uncover row 6, column 0. Or row 7, column 0. Alternatively, row 9, column 0.\n\nBut without more info, it's a guess. However, in Minesweeper, the safest initial moves are in corners or edges, but since many cells are already uncovered, we need to find a '?' that's likely safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 9=1 (original) which has adjacent cell (3,9)=1. (3,9)=1 has adjacent cells (2,8)=1, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,10)=?, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=1, (4,10)=1. (3,9)=1 has one '?', which is a mine. So (3,10) is a mine. So we can't uncover that.\n\nAnother '?' is row 4, column 7 (original). As discussed, it's a mine.\n\nLet's pick row 5, column 5=0 (original). Adjacent cells are all safe, so no '?'s.\n\nRow 10, column 5=2 (original). Adjacent cells: (9,4)=?, (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=?, (10,6)=1, (11,4)=?, (11,5)=?, (11,6)=?. (10,5)=2. So two mines in adjacent cells. The '?'s are (9,4), (10,4), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). So two of these are mines.\n\nI think the best move is to uncover a '?' that's in a region with no nearby numbers, which are likely safe. For example, row 11, column 12 (bottom-right corner). But since the board is 13x13, maybe (11,12) is a safe cell. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 1 with multiple '?'s, so it's less likely to be a mine. For example, row 6, column 0 (original) is '?'. Its adjacent cells are (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (6,1)=?, (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?. So no numbers nearby, so it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the user's score is low, so maybe they have flagged some safe cells. Let's unflag one of the F's that's incorrect. For example, if there's an F in a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which can't be a mine. Let's check the F's. The F's are at (0,3) and (1,3) (original board rows 0 and 1, column 3). Are there other F's? The first two rows have \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" and \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so F's at (0,3) and (1,3). Are there more F's in other rows? The given board has:\n\nRow 0: ... F ...\nRow 1: ... F ...\nOther rows: no F's mentioned (since the rest are 0, 1, 2, or '?'). So the Flags: 2\/14 means 2 F's placed, 14 total mines? No, the problem says 10 mines. So maybe the F's are 2 placed, 14 is a typo. Or the board display is cut off.\n\nAssuming only two F's at (0,3) and (1,3), which are correct, then the user has 2 flags, 0 unflags. The score is 2\/10=0.2, but the given score is 0.142857. So maybe the board display is incorrect.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume that the best move is to uncover a '?' that is likely safe. Let's pick (3,10) but it's a mine. (4,7) is a mine. Let's pick (5,1) which might be a mine. Alternatively, (6,0) which is a '?'. Let's choose (6,0).\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (6,0)","uncover (6,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided the current board state, and I need to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell.\n\nFirst, let's recall the game rules. The board is 9x9, but the current board display here seems to have more rows and columns. Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check the input again. Oh, the user might have made a mistake in the board's row and column numbers. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shows 13 rows (0 to 12) and 13 columns (0 to 12). That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps I should proceed with the given data.\n\nThe score is 0.142857..., which is 1\/7, so they've correctly flagged 1 mine (since total mines are 10, 0.142857*10 ≈ 1.428, but the Flags are 2\/14, so 2 flagged, 14 total possible? Maybe the score is correct flags \/ total mines, so 2 correct out of 10 would be 0.2, but the score here is ~1\/7. Maybe the user's current state has 2 flags, 1 of which is correct, hence 1\/7 ≈ 0.1428. Anyway, maybe that's not critical right now.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the cells. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's index rows from 0 to 12 and columns 0 to 12, even though the problem says 9x9. Maybe it's a mistake, but we'll go with the given.\n\nLet's list some cells with '?' which are unknown. Our options are to uncover, flag, or unflag. Since unflags are 0, all flags are current, so maybe we don't need to unflag now unless a flag is wrong, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet.\n\nFirst, look for cells that can be logically determined as safe or mines.\n\nLet's take a cell with a number, say, row 2, column 9: value 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,8), (1,9), (1,10), (2,8), (2,10), (3,8), (3,9), (3,10). Let's check those. Row 2, col 9 is 1. Let's see the adjacent cells. For example, row 3, col 9 is '?', row 3, col 10 is '?', row 1, col 9 is 0 (row 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, so col 9 is 0). Row 2, col 8 is 1 (row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0, so col 8 is 1). Row 3, col 8 is 1 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0, col 8 is 1). So the 1 at (2,9) has adjacent cells. Let's count how many adjacent cells are already flagged or numbers. The 1 at (2,9) indicates there's 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. Let's list neighbors:\n\n(1,8): row 1, col 8 is 0 (from row 1: ...0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, wait row 1 is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", so columns 0-12. So row 1, col 8 is 0. (1,9): 0, (1,10): 0. (2,8): 1 (row 2, col 8 is 1). (2,10): 1 (row 2, col 10 is 1). (3,8): 1 (row 3, col 8 is 1). (3,9): '?', (3,10): '?'. So the 1 at (2,9) has two '?' cells: (3,9) and (3,10). Since the number is 1, exactly one of these two is a mine. But maybe other numbers can help.\n\nLooking at row 3, col 11: 1 (row 3: ...1 ? 1 0, so col 11 is 1). Its neighbors: (2,10), (2,11), (2,12), (3,10), (3,12), (4,10), (4,11), (4,12). (2,10) is 1, (2,11) is 1, (2,12) is 0. (3,10) is '?', (3,12) is 0. (4,10) is 1 (row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0, col 10 is 1), (4,11) is 1, (4,12) is 0. So the 1 at (3,11) has (3,10) as a neighbor. If (3,10) is a mine, that would satisfy the 1 here. But the 1 at (2,9) also has (3,10) as a neighbor. If (3,10) is a mine, then (3,9) is safe, and vice versa.\n\nAnother cell: row 4, col 7 is '?'. Let's look at row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0. So (4,7) is '?'. Its neighbors: (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6) is 1 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0), (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1. (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is 1. (5,6) is 1 (row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0), (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 1. So (4,7) is surrounded by 8 cells, all of which are 1. The number of adjacent mines for (4,7) would be the sum of mines in those 8 cells. But since all those cells are 1, that means each of those 1s has their own mine counts. For example, (3,7) is 1: its neighbors include (4,7). So if (4,7) is a mine, then (3,7) would have that as a mine, contributing to its count. But (3,7) is 1, so it has 1 mine in its neighbors. Let's check (3,7)'s neighbors: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,6) is 0 (row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0), (2,7) is 0, (2,8) is 1. (3,6) is 1, (3,8) is 1. (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is 1. (4,7) is '?'. So (3,7) is 1. The known numbers in (3,7)'s neighbors are 1 (2,8), 1 (3,6), 1 (3,8), 1 (4,6), 1 (4,8). The 0s are (2,6), (2,7). So the 1 at (3,7) must have exactly 1 mine in its neighbors. The only unknown is (4,7). So if (4,7) is a mine, that would make (3,7)'s count 1, which matches. But wait, (4,7) is also a neighbor to (4,6), which is 1. Let's check (4,6): row 4, col 6 is 1. Its neighbors: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5) is 0 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0), (3,6) is 1, (3,7) is 1. (4,5) is 0, (4,7) is '?'. (5,5) is 0 (row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0), (5,6) is 1, (5,7) is 1. So (4,6) is 1. The known numbers: (3,6)=1, (3,7)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. The 0s are (3,5), (4,5), (5,5). So the 1 at (4,6) has 1 mine in its neighbors. The unknown is (4,7). So if (4,7) is a mine, that would make (4,6)'s count 1. So both (3,7) and (4,6) are 1, and their only unknown neighbor is (4,7). So (4,7) must be a mine. Wait, but if (4,7) is a mine, then (3,7) has 1 mine (correct), (4,6) has 1 mine (correct). That seems to fit. So (4,7) is a mine. Should we flag it? But let's confirm.\n\nAnother angle: row 5, col 1 is '?'. Let's see row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0. (5,1) is '?'. Its neighbors: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0) is 1 (row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0), (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. (5,0) is 1, (5,2) is 1. (6,0) is 1 (row 6: 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (6,1) is 1, (6,2) is 2. So (5,1) is surrounded by 1s and a 2. Let's check (6,2) which is 2. Its neighbors include (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,2) is 1, (5,3) is 0. (6,1) is 1, (6,3) is 1. (7,1) is 0 (row 7: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (7,2) is 1, (7,3) is '?'. So (6,2) is 2, meaning 2 mines in its neighbors. Known cells: (5,2)=1 (which is a number, not a mine), (5,3)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)='?'. So the possible mines here are (7,3) and (5,1). Since (6,2) is 2, maybe (5,1) and (7,3) are mines. But (5,1) is a '?', and (7,3) is '?'. Not sure yet.\n\nLet's look for a cell that's definitely safe. For example, row 3, col 5 is 0 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0). A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. So all 8 neighbors of (3,5) are safe. Let's list them: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) is 1 (row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0), (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 0. (3,4) is 0, (3,6) is 1. (4,4) is 0 (row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0), (4,5) is 0, (4,6) is 1. All these are numbers, not '?', so 0 at (3,5) is correct, no mines around. So nothing new there.\n\nAnother 0: row 1, col 5 is 0 (row 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). So (1,5) is 0. Its neighbors: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (0,4) is 2 (row 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (0,5) is 0, (0,6) is 0. (1,4) is 2, (1,6) is 0. (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 0. All are numbers, so 0 is correct.\n\nLooking at row 7, col 3: '?'. Row 7 is 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. (7,3) is '?'. Its neighbors: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2) is 2 (row 6: 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (6,3) is 1, (6,4) is 1. (7,2) is 1, (7,4) is 1. (8,2) is 2 (row 8: 0 0 2 ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (8,3) is '?', (8,4) is 3. So (7,3) is adjacent to (6,2)=2, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=2, (8,3)='?', (8,4)=3. The 2 at (6,2) has (7,3) as a neighbor. (6,2) is 2, so 2 mines in its neighbors. We already saw that (6,2)'s neighbors include (5,1), (5,2)=1, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)='?'. So (6,2) has 2 mines, possibly (5,1) and (7,3).\n\nRow 8, col 3 is '?', row 8 is 0 0 2 ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. (8,3) is '?'. Its neighbors: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,2)=1, (7,3)='?', (7,4)=1. (8,2)=2, (8,4)=3. (9,2)=1 (row 9: 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1), (9,3)='?', (9,4)='?'. The 3 at (8,4) is a high number. Let's check (8,4)=3. Its neighbors: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0 (row 7: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (8,3)='?', (8,5)=1. (9,3)='?', (9,4)='?', (9,5)=1 (row 9: ...? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1). So (8,4)=3 has 3 mines in its neighbors. The unknowns here are (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (9,4). So 3 mines among these four. That's a lot, but maybe not helpful yet.\n\nLet's think about cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a number cell has all its required mines already flagged, then the remaining adjacent '?' are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, col 2: 2 (row 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). (0,2)=2. Its neighbors: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F (flagged), (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F (row 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). So (0,2)=2 has two flagged cells (0,3) and (1,3). Since the number is 2, that means these two flags are the mines. So the adjacent cells to (0,2) are all accounted for. So any other adjacent cells (but (0,2) is at (0,2), neighbors are ( -1,1) invalid, ( -1,2) invalid, ( -1,3) invalid, (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F). So (0,2)=2 has exactly two mines (the flags), so those flags are correct. That might explain the score: if these two flags are correct, but total mines are 10, 2\/10=0.2, but the score is 0.142857 which is 1\/7. Maybe one of these flags is incorrect. Wait, the problem says the score is correctly flagged mines \/ total mines. So if 2 are flagged, and 1 is correct, 1\/10=0.1, but 0.1428 is 1\/7. Maybe the total mines in the current state considered is 7? Not sure. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Anyway, perhaps the F at (0,3) and (1,3) are incorrect. Let's check (0,3)=F. The cell (0,3) is flagged. Let's see its neighbor (0,2)=2. If (0,3) is a mine, then (0,2)=2 needs another mine in its neighbors. The other neighbor is (1,3)=F. So (1,3) is also a mine. So (0,2)=2 has two mines, which are (0,3) and (1,3). That would make those two flags correct. Then why is the score 0.1428? Maybe there are 7 total mines in the current visible area, but the problem states 10 hidden mines. Maybe the user's input has errors, but we have to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Since 0 means no mines around, any '?' adjacent to a 0 is safe. Let's check for 0 cells. For example, row 3, col 5 is 0. Its neighbors are all safe, but they are already uncovered. Row 1, col 5 is 0, neighbors are uncovered. Row 0, col 5 is 0 (row 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), so (0,5)=0. Its neighbors are (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, col 0 is 0 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0). (3,0)=0. Its neighbors: (2,-1) invalid, (2,0)=0 (row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0), (2,1)=0, (3,-1) invalid, (3,1)=0, (4,-1) invalid, (4,0)=1 (row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0), (4,1)=1. All safe, no '?'.\n\nRow 4, col 3 is 0 (row 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 0). (4,3)=0. Its neighbors: (3,2)=0 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0), (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1 (row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0), (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, col 3 is 0 (row 5: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0). (5,3)=0. Its neighbors: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=2 (row 6: 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, col 5 is 0 (row 6: 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). (6,5)=0. Its neighbors: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1 (row 7: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, col 5 is 0 (row 7: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). (7,5)=0. Its neighbors: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3 (row 8: 0 0 2 ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, col 5 is 1 (row 8: 0 0 2 ? 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0). (8,5)=1. Its neighbors: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=0, (9,4)='?', (9,5)=1 (row 9: 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1), (9,6)=0. So (8,5)=1 has 1 mine in neighbors. The unknown is (9,4). If (9,4) is a mine, that would make (8,5)=1 correct.\n\nRow 9, col 5 is 1 (row 9: 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1). (9,5)=1. Its neighbors: (8,4)=3, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)='?', (9,6)=0, (10,4)='?', (10,5)=2, (10,6)=1 (row 10: 0 0 1 2 ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?). So (9,5)=1 has 1 mine in neighbors. The unknowns are (9,4) and (10,4). If (9,4) is a mine, that would satisfy (9,5)=1.\n\nRow 10, col 5 is 2 (row 10: 0 0 1 2 ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?). (10,5)=2. Its neighbors: (9,4)='?', (9,5)=1, (9,6)=0, (10,4)='?', (10,6)=1, (11,4)='?', (11,5)='?', (11,6)='?'. So (10,5)=2 has 2 mines in neighbors. The unknowns here are (9,4), (10,4), (11,4), (11,5), (11,6). Not sure.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number where the number of adjacent '?' equals the number. For example, if a cell has number 1 and only one '?' adjacent, then that '?' is a mine. Or if a cell has number 0, all adjacent '?' are safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, col 8 is 1 (row 2: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0). (2,8)=1. Its neighbors: (1,7)=0 (row 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0), (1,8)=0, (1,9)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=1, (3,7)=1 (row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0), (3,8)=1, (3,9)='?'. So (2,8)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. The known numbers: (2,9)=1, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1. The 0s: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7). The only '?' is (3,9). So (3,9) must be the mine. Because the number is 1, and there's only one '?' adjacent, so (3,9) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,9). But wait, let's confirm. (2,8)=1, neighbors are 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(1,7): 0 (safe)\n(1,8): 0 (safe)\n(1,9): 0 (safe)\n(2,7): 0 (safe)\n(2,9): 1 (safe, since it's a number)\n(3,7): 1 (safe)\n(3,8): 1 (safe)\n(3,9): '?' (unknown)\n\nSo out of 8 neighbors, 7 are safe (numbers or 0), so the 1 mine must be (3,9). Therefore, (3,9) is a mine. So we should flag (3,9).\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,9) in row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? 1 0. (3,9) is '?'. Its neighbor (2,8)=1 requires it to be a mine. So yes, (3,9) should be flagged.\n\nBut wait, the user's current flags are 2\/14. Maybe they have 2 flags, and we need to add another. But let's confirm.\n\nAnother cell: row 3, col 10 is '?'. (3,10) is in row 3: ...1 ? 1 0. Its neighbor (2,9)=1 (row 2: ...0 1 1 1 0). (2,9)=1's neighbors include (3,9) and (3,10). We determined (3,9) is a mine, so (3,10) must be safe. Because (2,9)=1 has two '?' neighbors, (3,9) and (3,10). If (3,9) is a mine, then (3,10) is safe. So (3,10) can be uncovered safely.\n\nYes! That's a key point. (2,9)=1 has two '?' neighbors: (3,9) and (3,10). We determined (3,9) is a mine (because (2,8)=1 has only (3,9) as '?'), so (2,9)=1's mine count is 1, which is (3,9). Therefore, (3,10) must be safe. So we can uncover (3,10).\n\nLet's verify:\n\n- (2,8)=1 has 7 safe neighbors and 1 '?', so (3,9) is a mine.\n- (2,9)=1 has neighbors (3,9) (mine) and (3,10) (unknown). Since (2,9)=1, it needs 1 mine, which is (3,9). Therefore, (3,10) is safe.\n\nTherefore, uncovering (3,10) is safe. That's a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,10)","uncover (3,10)"],"unflags":0,"seed":3,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to play Minesweeper. The board is 9x9, but wait, the current board shown has 20 rows? That might be a typo, but probably it's a 9x9 grid. The initial state is all '?', so nothing is uncovered yet. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines. Since it's the first move, the best strategy is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. Usually, in Minesweeper, the first move is safe, and it uncovers a large area. Let's pick a cell in the middle, maybe (4,4) to start. But maybe a corner is better? Wait, no, corners have fewer adjacent cells, but the first move is safe, so any cell is fine. Let's go with (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but (0,0) is a corner. Alternatively, (4,4) is the center. Let's choose (4,4). So the action should be 'uncover (4,4)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 20x20 grid, but wait, Minesweeper is typically 9x9. Maybe that's a formatting error, but I'll focus on the given data.\n\nLooking at the current board, there are cells marked with numbers, '?', and some 'F's (but the Flags count is 0\/11, so no F's yet). The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly. The score is based on correct flags over total mines (10).\n\nFirst, I need to recall that in Minesweeper, a number in a cell indicates how many mines are adjacent. '?' means unknown, 'F' is a flagged mine. The game ends if a mine is uncovered, or at 100 epochs. The win condition is flagging all mines or uncovering all safe cells.\n\nLet's look for cells that can be logically determined. For example, a cell with '1' that has only one adjacent '?' must be a mine. Or a cell with a number equal to the number of adjacent 'F's, so the remaining '?' are safe.\n\nLooking at the current board (assuming rows are 0-19 and columns 0-19, but maybe it's a typo and should be 9x9, but the input shows 20 columns). Let's pick a section. For example, row 3, column 2 is '1'. Adjacent cells: let's see row 3, column 1 is '?', row 3, column 3 is '0'. The '1' at (3,2) has adjacent cells. Let's list adjacent cells for (3,2): (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The cell (3,2) is '1', so one mine in those 8. The cell (3,1) is '?', (4,1) is '1', (4,2) is '2', (4,3) is '1'. (2,1) is '1', (2,2) is '1', (2,3) is '0'. (3,3) is '0'. So adjacent to (3,2) are (3,1) '?', (2,1) '1', (2,2) '1', (2,3) '0', (3,3) '0', (4,1) '1', (4,2) '2', (4,3) '1'. None of these are 'F's, so the '1' at (3,2) must have one mine in adjacent '?'. The only '?' adjacent is (3,1). So (3,1) is a mine? Wait, but if (3,2) is '1', and adjacent to (3,1) '?', and others are numbers (which are safe, as they are uncovered), then the mine must be in (3,1). So maybe (3,1) is a mine. But I need to check other cells.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '0' cell. A '0' means no adjacent mines, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. If I uncover a '0', all adjacent '?' can be automatically uncovered. Let's find a '0' that has adjacent '?'. For example, row 2, column 3 is '0'. Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (2,3) is '0', so all adjacent cells are safe. Let's check those cells: (3,4) is '?'. So (3,4) is adjacent to a '0' (row 2, column 3), so (3,4) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (3,4) is safe because the '0' at (2,3) indicates no mines around, so (3,4) can be safely uncovered. That's a good move. Let's confirm: (2,3) is 0, so (3,4) is adjacent (since (2,3) is row 2, column 3, (3,4) is row 3, column 4: down one, right one, which is adjacent). So (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3) which is 0, so (3,4) has no mine. Therefore, uncovering (3,4) is safe. That's a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the way it's displayed here is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board? Because 9x9 should have 9 rows, but here there are 20 rows. Oh, maybe that's a typo. Let me check the input again. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so probably the current board display is a mistake, but maybe each row is a line here. Let's assume that each line is a row of the 9x9 grid, so rows 0 to 8. Let's list the rows properly.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → Maybe this is a mistake. Wait, the actual Minesweeper board should have cells that are either '?', numbers, or 'F'. The given board has a lot of 0s, which might represent uncovered safe cells with 0 adjacent mines. Let's parse the current board correctly.\n\nLooking at the problem statement's point 4: the blocks can be '?', a number (indicating adjacent mines), or 'F'. So the 0s here are uncovered cells with 0 adjacent mines. So rows 0-8 (since 9x9) might be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (assuming the first 9 elements)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 (wait, 9 columns, so maybe up to index 8)\nWait, maybe the user's board display is a formatting error, but perhaps the key is to look for '?' which are unknown cells. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines.\n\nThe win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10. Current flags are 0\/11 (maybe a typo, should be 0\/10). Let's focus on the '?' cells, which are unknown. We need to decide whether to uncover a '?' (assuming it's safe) or flag it (if it's a mine).\n\nLooking at the board, let's list the positions of '?':\n\nFrom the given board lines (assuming each line is a row, and columns 0-8):\n\nRow 3: columns 0,1 → (3,0), (3,1)\nRow 3: column 15 is '?', but maybe that's a mistake. Wait, the original input's current board is written as 20 columns per row, which is wrong. This is probably a formatting error. Let's assume that the board is 9x9, and the '?' are in positions like (3,0), (3,1), (3,15) is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to represent the board with each row being 9 cells, but the way it's written is split. Alternatively, perhaps the '?' positions are:\n\nLooking at the given Current Board:\n\nLine 3 (assuming 0-based): \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → So here, columns 0,1,15 are '?'. But 9x9 grid would have columns 0-8, so column 15 is out of bounds. This must be a mistake. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the '?' are in valid coordinates. Let's try to find valid (row, col) where row and col are 0-8.\n\nLooking for '?' in the given lines:\n\nLine 3: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → Assuming this is row 3. The first two '?' are at (3,0) and (3,1). The next '?' is at column 15, which is invalid, so ignore.\n\nLine 4: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → No '?'\n\nLine 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → '?' at (5,2)\n\nLine 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" → '?' at (7,8) (since column 8 is the 9th element, 0-based)\n\nLine 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" → '?' at (8,17) which is invalid, but maybe (8,7) if the 8th column is the 8th index. Wait, line 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" → the '?' is at position 17, which is column 17, invalid. So maybe (8,7) is 1, (8,8) is 1? No.\n\nLine 10: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → '?' at (10,0), (10,1) but row 10 is beyond 8 (9x9), so invalid.\n\nLine 11: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → same, row 11 invalid.\n\nLine 12: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → row 12 invalid.\n\nLine 13: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\" → row 13 invalid.\n\nLine 14: \"1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\" → row 14 invalid, '?' at column 19.\n\nLine 15: \"0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\" → row 15 invalid, '?' at column 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. The user probably made a mistake in formatting the board. Since the game is 9x9, rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's focus on the '?' that are in valid coordinates. Let's re-express the board correctly. Maybe the user pasted the board with extra columns, but the actual 9x9 is the first 9 columns of each row. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → (0,0)-(0,8) are 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → all 0s.\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, rest 0.\n\nRow 3: ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=1, rest 0.\n\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 → (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=1, rest 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 → (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=1, rest 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 → (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? → (7,0)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=? (since 9 columns, 0-8).\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 → (8,0)=0, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1.\n\nThat makes a 9x9 grid. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: ['?','?',1,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,1,'?',1,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 6: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,'?']\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1]\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, let's look at the '?' positions: (3,0), (3,1), (5,2), (7,8). These are the unknown cells. Now, we need to determine which of these are safe to uncover or which are mines to flag.\n\nLet's analyze each '?'.\n\nFirst, (3,0):\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,0) are:\n\nRow 2, columns 0-1 (since row 3-1=2, columns 0-1 (0-1, 0, 0+1=1)), and row 4, columns 0-1.\n\nSo adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2.\n\nThe cell (3,0) is unknown. Let's see the cell (2,0)=1, which is an uncovered cell with 1 adjacent mine. The adjacent cells of (2,0) are:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\n(2,0) has value 1, meaning exactly 1 mine in those 7 cells.\n\nWe know (1,0)=0 (uncovered, safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (uncovered, safe), (3,2)=1 (uncovered, safe). So the adjacent cells of (2,0) that are unknown are (3,0) and (3,1). So (2,0)=1 implies that exactly 1 of (3,0) or (3,1) is a mine.\n\nNow, look at (2,1)=1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\n(2,1) has value 1. Known safe cells here: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (2,0)=1 (safe), (2,2)=1 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So unknown cells are (3,0) and (3,1). So (2,1)=1 also implies exactly 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1). Which matches the previous conclusion.\n\nNow, (2,2)=1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\n(2,2)=1. Known safe cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0 (row 1, column 3 is 0), (2,1)=1 (safe), (2,3)=0 (row 2, column 3 is 0), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=0 (row 3, column 3 is 0). So unknown cells here are (3,1). So (2,2)=1 implies that (3,1) is either a mine or not. Wait, the adjacent cells of (2,2) include (3,1). Since (2,2)=1, and all other adjacent cells are safe (0 or uncovered numbers), then (3,1) must be a mine? Because if (3,1) is safe, then (2,2) would have 0 adjacent mines, but it's 1. Let's check:\n\nAdjacent cells of (2,2) (row 2, column 2):\n\n- (1,1): 0 (safe)\n- (1,2): 0 (safe)\n- (1,3): 0 (row 1, column 3 is 0)\n- (2,1): 1 (safe)\n- (2,3): 0 (row 2, column 3 is 0)\n- (3,1): ? (unknown)\n- (3,2): 1 (safe)\n- (3,3): 0 (row 3, column 3 is 0)\n\nSo the only possible mine adjacent to (2,2) is (3,1). Since (2,2) has a value of 1, that means there's exactly 1 mine in these 8 cells. All others are safe, so (3,1) must be a mine. Therefore, (3,1) is a mine. Then, from (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1, which both require exactly 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1), and since (3,1) is a mine, (3,0) must be safe.\n\nSo (3,0) can be uncovered safely.\n\nNext, (5,2): Let's check its adjacent cells. (5,2) is in row 5, column 2.\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3).\n\n(4,1)=2 (uncovered), (4,2)=2 (uncovered), (4,3)=1 (uncovered), (5,1)=1 (uncovered), (5,3)=1 (uncovered), (6,1)=1 (uncovered), (6,2)=1 (uncovered), (6,3)=1 (uncovered).\n\nThe cell (5,2) is '?'. Let's see the value of (4,2)=2. (4,2) is at row 4, column 2, value 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nWe know (3,1) is a mine (from earlier), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=0 (safe), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (5,1)=1 (safe), (5,3)=1 (safe). So (4,2)=2 has adjacent mines: (3,1) is a mine. So how many mines are adjacent to (4,2)? The value is 2, so there should be 2 mines. So far, we have (3,1) as a mine. The other mine must be (5,2), because that's the only unknown adjacent cell. So (5,2) is a mine.\n\nThen, (5,1)=1. (5,1) is at row 5, column 1, value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2).\n\n(4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (5,2)=? (unknown), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=1 (safe), (6,2)=1 (safe). So (5,1)=1's adjacent mines: we know (3,1) is a mine, but (3,1) is not adjacent to (5,1). The adjacent cells of (5,1) include (5,2). If (5,2) is a mine (as per (4,2)=2), then (5,1)=1 would have exactly 1 mine (5,2), which matches. So that confirms (5,2) is a mine.\n\nNext, (7,8): row 7, column 8.\n\nAdjacent cells are (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8).\n\n(6,7)=1 (uncovered), (6,8)=1 (uncovered), (7,7)=1 (uncovered), (8,7)=1 (uncovered), (8,8)=1 (uncovered).\n\nCheck (6,8)=1. Its adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (6,9) (invalid), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9) (invalid), (8,8).\n\nValid cells: (5,7)=0 (row 5, column 7 is 0), (5,8)=0 (row 5, column 8 is 0), (6,7)=1 (safe), (7,7)=1 (safe), (7,8)=? (unknown), (8,8)=1 (safe). So (6,8)=1's adjacent mines: only (7,8) could be a mine. Since (6,8)=1, there's 1 mine adjacent, so (7,8) must be a mine.\n\nWait, (6,8)=1: adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (8,8). Let's list all 8 adjacent cells for (6,8):\n\nRow 5: columns 7,8 → (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0.\n\nRow 6: columns 7,9 (invalid) → (6,7)=1.\n\nRow 7: columns 7,8 → (7,7)=1, (7,8)=?.\n\nRow 8: columns 7,8 → (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1.\n\nSo the 8 adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (8,8). All of these except (7,8) are uncovered and safe (0 or numbers). So (6,8)=1 must have exactly 1 mine in these cells, which must be (7,8). Therefore, (7,8) is a mine.\n\nSo summarizing:\n\n- (3,1) is a mine → should be flagged.\n\n- (5,2) is a mine → should be flagged.\n\n- (7,8) is a mine → should be flagged.\n\n- (3,0) is safe → can be uncovered.\n\nSince the current action is to choose between uncover, flag, or unflag. The user's current flags are 0, so we can flag the mines we identified. But let's confirm if there are 10 mines total. We've identified 3 so far. But maybe we need to uncover a safe cell first.\n\nThe user's score is 0.0, flags 0\/11 (probably 0\/10). The goal is to flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. Since we found that (3,0) is safe, uncovering it would be a good move. Let's verify (3,0) again.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, (2,0)=1 has adjacent cells including (3,0) and (3,1). We determined (3,1) is a mine, so (3,0) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (3,0) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the given current board seems to have 20 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Oh, probably each row is written as a line with 20 characters, but the actual grid is 9x9. Let me check the coordinates. The user mentioned the top-left is (0,0), so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nLooking at the input, the current board has rows with numbers, '?', and 'F' (but there are no F's mentioned in the flags, which are 0\/11). The score is 0.0, so no correct flags yet. The game ends at 100 epochs or uncovering a mine. The win condition is correctly flagging all 10 mines or uncovering all safe cells.\n\nLet me parse the current board. Let's list the rows properly. Maybe each line is a row of the 9x9 grid. Let's index rows 0 to 8 and columns 0 to 8. Let's look for cells with '?', which are unknown. The goal is to either uncover safe cells or flag mines.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells with numbers that can help deduce mines. For example, a cell with a number 1 that has only one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 0: All 0s? Maybe it's a row of 0s, meaning no adjacent mines. So all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow 1: Same as row 0, all 0s.\n\nRow 2: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" – probably the first three columns are 1,1,1, then 0s. So row 2, columns 0-2 are 1s. Let's focus on row 3: \"1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – row 3, columns 0:1, column1:?, column2:1, column3:0, etc. Columns 14:1, 15:?, 16:1. But since it's 9x9, maybe columns 0-8. So row 3, columns 0:1, 1:?, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0.\n\nRow 4: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" – row 4, columns 0:1, 1:2, 2:2, 3:1, rest 0s.\n\nRow 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – row 5, column 2:?\n\nRow 6: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – row 6, columns 1-3:1s, columns 7-9:1s (but 9 is beyond 8, so 7-8:1s)\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" – row 7, column 8:? (since 9 is 1, column 8 is ?)\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" – row 8, column 17:? (but 9x9, so column 8 is 1, column 7:1, column 8:1? Maybe the input is misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps the current board is presented as a 20x20 grid, but the actual Minesweeper is 9x9. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and the rows are 9 cells each. Let's assume that each row in the current board is a 9-character row, separated by spaces. Let's re-express the current board correctly:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\nThat makes more sense. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: all 0s (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: all 0s\nRow 2: columns 0-2 are 1, rest 0\nRow 3: column 0:1, column1:?, column2:1, rest 0\nRow 4: column0:1, column1:2, column2:2, column3:1, rest 0\nRow 5: column1:1, column2:?, column3:1, rest 0\nRow 6: column1-3:1, columns7-8:1\nRow 7: column7:1, column8:?, rest 0\nRow 8: column7-8:1, rest 0\n\nNow, let's analyze the '?' cells. The '?' are in:\n\nRow 3, column1 (3,1)\nRow 5, column2 (5,2)\nRow 7, column8 (7,8)\n\nLet's check each of these to see if they must be mines or safe.\n\nFirst, (3,1): Let's look at the adjacent cells. The cell (3,1) is surrounded by cells with numbers. Let's find the number cells that have (3,1) as an adjacent cell.\n\nLooking at (2,0) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (2,0) is 1, so one mine in those 5 cells. (1,0) and (1,1) are 0 (row1 is all 0s), (2,1) is 1 (row2, column1 is 1), (3,0) is 1 (row3, column0 is 1). Wait, (2,0) is 1, which means one mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (2,0) are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). All of these except (3,1) are uncovered and are 0 or numbers. (1,0) is 0 (row1, column0 is 0), (1,1) is 0 (row1, column1 is 0), (2,1) is 1 (row2, column1 is 1, which is a number, so safe), (3,0) is 1 (row3, column0 is 1, safe). So the only unknown adjacent cell is (3,1). Since (2,0) has 1 mine, (3,1) must be a mine. Wait, no: (2,0) is a number, which indicates the count of mines in its adjacent cells. So (2,0) is 1, so among its 8 adjacent cells (wait, 8, not 5, because it's a corner? Wait, (2,0) is in row2, column0. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). Because it's on the top-left edge, so only 5 adjacent cells. All of these except (3,1) are uncovered. (1,0) is 0 (safe), (1,1) is 0 (safe), (2,1) is 1 (safe), (3,0) is 1 (safe). So the only adjacent cell that's unknown is (3,1). Since (2,0) has 1 mine, that mine must be (3,1). So (3,1) is a mine.\n\nWait, but let's check another cell that includes (3,1). Let's look at (3,2), which is 1. (3,2) is in row3, column2. Its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Let's list their states:\n\n(2,1): 1 (row2, column1 is 1, safe)\n(2,2): 1 (row2, column2 is 1, safe)\n(2,3): 0 (row2, column3 is 0, safe)\n(3,1): ? (unknown)\n(3,3): 0 (row3, column3 is 0, safe)\n(4,1): 2 (row4, column1 is 2, safe)\n(4,2): 2 (row4, column2 is 2, safe)\n(4,3): 1 (row4, column3 is 1, safe)\n\nSo (3,2) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. All except (3,1) are safe, so (3,1) must be the mine. That confirms (3,1) is a mine. So we should flag (3,1).\n\nNext, (5,2): Let's check the adjacent cells. (5,2) is in row5, column2. Let's look at surrounding numbers. For example, (4,1) is 2. (4,1) is row4, column1. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). Let's check:\n\n(3,0):1 (safe)\n(3,1):? (we think it's a mine)\n(3,2):1 (safe)\n(4,0):1 (safe)\n(4,2):2 (safe)\n(5,0):0 (row5, column0 is 0, safe)\n(5,1):1 (row5, column1 is 1, safe)\n(5,2):? (unknown)\n\n(4,1) is 2, so there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. We already think (3,1) is a mine. So if (3,1) is a mine, then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The remaining unknown is (5,2). So (4,1) has 2 mines: (3,1) and (5,2). Let's check another cell. (5,1) is 1 (row5, column1). Its adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (5,1) is 1, so 1 mine in those cells. Let's list:\n\n(4,0):1 (safe)\n(4,1):2 (safe)\n(4,2):2 (safe)\n(5,0):0 (safe)\n(5,2):? (unknown)\n(6,0):0 (row6, column0 is 0, safe)\n(6,1):1 (row6, column1 is 1, safe)\n(6,2):1 (row6, column2 is 1, safe)\n\nSo (5,1) has 1 mine, which must be (5,2). Because all others are safe. So (5,2) is a mine. So we should flag (5,2).\n\nNext, (7,8): (7,8) is in row7, column8. Let's check adjacent cells. (6,7) is 1 (row6, column7 is 1). (6,7)'s adjacent cells are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). Let's see:\n\n(5,6):0 (row5, column6 is 0, safe)\n(5,7):0 (row5, column7 is 0, safe)\n(5,8):0 (row5, column8 is 0, safe)\n(6,6):0 (row6, column6 is 0, safe)\n(6,8):1 (row6, column8 is 1, safe)\n(7,6):0 (row7, column6 is 0, safe)\n(7,7):1 (row7, column7 is 1, safe)\n(7,8):? (unknown)\n\n(6,7) is 1, so 1 mine in these 8 cells. All except (7,8) are safe, so (7,8) must be a mine. Also, (7,7) is 1 (row7, column7). Its adjacent cells are (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (7,7) is 1, so 1 mine here. (6,6):0, (6,7):1, (6,8):1, (7,6):0, (8,6):0 (row8, column6 is 0), (8,7):1 (row8, column7 is 1), (8,8):1 (row8, column8 is 1). So the only unknown is (7,8), which must be the mine. So (7,8) is a mine. So we should flag (7,8).\n\nWait, but the problem says there are 10 mines. So far, we found 3. But maybe there are other '?' cells. Let me check again. The current board as I parsed has three '?', but maybe I missed some. Let me re-examine the original current board:\n\nOriginal current board lines:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\nRow 9: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\nRow 10: ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: ? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 14: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\nRow 15: 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 16: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAh, I see! The user probably pasted the board as a 20x20 grid, but the actual Minesweeper is 9x9. That's a mistake. So the coordinates (row, col) are 0-8 for both. But the given board has 20 rows, which is incorrect. However, the input format says the board is 9x9, so maybe the current board is misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a formatting error, and the rows are 9 columns each, with the rest being padding. Let's assume that the relevant part is rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's re-express the board correctly by taking the first 9 columns of the first 9 rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 2: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] (columns 0-2 are 1, rest 0)\nRow 3: [1,?,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] (column1 is ?)\nRow 4: [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 5: [0,1,?,1,0,0,0,0,0] (column2 is ?)\nRow 6: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1] (columns7-8 are 1)\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?] (column8 is ?)\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1] (columns7-8 are 1)\n\nThat's 9 rows, 9 columns. Now, the '?' cells are at (3,1), (5,2), (7,8). As before.\n\nNow, let's confirm if these '?' are mines. For (3,1):\n\nAdjacent to (2,0)=1: adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). All are uncovered except (3,1). Since (2,0)=1, (3,1) must be a mine.\n\nAdjacent to (3,2)=1: adjacent cells include (3,1). (3,2) has 1 mine, and (3,1) is the only unknown, so it's a mine.\n\nFor (5,2):\n\nAdjacent to (4,1)=2: adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). We know (3,1) is a mine (from earlier), so (4,1) has 2 mines, so (5,2) must be the second mine.\n\nAdjacent to (5,1)=1: adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). All are safe except (5,2), so (5,2) is a mine.\n\nFor (7,8):\n\nAdjacent to (6,7)=1: adjacent cells are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). All are safe except (7,8), so (7,8) is a mine.\n\nAdjacent to (7,7)=1: adjacent cells are (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). All are safe except (7,8), so (7,8) is a mine.\n\nSo these three '?' are mines. We should flag them. But the current flags are 0\/11. Wait, the problem says there are 10 mines. So there are 10 mines in total, and the user has flagged 0 so far. So flagging these three would increase the correct flags.\n\nBut maybe there are other '?' cells in the 9x9 grid. Let's check the original current board again, perhaps I missed some. For example, row3 has \"1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – maybe columns 15 is also a '?', which would be (3,15) but that's beyond 8. So probably not part of the 9x9 grid. The same with row7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" – column8 is '?', which is (7,8) in 9x9.\n\nSo the three '?' in the 9x9 grid are (3,1), (5,2), (7,8). All are mines. So the action should be to flag one of them. Let's pick (3,1) first.\n\n\n\nAnswer: flag (3,1)","flag (3,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.0909, which is 1\/11, so there's 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged cells. That means most of the flags are incorrect. The game ends at the 100th epoch or if a mine is uncovered, so we need to make moves that uncover safe cells or correctly flag mines.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the coordinates. The board is 9x9, but the way it's displayed here might be a formatting issue. Wait, the user probably pasted the board with rows and columns. Let's check the rows. Each row is listed with numbers, probably columns 0-8. Let's correct the board structure. The first row is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" but that's probably a mistake. Maybe it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, each with columns 0-8. Let's focus on the rows that have meaningful data.\n\nLooking at row 3 (since in Minesweeper, rows are 0-based), the 4th element (column 4) is in row 3, column 4. The current board shows row 3 as \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — wait, maybe the columns are 0-8, so each row should have 9 elements. The user might have pasted the board with extra spaces, but perhaps each row is 9 cells. Let's adjust. For example, row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" (columns 0-8). Wait, maybe the actual board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, so row 0 has 9 cells, row 1 has 9, etc. Let's check the example input: 'uncover (3,4)' would be row 3, column 4.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: in the given board, row 3 is \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — perhaps the user made a formatting error, but let's focus on the cells that have '?', 'F', or numbers. The '?' are unknown cells, 'F' are flagged. The numbers indicate adjacent mines.\n\nThe user's task is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag. Since the current flags are 1\/11 correct, we might need to unflag some incorrect flags, but maybe better to uncover safe cells first.\n\nLet's look for cells that can be determined as safe. For example, if a numbered cell has all adjacent mines accounted for by flags, the remaining adjacent '?' are safe. Alternatively, if a numbered cell has more adjacent '?' than the number, some are safe.\n\nLet's take row 2 (assuming 0-based), which has \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — maybe row 2, column 0 is 1, column 1 is 1, column 2 is 1, column 3 is 0, etc. Let's focus on a cell with a number and adjacent '?'. For example, row 3, column 5 is '?'. The cell above it (row 2, column 5) is 0. A 0 means no adjacent mines, so all 8 surrounding cells are safe. Wait, row 2, column 3 is 0. So row 2, column 3 (0) implies that all adjacent cells (row 1,2,3; columns 2,3,4) are safe. Let's check: row 2, column 3 is 0. Its adjacent cells would be row 1 columns 2-4, row 2 columns 2-4, row 3 columns 2-4. If row 2, column 3 is 0, those cells are all safe. Let's see row 3, column 3 is 0 (from row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0...\"), so that's safe. Row 3, column 4 is 0, which is safe. So uncovering row 3, column 4 (which is 0) would be safe because it's adjacent to a 0 cell. Since 0 cells mean all adjacent are safe, uncovering them will reveal more 0s or numbers, which can help.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 3, column 4: the cell at (3,4) is 0. Since 0 means no mines around, uncovering it would reveal 0, and then all adjacent cells would also be safe. So that's a good move. Let's confirm: the cell (3,4) is in a 0 area, so it's safe. Uncovering it would help reveal more of the board.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided the current board, but wait, the rows and columns are a bit confusing. The problem says it's a 9x9 grid, but the board here is shown as 20 rows each with 20 columns? That might be a formatting error. Maybe it's a typo, and the actual board is 9x9. Let me check the input again.\n\nLooking at the problem statement: \"The board is a 9x9 grid with 10 hidden mines.\" So the 20x20 grid shown must be a mistake. Probably, each line represents a row, and each number\/character is a cell. Let's assume the rows are 0-8 (9 rows) and columns 0-8 (9 columns). Let's parse the current board correctly.\n\nWait, the user's Current Board has 20 lines, each with 20 entries. That's definitely a formatting issue. Maybe it's a copy-paste error. Let's try to focus on the relevant parts. The user's input includes the Score, Flags, Unflags, and the Current Board. The Score is 0.0909..., which is 1\/11, so they've flagged 1 mine correctly out of 11 flagged (since 1\/11 ≈ 0.0909). The Flags are 1\/11, meaning 11 flags placed, 1 correct. Unflags are 0.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ total mines (10), so 1\/10 would be 0.1, but here it's 1\/11, which suggests that 11 flags are placed, 1 of which is correct. So 10 of the flags are incorrect.\n\nNow, looking at the Current Board. Let's try to parse a few rows. Let's take row 3 (0-based), which is \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The F is at (3,1), which is a flagged cell. The question marks are unknown cells. We need to find safe cells to uncover or correct flags.\n\nMinesweeper logic: when a cell is uncovered and shows a number, that's the count of adjacent mines. So, for example, if a cell shows 1, and it has one adjacent unknown cell, that unknown cell is a mine. If a cell shows 0, all adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered automatically (but in the input, maybe the user is only inputting actions, so the 0s are already uncovered).\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is F (flagged). Let's check adjacent cells. The cell at (3,0) is 1, (3,2) is 1. The cell (2,0) is 1, (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1. (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 2, (4,2) is 2. So the F at (3,1) is adjacent to cells with numbers. Let's see: (2,1) is 1. The cell (2,1) has 8 neighbors: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (2,1) is 1, so exactly one mine in those 8. The current state of these cells: (2,0)=1, (2,2)=1, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1. The others (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are 0 (from row 2: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — row 2 is (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, then 0s). So (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are 0 (uncovered safe cells). So (2,1) has neighbors: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (2,0)=1 (uncovered), (2,2)=1 (uncovered), (3,0)=1 (uncovered), (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=1 (uncovered). So the only unknown in (2,1)'s neighbors is the F at (3,1). Since (2,1) is 1, that means there's 1 mine in its neighbors. The F is a flagged mine, so if that's correct, then (3,1) is a mine, which would satisfy the 1. But if (3,1) is not a mine, then there's a mine missing. But since the user has 11 flags and only 1 correct, maybe (3,1) is an incorrect flag. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLet's look for cells with known numbers and adjacent question marks. For example, in row 3, column 15 is \"?\", which is (3,15). The cell to the left is (3,14)=1, (3,16)=1. The cell above (2,14)=1, (2,15)=1, (2,16)=1. Below (4,14)=1, (4,15)=1, (4,16)=1. So (3,15) is surrounded by 1s. Let's check (2,15)=1. Its neighbors: (1,14), (1,15), (1,16), (2,14), (2,16), (3,14), (3,15), (3,16). (2,14)=1, (2,16)=1, (3,14)=1, (3,16)=1. The others (1,14), (1,15), (1,16) are 0 (row 2: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — (2,14)=1, (2,15)=1, (2,16)=1, then 0s, so row 1 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\", which are all 0s. So (1,14)=0, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=0. So (2,15)=1 has neighbors: (1,14)=0, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=0, (2,14)=1, (2,16)=1, (3,14)=1, (3,15)=?, (3,16)=1. So the only unknown neighbor is (3,15). Since (2,15) is 1, there must be 1 mine in its neighbors. The known neighbors (2,14), (2,16), (3,14), (3,16) are all uncovered and show 1, which means they are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So the only possible mine in (2,15)'s neighbors is (3,15). Therefore, (3,15) must be a mine. Wait, but (2,15) is 1, so exactly one mine in its 8 neighbors. All the other neighbors are 0 or 1 (uncovered, so safe). So (3,15) must be the mine. Therefore, (3,15) should be flagged. But the user's current flags are 11, which is more than the total mines (10), so some flags are wrong. But maybe (3,15) is a mine that's not flagged yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, in row 5, column 2 is \"?\" (row 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (5,2)=?). Let's check the cell to the left, (5,1)=1. (5,1) has neighbors: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1. (5,1) is 1, so there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. Let's list the known cells: (4,0)=1 (safe, since it's a number), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=1 (safe), (6,2)=1 (safe). So the only unknown is (5,2). Since (5,1) is 1, there must be 1 mine in its neighbors. All the known neighbors are safe, so (5,2) must be the mine. Therefore, (5,2) is a mine, so it should be flagged. But in the current board, (5,2) is \"?\", so maybe the user hasn't flagged it yet.\n\nAnother example: row 7, column 8 is \"?\" (row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" — (7,8)=?). The cell to the left is (7,7)=1, to the right (7,9)=1. The cell above (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=1. Below (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1, (8,9)=1. Let's check (6,8)=1. Its neighbors: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,7)=0 (row 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"), (5,8)=0, (5,9)=0. (6,7)=1, (6,9)=1. (7,7)=1, (7,9)=1. So (6,8)=1's neighbors are mostly 0s and 1s (safe). The only unknown is (7,8). Since (6,8) is 1, there's 1 mine in its neighbors. All others are safe, so (7,8) must be a mine. So (7,8) is a mine.\n\nSimilarly, row 8, column 17 is \"?\" (row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" — (8,17)=?). Let's check (8,16)=1, (8,18)=1. (7,16)=1, (7,17)=1, (7,18)=1. (9,16)=1, (9,17)=1, (9,18)=1. (8,17) is surrounded by 1s. Let's take (7,17)=1. Its neighbors: (6,16), (6,17), (6,18), (7,16), (7,18), (8,16), (8,17), (8,18). (6,16)=0 (row 6: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"), (6,17)=0, (6,18)=0. (7,16)=1, (7,18)=1. (8,16)=1, (8,18)=1. So (7,17)=1's neighbors are all safe except (8,17). Therefore, (8,17) must be a mine.\n\nBut wait, the total mines are 10. If we find multiple cells that must be mines, but the user has already flagged 11, some of those flags are incorrect. The user's score is 1\/11, so 1 correct flag, 10 incorrect. So they need to unflag the incorrect ones and flag the correct mines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a 0 cell with adjacent ?. For example, row 0 and row 1 are all 0s. So (0,0) to (1,8) are all 0s, which means all their adjacent cells are safe. So any ? adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered safely. Wait, row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — all 0s. So all cells in row 0 are uncovered and safe, showing 0. That means all their adjacent cells (row 0's neighbors are row 1 and row 0's columns ±1) are also safe. Since row 0 is all 0s, their adjacent cells (row 1, all columns) must also be safe, which matches row 1 being all 0s. Then row 2 has \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — so (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, then 0s. The 0s in row 2 (columns 3-13, 17-19) are uncovered and safe, meaning their adjacent cells are safe. So the ? in the board that are adjacent to 0s can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 10: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (10,0)=?, (10,1)=?, (10,2)=1. The 0s in row 10, columns 3-19 are uncovered. The 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. So (10,3) is 0, so (11,3), (9,3), (10,2), (10,4), etc., are safe. But maybe row 10 is beyond the 9x9 grid. Wait, the problem states it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. The user's Current Board might have been pasted incorrectly, with 20 rows and columns. That's a problem. Let's assume that the actual board is 9x9, and the numbers are misaligned.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting, and the board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's re-express the Current Board as 9 rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\nThat makes more sense. Let's assume that's the correct 9x9 board. Now, let's analyze this.\n\nRow 0 and 1 are all 0s, so all their adjacent cells are safe. Row 2 has (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=1, rest 0s. Row 3: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=1, rest 0s. Row 4: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=1, rest 0s. Row 5: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=1, rest 0s. Row 6: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, rest 0s. Row 7: (7,7)=1, (7,8)=?, rest 0s. Row 8: (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1, rest 0s.\n\nNow, let's check (5,2)=? (row 5, column 2). The cell (5,1)=1. (5,1) is at (5,1), so its adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). Let's list their values:\n\n(4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=1 (safe), (6,2)=1 (safe). The only unknown is (5,2). (5,1) shows 1, meaning exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. All the known adjacent cells are safe (they are numbers, not mines), so the only possible mine is (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) must be a mine. So we should flag (5,2).\n\nBut the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10 mines, so they have 1 correct and 10 incorrect. Maybe one of the existing flags is wrong. For example, the flag at (3,1) (row 3, column 1). Let's check (3,1)=F. Let's look at (2,1)=1 (row 2, column 1). (2,1)'s adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0 (row 1 is all 0s), (2,0)=1, (2,2)=1, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=1 (all safe, as they are numbers). The only unknown is (3,1)=F. (2,1) shows 1, so there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If (3,1) is a mine (flagged correctly), that's the 1 mine. But if (3,1) is not a mine, then there's a mine missing. However, the user's score is 1\/11, which suggests that (3,1) is an incorrect flag (since only 1 is correct). So maybe (3,1) is not a mine, and the correct mine is (5,2). Therefore, the user should unflag (3,1) and flag (5,2). But the user's action options are uncover, flag, unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a safe cell to uncover. For example, row 5, column 4 is 0 (assuming row 5: [0,1,?,1,0,0,0,0,0]). The 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe. So any ? adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered. Let's check row 5, column 4 (0) — its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=0 (safe), (5,3)=1 (safe), (5,5)=0 (safe), (6,3)=1 (safe), (6,4)=0 (safe), (6,5)=0 (safe). So all adjacent cells are safe, so (5,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. Maybe another cell.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 8=? (row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?]). The cell (7,7)=1. (7,7)'s adjacent cells are (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). (6,6)=0 (row 6: [0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1]), (6,7)=1 (safe), (6,8)=1 (safe), (7,6)=0 (safe), (8,6)=0 (safe), (8,7)=1 (safe), (8,8)=1 (safe). The only unknown is (7,8). (7,7)=1, so exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells. All known adjacent cells are safe, so (7,8) must be a mine. So (7,8) is a mine, should be flagged.\n\nThe user has 11 flags, 1 correct. So they need to unflag 10 incorrect flags and flag 9 correct mines. But the best action now might be to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's find a 0 cell with adjacent ?. For example, row 0 and 1 are all 0s, so their adjacent cells (row 2, columns 0-2) are 1s, which are safe. The 0s in row 2, columns 3-8 (assuming 9 columns) are uncovered, so their adjacent cells are safe. So any ? in those areas can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 2=? (which we think is a mine), but if we're not sure, maybe uncover a cell that's safe. For example, row 5, column 5 is 0 (assuming row 5: [0,1,?,1,0,0,0,0,0]). Column 5 in row 5 is 0, so its adjacent cells are safe. Maybe uncover row 5, column 5, but it's already 0. Maybe row 7, column 4 is 0 (row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?]), so (7,4)=0, adjacent cells are safe. But all 0s are already uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell with a number that has more adjacent ? than the number, meaning some are safe. For example, row 4, column 1=2 (row 4: [1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0]). (4,1)=2. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?. So (4,1)=2 has two mines in its adjacent cells. Currently, (3,1) is flagged (maybe a mine), and (5,2) is a possible mine. If (3,1) is a mine (1), and (5,2) is a mine (2), that satisfies the 2. So (4,1)=2 is okay.\n\nGiven that the user's score is low (1\/11), they have many incorrect flags. Maybe the flag at (3,1) is incorrect. Let's check (3,1)=F. If we uncover (3,1), if it's a mine, the game ends (bad), but if it's safe, we can see the number and know the flag was wrong. But since the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10 mines, (3,1) is likely an incorrect flag. So uncovering (3,1) would either end the game (if it's a mine) or show a number, proving the flag was wrong. But the user's current score is 1\/11, which is 1 correct flag out of 11, so (3,1) is probably not a mine. Let's assume (3,1) is safe. So uncovering (3,1) would show a number, and we can unflag it.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's take row 5, column 4=0 (assuming it's 0). Its adjacent cells are all safe, so any ? near it is safe. Maybe row 5, column 6=0, so (5,6) is safe. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the cell (3,4) in the original input. The user's example input was 'uncover (3,4)', and the current board shows row 3 as \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". So (3,4) is 0 (the 4th column, 0-based). Since it's 0, uncovering it would be safe, but maybe it's already uncovered. The 0s in the board are already uncovered. So the ? are the unknown cells. So we need to find a ? that is safe to uncover.\n\nLooking back, in the original Current Board, row 3 has a ? at (3,15) (assuming columns are 0-based). Let's say (3,15) is a ?. The cell to the left is 1, right is 1, above is 1, below is 1. If those 1s have all their other adjacent cells as safe, then (3,15) might be a mine. But if we can find a ? that is adjacent to a 0, then it's safe.\n\nFor example, in row 0, all cells are 0, so their adjacent cells (row 1, all columns) are 0, which are safe. Row 1 is all 0s, so their adjacent cells (row 2, all columns) are safe. Row 2 has 1s in columns 0-2 and 14-16, and 0s elsewhere. The 0s in row 2 (columns 3-13, 17-19) are safe, so their adjacent cells (row 3, columns 3-13, 17-19) are safe. In row 3, column 4 is 0 (already uncovered), column 15 is ?, column 17 is 0. So (3,15) is a ?. The cells around (3,15) are 1s, but if the 1s have other adjacent cells that are safe, then (3,15) might be a mine. But without knowing the exact grid, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, any adjacent ? can be uncovered safely. Let's assume row 0, column 0 is 0, so (0,0) is uncovered. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all 0s (already uncovered). So no ? there.\n\nAnother 0 cell: row 2, column 3 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=0, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. All are uncovered, so no ? there.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=1, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 6, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=0. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nSo the ? cells are in areas surrounded by numbers, not 0s. Therefore, the only way to proceed is to either flag a known mine or uncover a cell that's likely safe.\n\nGiven that (5,2) is likely a mine (from earlier analysis), and the user has 11 flags (1 correct), they need to flag the correct mines. But the action could be to flag (5,2). However, the user's current flags are 11, which is more than 10, so they need to unflag an incorrect one first.\n\nAlternatively, the user's current board has a ? at (3,4) in the example input. Wait, the user's example input was 'uncover (3,4)', but in the current board, row 3 is \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — so (3,4) is 0 (the 5th character, 0-based index 4). So (3,4) is already uncovered (0), so no need to uncover it.\n\nAnother ? is at (5,2) (row 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"), which we think is a mine. So the action could be to flag (5,2). But the user has 11 flags, so they need to unflag one first. For example, unflag (3,1) (which is likely incorrect) and then flag (5,2). But the user can only take one action per epoch.\n\nThe user's current flags are 11, which is 1 more than the total mines (10). So they have 1 correct flag and 10 incorrect. To improve the score, they should unflag an incorrect flag and flag a correct mine. Let's assume (3,1) is an incorrect flag. So the action could be 'unflag (3,1)'. Then, next action could be to flag a correct mine like (5,2).\n\nBut the problem asks for the next action. Given that, maybe the best move is to unflag an incorrect flag. The flag at (3,1) is a candidate. Let's check (3,1)=F. The cell (2,1)=1. (2,1) has 8 neighbors: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). All of these except (3,1) are uncovered and are 0 or 1 (safe). So (2,1)=1 means there's 1 mine in these 8. If (3,1) is a mine, that's correct. But the user's score is 1\/11, so (3,1) is probably not the correct one. Maybe the correct flag is elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct flag is a mine that's correctly flagged, and the other 10 are wrong. The user needs to unflag the wrong ones. But without knowing where the correct flag is, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, uncover a ? cell that is likely safe. For example, (3,15) in the original board. If the cells around it are 1s, and those 1s have other adjacent cells that are safe, then (3,15) might be safe. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell with a number that has exactly that number of flagged cells around it, meaning the remaining ? are safe. For example, if a cell shows 2 and has 2 flags around it, the other ? are safe. Let's say a cell with 2 has 2 Fs around it, then the adjacent ? are safe.\n\nBut in the current board, let's take row 4, column 1=2 (row 4: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"). (4,1)=2. Its adjacent cells: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?. So there's 1 flag (F) and 1 ?. Since the cell shows 2, there should be 2 mines. So if (3,1) is a mine (1) and (5,2) is a mine (2), that's correct. So the ? at (5,2) is a mine, and the F at (3,1) is a mine. But the user has 11 flags, so there must be another flag elsewhere.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll make a decision. The safest action is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe. Looking at the board, row 0 and 1 are all 0s, so their adjacent cells (row 2) are 1s, which are safe. The 0s in row 2, columns 3-13 are safe, so their adjacent cells (row 3, columns 3-13) are safe. For example, (3,4) is 0 (already uncovered), (3,5) is 0 (already uncovered). Maybe (3,14) is 1 (uncovered), (3,15) is ?, (3,16)=1 (uncovered). The cell (3,15) is a ?. Let's check (2,15)=1. (2,15) has neighbors: (1,14), (1,15), (1,16), (2,14), (2,16), (3,14), (3,15), (3,16). (1,14)=0, (1,15)=0, (1,16)=0 (row 1 is all 0s), (2,14)=1, (2,16)=1, (3,14)=1, (3,16)=1. So (2,15)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. All neighbors except (3,15) are safe, so (3,15) is a mine. Therefore, (3,15) should be flagged. But the user has 11 flags, so they need to unflag one first. Let's unflag (3,1) (which is likely incorrect) and flag (3,15). But the action should be one.\n\nAlternatively, the user's current board has a ? at (3,15), which we determined is a mine. So the action is to flag (3,15). But the user has 11 flags, which is over the mine count, so maybe they have a flag on a safe cell. But the correct action is to flag the mine. So 'flag (3,15)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (3,15)","flag (3,15)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user provided the current board, which is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the rows are listed from 0 to 19, which might be a formatting error. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board, but assuming it's a 9x9 grid, perhaps the rows are 0-8. Let me check the rows: the given board has 20 rows (0-19), which is incorrect. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll focus on the relevant parts.\n\nThe current score is 0.1818, which is 2\/11, meaning there are 11 flags placed, but only 2 are correct. The goal is to flag all 10 mines correctly. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The win condition is either correctly flagging all mines or uncovering all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the board, let's parse the visible cells. Let's list the rows properly (assuming rows 0-8, maybe the user pasted extra rows by mistake). Let's correct that. Let's take the first 9 rows as the 9x9 grid.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (assuming the first 9 numbers)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 (wait, maybe columns 0-8, so 9 columns)\nWait, the user's board shows each row with 20 numbers, which is probably a mistake. Let's focus on the cells that have meaningful data, like 'F' and '?'.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is flagged (F). The adjacent cells in row 3, column 0 is 1, column 2 is 1. So (3,1) is flagged. The cell (5,2) is '?', (7,8) is '?', (8,8) is '?', (13,6) is '?', (13,10) is '?', (14,19) is '?', (15,4) is '?', etc. But maybe the actual grid is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Let's assume that.\n\nIn a 9x9 grid, the mines are 10. The current flags are 11, which is more than 10, so some flags are incorrect. The score is 2\/11, so 2 correct flags, 9 incorrect. Need to unflag the wrong ones, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet.\n\nLooking for safe cells to uncover. Let's look at cells with numbers that have adjacent '?' which can be determined. For example, in row 5, column 2 is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells. Row 5, column 1 is 1. The 1 at (5,1) has adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1. The 1 at (5,1) means there's 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. The neighbors are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). We know (4,0)=1 (number, so safe), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=1 (safe), (6,2)=1 (safe). The only unknown is (5,2)=? So if (5,1) is 1, then (5,2) must be a mine? Wait no: the number indicates the count of mines in adjacent cells. So (5,1) is 1, meaning one of its 8 neighbors is a mine. The known neighbors are all safe (since they are numbers or 0), so the only unknown is (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) must be the mine. Wait, but (5,1) is 1, and all other adjacent cells are safe (since they are numbers, which are safe cells), so the only possible mine is (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) is a mine, so it should be flagged. But currently, (5,2) is '?', so maybe we can flag it. But wait, the user has 11 flags, which is over the 10 mines. So maybe some flags are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at a cell that is definitely safe. For example, in row 2, column 3 is 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's find 0 cells.\n\nRow 0, column 0-8 are all 0. So the entire first two rows (rows 0 and 1) are 0, meaning all their adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' in rows 0,1, or adjacent to them can be uncovered. Wait, row 0 is all 0s. The 0s in row 0 mean that their adjacent cells (row 1, columns 0-8) are also safe, because a 0 indicates no mines in adjacent cells. Since row 0 is 0, row 1 must also be 0, and row 2's first few columns are 1s. For example, row 2, column 0 is 1. The 1 at (2,0) has adjacent cells: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=1. The 1 at (2,0) means there's 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. The neighbors are (1,-1) invalid, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,-1) invalid, (2,1)=1, (3,-1) invalid, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1. So valid neighbors are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). Among these, (1,0) and (1,1) are 0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (safe), (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine is (3,1)=F. So that flag is correct because the 1 at (2,0) requires 1 mine, which is (3,1). So that's one correct flag (score 2, so another correct flag elsewhere).\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is F (from the user's board: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" – maybe columns 1 and 15 are F in row 3). If the grid is 9x9, maybe the user's board is misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps the board is displayed with each row having 20 characters, but it's actually 9x9, so columns 0-8. Let's ignore the extra numbers and focus on the cells with 'F' and '?'.\n\nThe user's current board has Flags: 2\/11, so 11 flags, 2 correct. So 9 incorrect flags. The goal is to flag the 10 mines correctly. To uncover safe cells, we need to find cells that are definitely safe.\n\nAnother approach: look for a '0' cell, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Uncovering those cells will reveal more numbers. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, any adjacent '?' can be safely uncovered. Let's find 0 cells. From the board, row 0, row 1, and parts of row 2 are 0. For example, row 2, column 3 is 0. The 0 at (2,3) means all adjacent cells (row 1, columns 2-4; row 2, columns 2-4; row 3, columns 2-4) are safe. So (3,3) is 0 (from row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"), so (3,3) is 0. A 0 cell means all adjacent cells are safe. So (3,3) is 0, so (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,2), (3,4), (3,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4) are all safe. Wait, (3,3) is 0, so its adjacent cells (row 2, columns 2-4; row 3, columns 2-4; row 4, columns 2-4) must be safe. Let's check (3,4): it's 0 (from row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0...\"), so (3,4) is 0. Then (3,4) being 0 means its adjacent cells are safe. So (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are all safe. Since (3,4) is 0, we can uncover (4,4) if it's '?', but looking at row 4: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0...\", so (4,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. \n\nLooking for '?' cells. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a number, which can be determined. For example, in row 5, column 2 is '?'. Let's check the adjacent numbers. Row 5, column 1 is 1. The 1 at (5,1) has neighbors: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1. The 1 at (5,1) indicates there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. The known cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2) are all numbers (safe, not mines), so the only possible mine is (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) is a mine, so it should be flagged. But the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10, so maybe (5,2) is not flagged yet. If we flag it, but we need to check if it's a mine. Alternatively, if (5,1) is 1, and all other adjacent cells are safe, then (5,2) must be a mine, so we should flag it. But the user's current flags are 11, so maybe some flags are incorrect. However, the user hasn't unflagged any, so perhaps unflagging an incorrect flag would help. But the problem is to choose an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. For example, if a number cell has all its adjacent mines already flagged, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's take a number cell with a count that matches the number of adjacent flags. For example, row 3, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=F, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2. The 1 at (3,0) has 1 mine in its neighbors. The only flag is (3,1), so that's the mine, so the count is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), (4,1) are safe, which they are (they are numbers). So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: row 4, column 1 is 2. Its adjacent cells are (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?. The 2 at (4,1) means there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. We have one flag at (3,1), so there should be one more mine. The other cells: (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1) are all numbers (safe), so the only unknown is (5,2). Therefore, (5,2) must be the second mine for (4,1)'s 2. So (5,2) is a mine, so we should flag it. Currently, (5,2) is '?', so flagging (5,2) would be a correct flag. Since the user has 11 flags, which is 1 over, but maybe (5,2) is not flagged yet. Let's check the current flags: Flags: 2\/11, so 11 flags, 2 correct. If (5,2) is a mine, flagging it would increase correct flags to 3, and total flags to 12, but that's not ideal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recalculate (4,1)=2. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,0) = 1 (safe)\n(3,1) = F (flagged, possibly a mine)\n(3,2) = 1 (safe)\n(4,0) = 1 (safe)\n(4,2) = 2 (safe)\n(5,0) = 0 (safe)\n(5,1) = 1 (safe)\n(5,2) = ? (unknown)\n\nSo the 2 at (4,1) needs 2 mines in these 8 cells. If (3,1) is a mine (correct flag), then there's 1 mine, so we need 1 more. The only unknown is (5,2), so (5,2) must be a mine. Therefore, (5,2) is a mine, so flagging it would be correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is safe to uncover. For example, if a number cell has all its adjacent mines flagged, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's take row 2, column 8 (assuming 9 columns) which is 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to 0 can be uncovered. Looking at the board, row 5, column 4 is 0, so adjacent cells are safe. But maybe there's a '?' in a safe area.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7, column 8 (from the user's board: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0...\"), so (7,8) is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells. (7,7)=1, (7,9)=1 (but 9 is beyond 8 in 9x9), (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (6,9)=0 (invalid), (8,7)=1, (8,8)=?, (8,9)=1. So in a 9x9 grid, (7,8) has adjacent cells: (6,7), (6,8), (7,7), (8,7), (8,8). The cell (7,7)=1, which means 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (7,7)'s adjacent cells: (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (7,6)=0, (7,8)=?, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=?. The 1 at (7,7) needs 1 mine in these 8. Known safe cells: (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=1. So unknowns are (6,8)=1, (7,8)=?, (8,8)=?. (6,8)=1 is a number, so safe. So the mine must be either (7,8) or (8,8). But (7,8) is '?', (8,8) is '?'. So we can't determine yet.\n\nAnother cell: row 5, column 2 is '?', which we think is a mine. So flagging (5,2) would be a good move. Alternatively, if we can find a safe cell to uncover, that would help reveal more information. Let's check row 3, column 4. From the user's board, row 3 is \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" – so (3,4) is 0 (since the 4th column is 0). A 0 cell means all adjacent cells are safe. So (3,4) is 0, so its adjacent cells are safe. Let's confirm: (3,4) is 0, so (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are all safe. If any of these are '?', we can uncover them safely. Looking at row 4: \"1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0...\", so (4,4) is 0, already uncovered. Row 2: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\", so (2,4) is 0, already uncovered. Row 3, column 5: from row 3, it's 0 (since after 0 0 0...), so (3,5) is 0, uncovered. So (3,4) is 0, and all adjacent cells are already uncovered. \n\nWhat about row 5, column 4? It's 0 (from row 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0...\"), so (5,4)=0. A 0 cell means adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells: (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All these are numbers or 0, so already uncovered.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, so all adjacent cells (row 0, column 1; row 1, column 0; row 1, column 1) are safe, but they are already 0, so uncovered.\n\nAnother '?' is in row 13, column 6 (from the user's board: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\"), but that's probably outside the 9x9 grid. Let's focus on the 9x9 grid. Assuming the correct rows are 0-8 and columns 0-8, the '?' cells are:\n\n- (5,2)\n- (7,8)\n- (8,8)\n- Maybe others, but let's check.\n\nRow 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\" → (5,2) is '?'\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1\" → (7,8) is '?' (assuming columns 0-8)\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" → maybe (8,8) is 1, but the user's board says \"1 ? 1 0\" → maybe (8,8) is '?'\n\nAssuming (5,2) is '?', and we determined it's a mine, so flagging it would be good. But the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10, so maybe some flags are incorrect. For example, in row 3, column 15 is F (from the user's board: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"), which is outside the 9x9 grid, so that's an incorrect flag. So unflagging that would reduce the total flags to 10. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet. However, the problem is to choose an action, and the user might need to uncover a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a cell that is safe to uncover. For example, (5,4) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered. (3,4) is 0, adjacent cells are safe. Maybe (5,5) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe. \n\nWait, let's think of the win condition: uncover all safe cells. The safe cells are all cells that are not mines. There are 9x9 - 10 = 71 safe cells. If we uncover all 71, we win. So any safe cell that is still '?' should be uncovered. \n\nLooking for a '?' that is a safe cell. Let's take (5,2): we thought it's a mine, but maybe not. Let's recheck. The cell (5,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=2, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=1, (6,2)=1. The 1 at (5,1) means 1 mine in these 8. The cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are numbers (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=1 (safe), (6,2)=1 (safe). So only (5,2) is unknown. If (5,2) is a mine, then (5,1)=1 is correct. If (5,2) is safe, then (5,1)=1 would have 0 mines, which is incorrect. Therefore, (5,2) must be a mine. So it's a mine, not a safe cell. So we shouldn't uncover it, but flag it.\n\nAnother '?' cell: (7,8). Let's check (7,7)=1. (7,7) has adjacent cells: (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (7,6)=0, (7,8)=?, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=?. The 1 at (7,7) needs 1 mine. The known safe cells: (6,6)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,6)=0. The cells (6,7)=1, (6,8)=1, (8,7)=1 are numbers (safe). So the mine must be either (7,8) or (8,8). So we can't be sure. \n\nWhat about (8,8)? (8,7)=1. (8,7) has adjacent cells: (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=?, (8,6)=0, (8,8)=?, (9,6)=0 (invalid), (9,7)=0 (invalid), (9,8)=0 (invalid). So (8,7)=1 has 1 mine in (7,7)=1 (safe), (7,8)=?, (8,6)=0 (safe), (8,8)=?. So again, either (7,8) or (8,8) is a mine.\n\nAnother '?' cell: (14,19) in the user's board, but that's outside 9x9. Let's ignore that.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's find a 0 cell's adjacent '?'. For example, row 2, column 3 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (1,4)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,4)=0, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0. All these are already uncovered. \n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,3)=0, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,3)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=0, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 cells' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Then, we need to look for cells with numbers that have adjacent '?' which can be determined as safe. For example, a number cell with count equal to the number of adjacent flags, so the remaining '?' are safe.\n\nLet's take row 4, column 2=2. Its adjacent cells: (3,1)=F, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=0, (4,1)=2, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=1. The 2 at (4,2) means 2 mines in these 8. We have 1 flag at (3,1). So there should be 1 more mine. The cells (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=0 (safe), (4,1)=2 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (5,1)=1 (safe), (5,3)=1 (safe). So the only unknown is (5,2)=?, which must be the mine. So (5,2) is a mine, so flag it.\n\nSince the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10, but (5,2) is a mine, flagging it would increase correct flags to 3 (since current is 2), and total flags to 12. But maybe some of the existing flags are incorrect. For example, the flag at (3,15) (from the user's board) is outside the grid, so it's an incorrect flag. Unflagging that would reduce total flags to 10, and then flagging (5,2) would make it 10 flags, 3 correct. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet. However, the problem requires to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's think of a cell that is not a mine. For example, (5,4)=0, which is already uncovered. (5,5)=0, uncovered. (6,5)=0, uncovered. (7,5)=0, uncovered. \n\nWait, let's look at row 5, column 5: it's 0 (from row 5: \"0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\"), so (5,5)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All are 0 or numbers, so safe. So any '?' adjacent to (5,5) would be safe, but (5,5) is 0 and adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: the user has a score of 2\/11, meaning 2 correct flags and 9 incorrect. To improve the score, we should unflag incorrect flags. Let's find an incorrect flag. For example, a flag that is in a cell adjacent to a 0. Since 0 cells have no adjacent mines, any flag adjacent to a 0 is incorrect. Let's check if any flags are adjacent to 0 cells.\n\nRow 0 and row 1 are all 0s. So any flag in row 0, row 1, or adjacent to them (row 2, columns 0-8) would be incorrect if they are flagged. Looking at the user's board, row 3 has a flag at (3,1) (column 1). Row 3, column 1 is adjacent to row 2, column 0-2 (which are 1s), so not adjacent to a 0. Another flag in row 3, column 15 (from the user's board), which is outside the 9x9 grid, so that's definitely incorrect. So unflagging (3,15) would be a good move. But the user's board is probably misformatted, so maybe the flags are within 9x9. Let's assume the flags are at (3,1) and another cell. Since the user has 11 flags, which is more than 10, one of them is definitely incorrect. For example, if a flag is placed on a cell that is adjacent to a 0, that's incorrect. Let's say there's a flag at (0,0), which is a 0 cell. Since 0 cells are safe, (0,0) can't be a mine, so the flag there is incorrect. Unflagging it would reduce the incorrect flags.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions of the flags, it's hard. Alternatively, let's choose to uncover a cell that is safe. Let's pick (5,2) – no, we think it's a mine. (7,8) – unknown. (8,8) – unknown. Maybe (5,2) is a mine, so flagging it. But the user's current flags are 11, so maybe (5,2) is not flagged yet. So the action would be 'flag (5,2)'.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the initial board again. The user's current board has rows with 20 columns, which is likely a mistake. Let's assume the correct 9x9 grid, and the '?' cells are (5,2), (7,8), (8,8). Let's pick (5,2) as a mine and flag it. So the action is 'flag (5,2)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (5,2)","flag (5,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user has some flags already, 3 correct out of 11 flagged (since the score is 0.2727, which is 3\/11). The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to parse the rows. Wait, the board is presented as 20 rows? That seems off. Oh, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the Minesweeper board should be 9x9, so perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check again. The user wrote \"Current Board:\" followed by 20 rows, each with 20 numbers\/letters. That's probably a mistake. Maybe it's a 9x9 grid but the way it's displayed is messed up. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and the rows are actually 9 rows. Let's assume that. Let's see, the original problem says 9x9 grid. So maybe the current board is presented with each row being 9 columns. Let's try to correct that.\n\nWait, the user's Current Board section has 20 lines, each starting with a row number (0 to 19) and then 20 entries. That's definitely a mistake. Maybe it's a copy-paste error. Since Minesweeper is 9x9, perhaps the actual current board is the first 9 rows, each with 9 entries. Let's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (assuming 9 columns)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\n\nBut that's a guess. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to show a 9x9 grid but the formatting is off. Let's focus on the cells that have '?', which are unknown. The '?' cells are the ones we can consider uncovering or flagging.\n\nLooking at the user's Current Board, let's find all the '?'s. Let's scan each row:\n\nRow 7: ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 ... → Assuming (7,8) is a '?' (row 7, column 8)\nRow 8: ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ... Wait, the user's row 8 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" → So (8,8) is '?'\nRow 14: \"1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\" → (14,19) is '?'\nRow 13: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\" → (13,0), (13,1), (13,6), (13,10)\nRow 12: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (12,0), (12,1)\nRow 11: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (11,0), (11,1)\nRow 10: \"? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,0), (10,1)\n\nBut again, the 9x9 grid is supposed to be 9 rows and 9 columns, so perhaps the user's board is misformatted, and the actual grid is 9x9. Let's assume that the rows are 0-8 (9 rows) and columns 0-8 (9 columns). Let's check the original problem statement again: \"the coordinate of the top-leftmost grid is (0, 0)\". So (row, col) starts at (0,0) top-left.\n\nLooking for '?' in a 9x9 grid. Let's suppose the user's Current Board has some '?' in the correct positions. For example, in row 7 (assuming 0-based), the user's row 7 is: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" → if we take columns 0-8, then (7,8) is '?'. Similarly, row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" → (8,17) would be '?', but that's beyond 8 columns. So maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Alternatively, perhaps the board is correct, and I need to work with it as given, even if it's 20x20. But that's unlikely. Probably a formatting error. Let's proceed with the 9x9 assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's Current Board is a 9x9 grid, but each row is written with extra spaces. Let's try to parse row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" → perhaps columns 0-8 are \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\", and columns 9-18 are another part, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to show a larger board, but according to the rules, it's 9x9. So perhaps the 'Current Board' is a mistake, but the user wants us to focus on the '?' cells. Let's look for the '?' in the given text.\n\nLooking at the user's Current Board:\n\nRow 7: ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 ... → (7,8) is '?'\nRow 8: ... 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 ... → (8,8) is '?'\nRow 13: ... 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 ... → (13,6) and (13,10) are '?'\nRow 14: ... 0 0 0 0 1 ? → (14,19) is '?'\n\nBut since the grid is 9x9, these row numbers (like 13,14) are invalid. So definitely a formatting error. Let's ignore the row numbers and just look for '?' in the text. The '?'s are in positions like (row, col) where the cell is '?'. Let's list all '?' positions from the Current Board text:\n\n- \"0 1 ? 1 0\" → (maybe row 7, col 8)\n- \"1 ? 1 0\" → (row 8, col 8)\n- \"? ? 1 0\" → rows 10,11,12,13 have \"? ? 1 0...\" so (10,0), (10,1), (11,0), (11,1), (12,0), (12,1), (13,0), (13,1)\n- \"1 ? 1 0\" → row 13 has \"1 ? 1 0\" → (13,6)\n- \"1 ? 1\" → row 13 has \"1 ? 1\" → (13,10)\n- \"1 ?\" → row 14 has \"1 ?\" → (14,19)\n\nBut again, these row numbers are beyond 8 for a 9x9 grid. So this must be a mistake. Let's assume that the user made a mistake in pasting the board, and perhaps the actual '?' cells are in the 9x9 grid. Let's think of a standard Minesweeper scenario.\n\nThe user's score is 3\/11, meaning 3 correct flags and 8 incorrect flags (since 11 total flags). The win condition is to flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or uncovering a mine.\n\nThe best strategy is to uncover cells that are definitely safe (i.e., cells that have adjacent numbers which indicate that the surrounding cells are safe) or flag cells that are definitely mines.\n\nAssuming the board has some numbered cells that can help. For example, if a cell shows '1' and has one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. Or if a cell shows '2' and has two adjacent 'F's, then the rest are safe.\n\nBut given the board is probably misformatted, perhaps the user intended to show a 9x9 grid with some '?'s. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a numbered cell which can be determined as safe.\n\nFor example, in a standard Minesweeper setup, if a cell with number '1' has only one unknown cell adjacent, that unknown is a mine. If a cell with number '0' (empty) is uncovered, all adjacent cells are safe and get uncovered automatically.\n\nSince the user's board has some '0's, those are safe cells that have been uncovered, meaning their adjacent cells have 0 mines. So any '?' adjacent to a '0' can be safely uncovered.\n\nLooking at the Current Board (assuming 9x9), let's say there's a '0' at (2,3). Then the adjacent cells (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are all safe. If any of those are '?', they can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a cell with '1' and has one 'F' adjacent, then the other '?'s are safe.\n\nBut without a clear board, it's hard. However, the user's action needs to be in the format 'uncover (row, col)', 'flag (row, col)', or 'unflag (row, col)'.\n\nGiven that the user has 11 flags, 3 correct, 8 incorrect. So some flags are wrong and need to be unflagged, but the user's Unflags: 0, so they haven't unflagged any. But the problem says to output an action. Since the score is 3\/10 (if total mines are 10), but the user has 3 correct out of 11 flags. So 8 flags are incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if any of those are '?', uncovering them is safe.\n\nAssuming in the Current Board, there's a row like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" (row 0), which are all 0s. So their adjacent cells (row 1, columns 0-8) are all safe. If row 1 has '0's, then row 2's adjacent cells are also safe.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 2: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → the '0's here (columns 3,4,5, etc.) indicate that those cells have 0 adjacent mines. So their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nSuppose (2,3) is 0. Then (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) are all safe. If (3,4) is a '?', then uncovering (3,4) is safe.\n\nLooking at the user's row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" → (3,3) is 0, (3,4) is 0, (3,5) is 0, etc. So (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. Wait, no, the 0s are already uncovered. So the '?' cells are the unknown ones.\n\nAnother approach: the user's current board has a '?' in row 7, column 8 (assuming 0-based). Let's say (7,8) is '?'. If the adjacent cells to (7,8) have numbers that can help. For example, if (7,7) is 1, (7,9) is 1 (but 9 is beyond 8), (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1, (6,9) is 1, (8,7) is 1, (8,8) is '?', (8,9) is 1. So if (7,7) is 1, which is adjacent to (7,8), then (7,8) might be a mine if the 1 has only one adjacent unknown. But without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has 11 flags but only 10 mines, 1 of the flags is definitely wrong. But unflagging would require knowing which one, which is hard without info.\n\nGiven that the user's score is 3\/10 (since 3 correct flags out of 10 mines), and they have 11 flags, they have 8 incorrect flags. But the problem says to output an action. The safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe.\n\nLooking back at the Current Board, row 0 and row 1 are all 0s. So any cell adjacent to row 0 or 1 is safe. For example, row 2, column 0 is 1, which is adjacent to row 1, column 0 (0), so it's safe. The 0s in row 0 and 1 mean that their adjacent cells (row 0 and 1's neighbors) are safe. So any '?' in row 2, columns 0-2 (since row 2 starts with 1 1 1) might be safe, but they are already uncovered (as 1s). The '0's in row 2, columns 3-5 are uncovered, so their adjacent cells (row 3, columns 3-5) are 0s, which are already uncovered. \n\nAnother area: row 6: \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (6,3) is 1, (6,4) is 0. The 0 at (6,4) means adjacent cells (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5) are safe. If any of these are '?', they can be uncovered.\n\nLooking for '?' in these areas. Suppose (7,8) is '?'. If (7,7) is 1, (8,7) is 1, (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1, (8,8) is '?', then maybe (7,8) is a mine. But without more info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, since the user's score is low (3\/10), maybe they have some incorrect flags that can be unflagged, but the problem requires an action, and uncovering is more likely to progress the game.\n\nGiven that the user's board has a '?' in row 7, column 8 (assuming 0-based), and if that's adjacent to a 1, maybe it's safe. Alternatively, let's pick a cell that's likely safe. For example, (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Looking at row 3: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" → (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. Wait, no, the 0s are already uncovered. So (3,4) is a 0, which is safe, but it's already uncovered. So maybe the user's board has a typo, and (3,4) is a '?'. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's row 3 is: \"1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\". So columns 0-8 are [1, F, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. So that's not a '?'.\n\nLooking for '?' in the board. The user's Current Board has \"0 1 ? 1 0\" in row 5? No, row 5 is \"0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (5,2) is F. \n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\" → (7,8) is '?'\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0\" → (8,17) is '?'\n\nRow 13: \"? ? 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1\" → (13,0), (13,1), (13,6), (13,10) are '?'\n\nRow 14: \"1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ?\" → (14,19) is '?'\n\nBut these are all outside 9x9. So perhaps the user made a mistake, and the actual '?' is in (7,8) of a 9x9 grid. Let's assume that (7,8) is a '?'. Let's check its neighbors. If (7,7) is 1, (7,9) is out of bounds, (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is 1, (6,9) is out, (8,7) is 1, (8,8) is 1, (8,9) is out. So (7,8) is surrounded by 1s. If those 1s each have only one mine adjacent, then (7,8) could be a mine. But if the 1s have other mines flagged, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (8,8) is a '?'. If (8,7) is 1, (8,9) is 1, (7,7) is 1, (7,8) is '?', (7,9) is 1, (9,7) is out, (9,8) is out, (9,9) is out. So (8,8) is adjacent to 1s. If those 1s have their mines already flagged, then (8,8) is safe.\n\nBut without knowing the exact positions of the mines, it's hard. The best guess is to uncover a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, which is safe. For example, if there's a 0 in (2,3), then (3,4) is adjacent to 0 and is safe. Let's assume (3,4) is a '?'. Then uncovering (3,4) is safe.\n\nWait, the user's row 3 has (3,3) as 0, (3,4) as 0, so those are already uncovered. So maybe another cell. Let's pick (7,8) as a '?'.

The board is 9x9, but wait, the current board shown has 19 rows? That must be a mistake. Oh, maybe it's a formatting error. The problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so the rows should be 0-8 and columns 0-8. The initial board is all '?', which means unknown. \n\nFirst, I need to start by uncovering a cell. The best strategy in Minesweeper is to start with a corner or edge to minimize risk, but since all cells are unknown, any first move is safe (except if it's a mine, but the first move in some versions doesn't hit a mine, but the problem doesn't specify that). So I'll pick a starting cell, maybe (0,0) or (4,4). Let's go with (0,0) as a common starting point.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (0,0). Let me check the input format. The correct format is 'uncover (row, col)', so 'Answer: uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, there are 18 rows listed. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Oh, no, the user probably pasted the board incorrectly. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the current board display is a mistake. But let's focus on the rules and the input.\n\nThe current board has cells marked with numbers, '?', and 'F' (but in the given board, I don't see any 'F's, so Flags are 0\/18 as per the score line). The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags divided by 10.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in Minesweeper, a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. '?' means the cell is unknown (not uncovered, not flagged). 'F' is a flagged mine.\n\nThe user's task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Since Flags are 0, there are no F's on the board yet. So maybe we need to look for cells that must be mines (to flag) or safe cells to uncover.\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers and adjacent '?'s. For example, let's take a row from the current board. Let's pick a row that's readable. Let's assume the rows are 0-8, but the input shows 18 rows, which is confusing. Maybe it's a formatting error. Let's try to parse the board correctly.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"Current Board:\" followed by 18 lines, each with 19 characters (since each line has 0 0 0 ... separated by spaces). That can't be 9x9. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different grid size, but according to rule 1, it's 9x9. Maybe the current board is misformatted, but perhaps the key is to look for obvious safe cells or mine cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is displayed with each row's cells separated by spaces, so each line is a row. Let's count the number of elements per row. For example, the first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" has 19 elements. That's 19 columns. But rule 1 says 9x9. So there's a mistake here. But maybe the actual grid is 18x19? That seems unlikely. Perhaps it's a copy-paste error, and the board is supposed to be 9x9 but got duplicated. Let's ignore that for a moment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display, but the key is to find a cell that is safe to uncover. Since the game ends if we uncover a mine, we need to find cells that are definitely safe.\n\nLet's look for a cell with a number that has adjacent '?'s where the number equals the number of adjacent flagged mines, meaning the remaining '?'s are safe. But since there are no flags (Flags: 0\/18), that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell has a number 0, all adjacent cells are safe. But in the given board, let's look for 0s. For example, the first row has several 0s. Let's take a 0 cell. Suppose a cell with 0 is uncovered, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. If any of those adjacent cells are '?', they can be safely uncovered.\n\nWait, but in Minesweeper, when you uncover a 0, it automatically uncovers all adjacent cells, which might also be 0s, and so on. So if there's a 0 in the board, and adjacent cells are '?', those '?' can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". Let's say row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells (row 0-1, column 0-1) would be (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). If those are 0s, then their adjacent cells are safe. But maybe the first row has a 0 at (0,0), and since it's 0, all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) have 0 mines. So any '?' adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered.\n\nWait, but the '0' in the board means that the cell itself is uncovered, and shows that there are 0 mines around it. So any adjacent '?' cells to a 0 are safe, because the 0 indicates that there are no mines in any of the 8 adjacent cells. Therefore, those '?' cells can be safely uncovered.\n\nLet's find a 0 cell with adjacent '?'s. Let's look at the first row: the 7th element is '?', which is (0,7) if columns are 0-indexed. The cell to the left of it is 1 (column 6), and to the right is 1 (column 8). The cell above and below? Let's check row 1, column 7: row 1 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\", so (1,7) is '?'. Row 2, column 7: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" has (2,7) as 1.\n\nWait, perhaps (3,0) is '?', as row 3 starts with \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So (3,0) is '?'. Let's see the adjacent cells to (3,0). The cell to the right is (3,1) which is 1. The cell below is (4,0) which is 1. The cell above is (2,0) which is 1. The diagonal up-right (2,1) is 1. So (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1. The 1 in (3,1) indicates that there is 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (3,1) is adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,1) is 1, so among these 8 cells, 1 is a mine. We know (3,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (4,2)=0. So the mine must be in (2,0), (2,1), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1). But (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1. Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. So all adjacent cells are 0, which means their adjacent cells are also safe. So any '?' in the vicinity of these 0s can be uncovered. Let's see row 0, column 5 is 0. The next cell is (0,6)=1. (0,6)=1 has adjacent cells. The cell (0,7) is '?'. (0,6) is 1, so there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (0,6) are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?. So (0,6) is 1, so among (0,7), (1,6), (1,7), there is 1 mine. (1,6) is 1, which is a number, so it's uncovered. So (1,6)=1 is a safe cell (since it's a number, not a mine). So the mine must be either (0,7) or (1,7). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is a number and all adjacent '?'s except one are already accounted for. For example, if a cell has a number 1 and there's only one '?' adjacent, then that '?' must be a mine. But since there are no flags, maybe we can flag it. But the score is 0.0, so we need to flag correctly.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that is a '?' and is adjacent to multiple numbers that indicate it's safe. For example, if two adjacent cells both have numbers that, when considering their other adjacent cells, the '?' must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, since the game ends at 100 epochs, maybe we can just uncover a cell that's likely safe. Let's pick a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 cell, and a '?' next to it, that '?' is safe. Let's find such a cell.\n\nLooking at row 0: columns 0-5 are all 0s. The cell (0,5) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=0, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. So (0,5) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. (0,6) is 1, which is a number, so it's safe. (1,5)=0, which is safe. So the cells around (0,5) are safe, but (0,6) is 1, which is safe. So maybe the '?'s further away.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4: \"1 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (4,4) is '?'. The cell to the left is (4,3)=1, right is (4,5)=1. The cell above is (3,4)=1 (row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" so (3,4)=1). The cell below is (5,4)=1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\" so (5,4)=1). So (4,4) is adjacent to (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1. All these are 1s. Each of these 1s indicates that there's 1 mine in their adjacent cells. For example, (3,4)=1: adjacent cells are (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=1. So (3,4)=1 has 8 adjacent cells, and 1 mine. The known cells here are 0s and 1s (which are safe), so the mine must be (4,4). Because all other adjacent cells are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So (4,4) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (4,4).\n\nWait, let's verify that. (3,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3): row 2 is \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" so (2,3)=0 (column 3). (2,4)=0 (column 4), (2,5)=0 (column 5). (3,3)=1 (row 3, column 3), (3,5)=1 (row 3, column 5). (4,3)=1 (row 4, column 3), (4,5)=1 (row 4, column 5). (4,4) is '?'. So (3,4)=1's adjacent cells are: 0,0,0,1,1,1,1,?. The 0s are safe (not mines), the 1s are safe (they are numbers, so they are uncovered and not mines). So the only possible mine in (3,4)'s adjacent cells is (4,4). Therefore, (4,4) must be a mine. So we should flag (4,4).\n\nAnother check: (4,3)=1. Its adjacent cells include (3,2)=0 (row 3, column 2 is 0), (3,3)=1, (3,4)=?, (4,2)=0 (row 4, column 2 is 0), (4,4)=?, (5,2)=0 (row 5, column 2 is 0), (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. So (4,3)=1's adjacent cells: 0,1,?,0,?,0,1,1. The 0s and 1s are safe, so the mine must be one of the '?'s: (3,4) or (4,4). But (3,4) is 1 (from row 3, column 4: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → column 4 is 1). Wait, row 3, column 4 is 1, which is a number, so it's uncovered and safe. So (3,4) is a safe cell (a number), so it can't be a mine. Therefore, the mine adjacent to (4,3)=1 must be (4,4). So yes, (4,4) is a mine. Therefore, flagging (4,4) is correct.\n\nAnswer: flag (4,4)","flag (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, there are 19 rows listed. Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake? Oh, no, maybe the user pasted it incorrectly. Wait, the original problem says it's a 9x9 grid, but the Current Board here has 19 rows. That might be a typo, but perhaps it's a 19x19 grid? Or maybe it's a mistake. But regardless, let's focus on the rules.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags divided by 10. Currently, Flags are 1\/18, which might mean 1 correct flag out of 18 flagged? Or maybe 1 flagged and 18 total mines? Wait, no, the problem states there are 10 hidden mines. So \"Flags: 1\/18\" probably means the user has flagged 18 cells, but only 1 is correct. That's bad. The score is 0.05555..., which is 1\/18, so that matches. So the user has 18 flags, 1 correct, 17 incorrect.\n\nThe game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. So we need to make moves that help us either uncover safe cells or correctly flag mines.\n\nLooking at the board, let's parse the current state. Each cell is either a number, '?', or 'F'. The numbers indicate adjacent mines. '?' are unknown, 'F' are flagged.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells that must be safe or must be mines. For example, if a numbered cell has all adjacent '?' cells equal to the number, those '?' must be mines. If a numbered cell has more '?' adjacent than the number, but some are flagged, then the remaining '?' could be safe.\n\nLet's take a row from the current board. Let's pick row 4 (since it's 0-indexed), which is: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So cell (4,4) is flagged (F). Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (4,4) is F, so maybe that's a mine. Let's see the surrounding numbers. For example, cell (3,4) is part of row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So (3,4) is 1. The cell (4,4) is adjacent to (3,4) (since row 3 is above row 4). The cell (3,4) has a value of 1, which means it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (3,4) would be (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check those:\n\n(2,3): row 2 is \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (2,3) is 0.\n\n(2,4): 0.\n\n(2,5): 0.\n\n(3,3): 1 (from row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → (3,3) is 1).\n\n(3,5): 1.\n\n(4,3): row 4 has \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (4,3) is 1.\n\n(4,4): F (flagged, so possibly a mine).\n\n(4,5): 1.\n\nSo the cell (3,4) has value 1. The adjacent cells include (4,4) which is F. If (4,4) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine for (3,4), so the other adjacent cells (which are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1) don't contribute. So that's possible.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number of adjacent '?' plus flagged cells equals the number. For example, if a cell has a number 2, and there are 2 '?' adjacent, and no flags, then those 2 '?' must be mines. Or if a cell has number 1, and there's 1 '?' adjacent, and the rest are safe, then that '?' is a mine.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". Let's take cell (0,6) which is 1. Its adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, (0,7) is '?', (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is '?'. So the 1 at (0,6) has two '?' adjacent (0,7 and 1,7). So the number of adjacent mines is 1, but there are two '?' here. So maybe one of them is a mine, but not sure yet.\n\nRow 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\". Cell (1,13) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,12), (0,13), (0,14), (1,12), (1,14), (2,12), (2,13), (2,14). (0,12) is 0, (0,13) is 1, (0,14) is '?', (1,12) is 0, (1,14) is '?', (2,12) is 0, (2,13) is '?', (2,14) is 1. So cell (1,13) is 2. The '?' cells here are (0,14), (1,14), (2,13). So three '?' cells. The number is 2, so two of them must be mines. Not sure which.\n\nRow 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". Cell (2,13) is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,12), (1,13), (1,14), (2,12), (2,14), (3,12), (3,13), (3,14). (1,12) is 0, (1,13) is 2, (1,14) is '?', (2,12) is 0, (2,14) is '?', (3,12) is 0, (3,13) is 1, (3,14) is 1. So (2,13) has two '?' (1,14 and 2,14). It's a 1, so one of them is a mine.\n\nRow 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". The first cell (3,0) is '?'. Let's see adjacent cells. Cell (3,0) is in row 3, column 0. Adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is 1 (row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\"), (2,1) is 1, (3,1) is 1, (4,0) is 1 (row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"), (4,1) is 1. So all adjacent cells are 1. The cell (3,0) is '?'. If (3,0) is a mine, then each adjacent cell (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) would have their mine count incremented by 1. But (2,0) is 1. Let's check (2,0): adjacent cells. (2,0) is in row 2, column 0. Adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0) is 0 (row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\"), (1,1) is 0, (2,1) is 1, (3,0) is '?', (3,1) is 1. So (2,0) has value 1. The adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=1. The count of mines here would be the number of mines in (3,0) plus any mines in (2,1) or (3,1). But (2,1) is 1, which is a number, so it's safe (since numbers are uncovered, not mines). (3,1) is 1, also uncovered, safe. So (2,0)'s 1 must come from (3,0) being a mine. Because the other adjacent cells (1,0, 1,1) are 0 (uncovered, safe). So (2,0) has 1 mine, which must be (3,0). Therefore, (3,0) is a mine. But wait, (3,0) is '?', so if that's a mine, maybe we should flag it. But the user has already flagged 18 cells, 1 correct. Maybe (3,0) is a mine. Let's confirm.\n\n(3,0) is adjacent to (4,0) which is 1 (row 4, column 0: 1). (4,0)'s adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0)=?, (3,1)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (5,0)=0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"), (5,1)=0. So (4,0) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only possible mine is (3,0). So yes, (3,0) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,0). But wait, the user's current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. The user has 18 flags, which is way more than 10 mines, so they have many incorrect flags. Maybe some of those can be unflagged. But the problem is to output the next action.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover. For example, if a cell has a number 0, all adjacent cells are safe. But looking at the board, there are 0s. For example, row 0 has several 0s. Let's take cell (0,0): 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are 0 in row 0 and row 1, so they are already uncovered and safe. So nothing new there.\n\nAnother example: cell (4,2) is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"). So (4,2) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Let's check those:\n\n(3,1): 1 (safe), (3,2): 0 (row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"), (3,3): 1 (safe), (4,1): 1 (safe), (4,3): 1 (safe), (5,1): 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"), (5,2): 0, (5,3): 1 (safe). All these are uncovered and safe, so (4,2) being 0 doesn't reveal new info.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number, and the number of adjacent flags plus '?' equals the number. For example, if a cell has value 2, and there are 2 '?' adjacent and 0 flags, then those '?' are mines. Or if a cell has value 1, and 1 '?' adjacent and 0 flags, then that '?' is a mine.\n\nLooking at row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". Cell (8,12) is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell (8,12) is in row 8, column 12. The cell (8,11) is 1 (row 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\"). So (8,11) is 1. Adjacent to (8,11) are (7,10), (7,11), (7,12), (8,10), (8,12), (9,10), (9,11), (9,12). Let's check row 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 2 1 0 0 0 0\". (7,10) is 0, (7,11) is 1, (7,12) is '?', (8,10) is 0, (8,12) is '?', (9,10) is 0 (row 9: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\"), (9,11) is 1, (9,12) is '?'. So (8,11) has value 1. The adjacent '?' cells are (7,12), (8,12), (9,12). That's three '?' cells. So the 1 in (8,11) means one of those three is a mine. Not sure which.\n\nLet's look at row 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Cell (17,11) is 2. Adjacent cells: (16,10), (16,11), (16,12), (17,10), (17,12), (18,10), (18,11), (18,12). Row 16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (16,10) is '?', (16,11) is '?', (16,12) is 1. Row 17: (17,10) is 1, (17,12) is 1. Row 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (18,10) is '?', (18,11) is '?', (18,12) is '?'. So (17,11) is 2. The adjacent '?' cells are (16,10), (16,11), (18,10), (18,11), (18,12). That's five '?' cells. The 2 here means two are mines. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe look for a cell that is a number, and the number of adjacent flags equals the number, meaning the remaining adjacent '?' are safe. For example, if a cell has value 2, and there are 2 flags adjacent, then the remaining '?' are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 4: (4,4) is F. Let's check cell (4,3) which is 1 (row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"). (4,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2) is 0 (row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"), (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (4,2) is 0, (4,4) is F (flagged), (5,2) is 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"), (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1. So (4,3) is 1, and has one adjacent flag (F at 4,4). So that flag is a mine, so the 1 is satisfied. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (which are all uncovered except maybe (3,4) which is 1) are safe. So (4,3) is 1, and since there's 1 flag (mine) adjacent, the rest are safe.\n\nAnother example: row 11: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". Cell (11,11) is 2. Adjacent cells: (10,10), (10,11), (10,12), (11,10), (11,12), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12). Row 10: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,10) is 0, (10,11) is 1, (10,12) is '?'. (11,10) is 1, (11,12) is '?'. Row 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\" → (12,10) is 1, (12,11) is '?', (12,12) is '?'. So (11,11) is 2. Adjacent '?' cells are (10,12), (11,12), (12,11), (12,12). That's four '?' cells. The 2 here means two are mines. Not sure.\n\nLet's go back to (3,0). Earlier analysis suggests (3,0) is a mine. Let's confirm again. Cell (2,0) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=1. Since (1,0) and (1,1) are 0 (uncovered, safe), (2,1) and (3,1) are 1 (uncovered, safe), the only possible mine adjacent to (2,0) is (3,0). Therefore, (3,0) must be a mine. So we should flag (3,0). But the user currently has 18 flags, which is more than 10, so they have 18 flags, 1 correct. Flagging (3,0) would make it 19 flags, but if (3,0) is a mine, then correct flags become 2, score 2\/10=0.2, which is better. But maybe there's a safer move.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell has a number N, and there are K flags adjacent (which are correct mines), then the remaining (N-K) mines are in the adjacent '?'. If the number of adjacent '?' is (N-K), then those are mines. If the number of adjacent '?' is more than (N-K), then the extra '?' are safe.\n\nFor example, cell (5,12) is 2 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"). Let's check (5,12)=2. Adjacent cells: (4,11), (4,12), (4,13), (5,11), (5,13), (6,11), (6,12), (6,13). Row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0. (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2. Row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" → (6,11)=1, (6,12)='?', (6,13)='?'. So (5,12)=2. Adjacent '?' cells are (6,12), (6,13). The number of adjacent flags is 0 (since (4,11-13) are 0, (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2, (6,11)=1). So N=2, K=0, so 2 mines in adjacent '?'. There are 2 '?' cells, so both (6,12) and (6,13) must be mines. Therefore, we should flag (6,12) and (6,13). That's a solid deduction.\n\nLet's verify: (5,12)=2. Adjacent cells: (4,11)=0 (safe), (4,12)=0 (safe), (4,13)=0 (safe), (5,11)=1 (safe), (5,13)=2 (safe), (6,11)=1 (safe), (6,12)='?', (6,13)='?'. So the only possible mines are (6,12) and (6,13). Since the count is 2, both must be mines. Therefore, flagging (6,12) and (6,13) would be correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's check (5,13)=2 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"). (5,13)=2. Adjacent cells: (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (4,14)=0, (5,12)=2, (5,14)=1, (6,12)='?', (6,13)='?', (6,14)=1. So adjacent '?' cells are (6,12), (6,13). The count is 2, so same as above, those two must be mines. That confirms it. So (6,12) and (6,13) are mines.\n\nTherefore, the next action should be to flag (6,12) or (6,13). Let's pick one, say (6,12). So the action is 'flag (6,12)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (6,12)","flag (6,12)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, there are 19 rows listed, which might be a formatting error. Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board. Let me check again. Oh, the user probably pasted the board with each row separated by a line, but 9x9 should have 9 rows. Let me count the lines: the Current Board section has 19 lines, which is way more than 9. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and each line is a row, but perhaps they meant 9 rows. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are separated by spaces, and each row is a line of 9 numbers. Let me check the first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – that's 19 elements, which is way more than 9. So there's definitely a formatting issue here. But maybe the user intended each row to be a line with 9 elements, and the numbers are separated by spaces. Let's assume that's a mistake, but perhaps the key is to focus on the flags and the known cells.\n\nThe score is 0.1111, which is 1\/9, but the Flags are 2\/18. Wait, the problem says total mines are 10, so \"Flags: 2\/18\" might mean 2 flags placed, 18 total possible? No, maybe the score is correct mines flagged divided by total mines (10). The current score is 0.111..., which is 1\/9, but 1\/9 is approximately 0.111, but 10 mines would make 1\/10=0.1. Maybe the user's note has a typo. Anyway, the important part is the current board.\n\nLooking at the board, there are cells marked with '?', 'F', and numbers. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Let's look for cells that must be safe or must be mines.\n\nFirst, check the flagged cells (F). The user has flagged 2 cells. Let's see where they are. For example, in row 4 (assuming rows are 0-indexed), there's \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – so (4,4) is flagged. Then in row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – (6,12) is flagged? Wait, the columns are probably 0-indexed, so if each row is a line, but the line has many elements, maybe the columns are 0 to 8. So perhaps the board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, and each row has 9 cells. Let's correct that. Let's take the first row as row 0, columns 0-8:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 \nRow 2: 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 \nRow 3: ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \nRow 4: 1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 \nRow 5: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 \nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\nWait, that makes more sense. The original input probably had each row's 9 cells listed, but the user pasted them with extra spaces or lines. Let's assume that. So row 0 has columns 0-8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1]. Row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1], etc.\n\nNow, let's look at the flagged cells. In row 4, column 4 is F (since row 4 is \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"). So (4,4) is flagged. Then in row 6, the line is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – maybe that's a mistake, perhaps row 6 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F\" (columns 0-8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,F]). So (6,8) is flagged. So two flags: (4,4) and (6,8).\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells. For example, in row 0, column 6 is 1. The adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). The cell (0,7) is '?', and (1,7) is '?'. The 1 in (0,6) means there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells.\n\nIn row 0, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) and (1,7) are '?', (1,8) is 1 (from row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1\" so (1,8) is 1). So (0,8) has 1 mine in (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). But (1,8) is a number, so it's uncovered and safe, so the mine must be in (0,7) or (1,7).\n\nRow 1, column 6 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,6) is 1 (safe), (0,5) is 0 (safe), (1,5) is 0 (safe), (2,5) is 0 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (2,7) is 1 (safe). So the 1 in (1,6) must have 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). Which matches the earlier analysis. So (0,7) and (1,7) are the only possible mines here, and exactly one of them is a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,7), (0,8), (1,7), (2,7), (2,8). (0,8) is 1 (safe), (2,7) is 1 (safe), (2,8) is 1 (safe). So the 1 in (1,8) must have 1 mine in (0,7) or (1,7). Again, same as before. So all three 1s (row 0 col6, row 1 col6, row 1 col8) point to (0,7) and (1,7) having exactly one mine.\n\nNow, let's look at row 3, column 0 is '?'. The cell (3,1) is 1. (3,1) is adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0) is 1 (row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\"), (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 0, (3,2) is 0, (4,0) is 1 (row4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"), (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 0. So (3,1)=1 has adjacent cells: (2,0)=1 (safe), (2,1)=1 (safe), (2,2)=0 (safe), (3,0)=?, (3,2)=0 (safe), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=0 (safe). So the 1 in (3,1) means there's 1 mine in (3,0). Because all other adjacent cells are uncovered and safe. Therefore, (3,0) must be a mine? Wait, no. Wait, the number in a cell is the count of mines in adjacent cells. So if (3,1) is 1, then exactly one of its 8 neighbors is a mine. Let's list the neighbors:\n\n(2,0): row 2, column 0 is 1 (uncovered, so safe, not a mine)\n(2,1): row 2, column 1 is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(2,2): row 2, column 2 is 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(3,0): ? (unknown)\n(3,2): row 3, column 2 is 0 (uncovered, safe)\n(4,0): row 4, column 0 is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(4,1): row 4, column 1 is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(4,2): row 4, column 2 is 0 (uncovered, safe)\n\nSo all neighbors except (3,0) are uncovered and safe (since they are numbers, not '?' or 'F'). Therefore, the mine must be in (3,0). So (3,0) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,0).\n\nWait, but let's confirm. If (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1)=1 is correct. Are there other possibilities? No, because all other neighbors are uncovered and not mines (since they are numbers, which are safe cells). So (3,0) must be a mine. So the action should be to flag (3,0).\n\nBut wait, the current flags are 2, and the total mines are 10. The user's score is 0.111..., which is 1\/9, but maybe they have 1 correct flag. If (4,4) is a mine, that's correct, and (6,8) is not, then the score is 1\/10=0.1. But maybe (4,4) is not a mine. Let's check (4,4). The cell (4,4) is flagged (F). Let's look at adjacent cells. (4,3) is 1 (row4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"), (4,5) is 1. (3,3)=1 (row3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"), (3,4)=1, (3,5)=1. (5,3)=1 (row5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"), (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1. So (4,4) is surrounded by 1s. The cell (4,3)=1: adjacent to (4,4). So (4,3)=1 means there's 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. Let's check (4,3)'s neighbors: (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=F, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. So (4,3)=1's neighbors: (3,2)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (4,2)=0 (safe), (4,4)=F (flagged, possibly mine), (5,2)=0 (safe), (5,3)=1 (safe), (5,4)=1 (safe). So the 1 in (4,3) could be accounted for by (4,4) being a mine. That's possible. Similarly, (4,5)=1's neighbors include (4,4)=F. So (4,5)=1's neighbors: (3,4)=1, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=F, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=0. So if (4,4) is a mine, then (4,5)=1 is correct (1 mine in neighbors). So (4,4) is likely a correct flag.\n\nThe other flag is (6,8). Let's check row 6, column 8 is F. Let's look at adjacent cells. Row 6: let's assume row 6 is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F\" (columns 0-8). So (6,7)=1. (6,7)=1's neighbors: (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0. So (6,7)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors. The only possible mine is (6,8), so if (6,8) is a mine, then (6,7)=1 is correct. So that's a possible correct flag. So maybe both flags are correct, but the score is 2\/10=0.2, but the user's score is 0.111, which is 1\/9. Maybe the board is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is not 9x9 but 19x19, which is possible. The initial problem says 9x9, but the current board has 19 rows. That's a contradiction. Maybe it's a mistake in the problem statement. Let's proceed with the given board as is, even if it's 19x19.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's find a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. For example, cells marked with '?' that are adjacent to numbers which have all their mine counts satisfied.\n\nTake row 0, column 7 is '?'. The cell (0,6)=1. The adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?, (0,5) is 0, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1 (safe). So (0,6)=1 has two '?' cells: (0,7) and (1,7). So 1 mine in those two.\n\nRow 0, column 8=1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=?, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=0. So (0,8)=1 has two '?' cells: (0,7) and (1,7). So 1 mine in those two.\n\nRow 1, column 6=1. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6)=1 has two '?' cells: (0,7) and (1,7). So 1 mine in those two.\n\nRow 1, column 8=1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=?, (0,8)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=0. So (1,8)=1 has two '?' cells: (0,7) and (1,7). So 1 mine in those two.\n\nSo all these 1s around (0,7) and (1,7) indicate that exactly one of them is a mine. So we can't be sure which one, but maybe there's another cell.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 is '?'. The cell (3,1)=1. Let's list (3,1)'s adjacent cells. Assuming the board is 19x19 (since there are 19 rows), row 3, column 1 is 1. Adjacent cells would be (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Let's check the values:\n\nRow 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0.\n\nRow 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → (3,0)=?, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0.\n\nSo (3,1)'s adjacent cells: (2,0)=1 (uncovered, safe), (2,1)=1 (uncovered, safe), (2,2)=0 (uncovered, safe), (3,0)=? (unknown), (3,2)=0 (uncovered, safe), (4,0)=1 (uncovered, safe), (4,1)=1 (uncovered, safe), (4,2)=0 (uncovered, safe). \n\nAll these adjacent cells except (3,0) are uncovered and safe (since they are numbers, not '?' or 'F'). Therefore, the mine count for (3,1) is 1, which must come from (3,0). Therefore, (3,0) is a mine. So we should flag (3,0).\n\nBut wait, the user's current flags are 2. If we flag (3,0), that's a third flag. But maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a cell that is '?' and has adjacent numbers that have their mine counts already satisfied, meaning the '?' is safe.\n\nFor example, take row 3, column 13: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" (row 3) has (3,13)=1. Let's check (3,13)=1's adjacent cells. Suppose (3,13)=1, and adjacent cells include (3,12)=0, (3,14)=1, (2,12)=0, (2,13)=1, (2,14)=?, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (4,14)=0. If (3,13)=1, and all adjacent cells except (2,14)=? are safe, then (2,14) might be a mine. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 6, column 12 is F. The row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\". So (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?, (6,14)=1. (6,11)=1. (6,11)=1's adjacent cells: (5,10)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,12)=2, (6,10)=0, (6,12)=F, (7,10)=0, (7,11)=1, (7,12)=?. So (6,11)=1 has (6,12)=F (possible mine) and (7,12)=? (unknown). If (6,12) is a mine, then (6,11)=1 is satisfied, so (7,12) is safe. So (7,12) could be uncovered.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 0, then all its adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover it. Let's look for 0s.\n\nRow 0 has several 0s. For example, (0,0)=0. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). If (0,0)=0, then those adjacent cells are safe. But (0,1) is 0 (row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (0,1)=0). So (0,1) is already uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 2=0 (row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (2,2)=0). Adjacent cells to (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0 (row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\" → (1,1)=0), (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1. All these are uncovered (numbers), so no '?' adjacent to (2,2)=0.\n\nRow 4, column 2=0 (row4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (4,2)=0). Adjacent cells: (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 0=0 (row5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\" → (5,0)=0). Adjacent cells: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo maybe there's no 0 adjacent to '?'. Let's look for a number that has more known mines than its count, meaning the remaining '?' are safe.\n\nFor example, row 1, column 13=2 (row1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\" → (1,13)=2). Adjacent cells to (1,13)=2: let's list them. (0,12)=0, (0,13)=1, (0,14)=?, (1,12)=0, (1,14)=?, (2,12)=0, (2,13)=1, (2,14)=?.\n\nSo (1,13)=2 has three '?' cells: (0,14), (1,14), (2,14). The count is 2, so two of these are mines. Not sure.\n\nRow 5, column 12=2 (row5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\" → (5,12)=2). Adjacent cells: (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?.\n\n(5,12)=2's adjacent cells: (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0 (all safe), (5,11)=1 (safe), (5,13)=2 (safe), (6,11)=1 (safe), (6,12)=F (flagged, possible mine), (6,13)=? (unknown). So if (6,12) is a mine, that's 1, so the 2 needs one more mine. So (6,13) could be a mine. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and all adjacent numbers have their mine counts already met, meaning the cell is safe. For example, if a '?' is adjacent to a 1 that already has a known mine in its neighbors, then the '?' is safe.\n\nTake row 3, column 0=?. We earlier determined it's a mine, so we should flag it. But maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's check row 7, column 12=? (row7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 2 1 0 0 0 0\" → (7,12)=?). The cell (7,11)=1. Adjacent cells to (7,11)=1: (6,10)=0, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=F, (7,10)=0, (7,12)=?, (8,10)=0, (8,11)=1, (8,12)=?.\n\nIf (6,12)=F is a mine, then (7,11)=1's mine count is 1 (from (6,12)), so (7,12) and (8,12) are safe. Therefore, (7,12) can be uncovered safely.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's verify:\n\n(7,11)=1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(6,10)=0 (safe)\n(6,11)=1 (safe)\n(6,12)=F (flagged, possibly mine)\n(7,10)=0 (safe)\n(7,12)=? (unknown)\n(8,10)=0 (safe)\n(8,11)=1 (safe)\n(8,12)=? (unknown)\n\nIf (6,12) is a mine (flagged correctly), then the mine count for (7,11)=1 is satisfied (1 mine). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells (7,12) and (8,12) must be safe. So uncovering (7,12) is safe.\n\nTherefore, the action should be to uncover (7,12).\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,12)","uncover (7,12)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the game rules. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the current board has 19 rows? Wait, no, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Wait, the user probably pasted the board with each row separated, but maybe it's a 19x19 grid? Wait, the Minesweeper Game Rules say it's a 9x9 grid. Hmm, maybe the current board is presented with each row as a line, and each line has 19 characters? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the current board. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided the Current Board as 19 lines, each with 19 characters (since each line is like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" which is 19 elements separated by spaces). But the game is supposed to be 9x9. That's confusing. Maybe it's a typo, and it's actually a 19x19 grid? Or maybe the user intended 9 rows but pasted 19. Alternatively, perhaps each row is written with spaces, and the actual grid is 9x9, but the way it's displayed here is with each cell separated by a space, so each row has 9 elements. Let's count: the first line is \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — that's 19 elements. So 19 columns. So 19x19 grid. Maybe the initial rule was a mistake, or maybe it's a larger board. Let's proceed with the given data.\n\nThe goal is to decide the next action: uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The current score is 0.111, which is 1\/9, since 10 mines total, so 1 correct flag. The flags are 2\/18, meaning 2 flags placed, 18 total possible? Not sure. The unflags are 0, so no flags have been removed.\n\nLooking at the board, we need to find cells that are safe to uncover or must be mines. Let's look for cells with numbers that can help us deduce mine positions.\n\nFor example, let's take a row. Let's look at row 4 (index 4, since rows start at 0). The row is: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". The F is at (4,4). So that's a flagged cell. Is that a correct mine? Maybe, but we don't know yet.\n\nLooking at row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\". There's an F at (6,12). The cell to the right of F is (6,13) which is \"?\". The number at (6,11) is 1. So (6,11) is a 1, which has adjacent cells. Let's see, (6,11) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (5,10), (5,11), (5,12), (6,10), (6,12), (7,10), (7,11), (7,12). The cell (6,12) is F (flagged), so if that's a mine, then (6,11)'s 1 is satisfied. So the 1 at (6,11) has one adjacent mine, which is the F at (6,12). So that might be correct. Then the cell (6,13) is \"?\", adjacent to (6,12) (F) and (6,14) which is 1. Let's check (6,14) which is 1. Its adjacent cells include (5,13), (5,14), (5,15), (6,13), (6,15), (7,13), (7,14), (7,15). (6,14) is 1, so one mine in those. (6,13) is \"?\", (6,15) is 0. So if (6,13) is a mine, then (6,14)'s 1 would be satisfied. But maybe not yet.\n\nAnother area: row 3 is \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". The first cell (3,0) is \"?\". The cell (3,1) is 1. Let's see (3,1) is 1, so adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,1) is 1, so one mine in those. (3,0) is \"?\", (3,2) is 0, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 0. (2,0) is 1, (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 0. So the possible mine could be (3,0) or (2,0) or (2,1) or (4,0) or (4,1). But (3,1) is 1, so only one of those is a mine. If (3,0) is uncovered, maybe it's a number or a mine. But maybe not the best move.\n\nLooking for cells that are \"?\" and have adjacent numbers that can be solved. For example, row 18 (last row): \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". The cell (18,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (17,7), (17,8), (17,9), (18,7), (18,9), (19,7), (19,8), (19,9) — but assuming rows are 0-18, so 19 rows. (18,8) is 1. The adjacent cells: (17,8) is 1, (17,9) is \"?\", (18,7) is 0, (18,9) is \"?\", (17,7) is 0. So (18,8) has 1 mine in (17,9) or (18,9). Then (18,12) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (17,11), (17,12), (17,13), (18,11), (18,13), (19,11), (19,12), (19,13). (18,12) is 1, and (18,11) is \"?\", (18,13) is 0. (17,12) is \"?\", (17,13) is 1. So maybe (18,11) is a mine? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is \"?\" and has all adjacent numbers that indicate it's safe. For example, if a \"?\" is adjacent to a 0, then uncovering it would show 0. Wait, 0 means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe. But 0 cells are already uncovered. Let's check where there are 0s. For example, row 0 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The 0s in row 0, columns 0-5: (0,0)-(0,5) are 0. So their adjacent cells are all safe. The cell (0,6) is 1, (0,7) is \"?\", (0,8) is 1. The 0s at (0,0)-(0,5) mean that all their adjacent cells (rows -1 is invalid, so row 0 and 1) in columns around them have no mines. So (0,0) is 0, so (1,0), (1,1), (0,1) are safe (already 0). So that area is safe.\n\nLooking at row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The cell (2,14) is \"?\", (2,13) is 1, (2,15) is 1. Let's check (2,13) which is 1. Its adjacent cells: (1,12), (1,13), (1,14), (2,12), (2,14), (3,12), (3,13), (3,14). (2,13) is 1. (1,13) is 2, (1,14) is \"?\", (2,12) is 0, (2,14) is \"?\", (3,12) is 0, (3,13) is 1, (3,14) is 1. So (2,13) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Maybe (2,14) is a mine? Or (1,14). But (2,15) is 1, which has adjacent cells (1,14), (1,15), (1,16), (2,14), (2,16), (3,14), (3,15), (3,16). (2,15) is 1. (1,15) is 2, (1,16) is 0, (2,14) is \"?\", (2,16) is 0, (3,14) is 1, (3,15) is 1, (3,16) is 0. So (2,15) has 1 mine, possibly (2,14) or (1,14). If (2,14) is a mine, then both (2,13) and (2,15) would have 1 mine each, which could work. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a \"?\" that is adjacent to a number that has all other adjacent cells accounted for. For example, row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\". The cell (5,12) is 2, (5,13) is 2. Let's take (5,12)=2. Its adjacent cells: (4,11), (4,12), (4,13), (5,11), (5,13), (6,11), (6,12), (6,13). (5,12)=2. (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=F (flagged), (6,13)=? (unknown). So (6,12) is flagged, so if that's a mine, then (5,12) has one mine already. So it needs one more. The remaining adjacent cells are (5,13) (which is 2), (6,13) (unknown). So (5,12) needs one more mine. (5,13)=2: adjacent cells would include (4,12), (4,13), (4,14), (5,12), (5,14), (6,12), (6,13), (6,14). (5,13)=2. (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (4,14)=0, (5,12)=2, (5,14)=1, (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?, (6,14)=1. So (5,13) has two mines. (6,12) is flagged (1 mine), so needs one more. That could be (6,13). So (6,13) is a mine. If that's the case, then (5,12) would have (6,12) and (6,13) as mines, which would make (5,12)=2. That fits. So (6,13) is likely a mine. But we can't flag it yet unless we're sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is \"?\" and when uncovered, it's definitely safe. For example, if a number cell has a count that equals the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining \"?\" cells around it are safe. Let's check row 4: (4,4) is F. The cell (4,3) is 1. (4,3)=1: adjacent cells are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (4,3)=1. (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=F (flagged), (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. So (4,3) has 1 mine, which is (4,4) (flagged). So all other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, any \"?\" adjacent to (4,3) that's not (4,4) is safe. But (4,3) is 1, and the adjacent cells are already uncovered except (4,4). So no help there.\n\nAnother example: row 6, (6,11)=1. Adjacent cells: (5,10), (5,11), (5,12), (6,10), (6,12), (7,10), (7,11), (7,12). (6,11)=1. (5,10)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,12)=0, (6,10)=0, (6,12)=F (flagged), (7,10)=0, (7,11)=1, (7,12)=0. So the only possible mine is (6,12)=F. So that 1 is satisfied. So the adjacent cells to (6,11) are safe except (6,12). So no new info.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\". The cell (1,7) is \"?\", (1,14) is \"?\". Let's check (1,6)=1. (1,6)=1: adjacent cells (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Possible mines could be (0,7) or (1,7). If (1,7) is uncovered and it's a number, that might help. Let's say we uncover (1,7). If it's a number, we can get more info. Alternatively, if it's a mine, the game ends, but we need to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a \"?\" that's surrounded by 0s. For example, in row 0, columns 0-5 are 0s, so their adjacent cells are all safe. The cell (0,7) is \"?\", but (0,6)=1, which is adjacent to (0,7). So (0,7) can't be a 0, because (0,6)=1 means there's 1 mine around it, which could be (0,7).\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (17,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (16,7), (16,8), (16,9), (17,7), (17,9), (18,7), (18,8), (18,9). (17,8)=1. (16,7)=1, (16,8)=2, (16,9)=?, (17,7)=0, (17,9)=?, (18,7)=0, (18,8)=1, (18,9)=?. So (17,8) has 1 mine in those. Maybe (17,9) is safe? Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the score is 0.111, which is 1\/9, so 1 correct flag out of 10 mines. The user has 2 flags placed (Flags: 2\/18). So two flags, one correct, one incorrect. So need to find more mines to flag. But to flag, we need to be sure. Alternatively, uncover safe cells to win by uncovering all safe cells.\n\nThe win condition is either correctly flag all mines or uncover all safe cells. So if we can uncover all non-mine cells, we win. So we need to find cells that are safe (not mines) and uncover them.\n\nLet's look for a \"?\" that is definitely safe. For example, if a number cell has a count equal to the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining \"?\" around it are safe. Let's take row 11: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (11,12) is \"?\", (11,11)=2. (11,11)=2: adjacent cells (10,10), (10,11), (10,12), (11,10), (11,12), (12,10), (12,11), (12,12). (11,11)=2. (10,10)=1, (10,11)=1, (10,12)=?, (11,10)=1, (11,12)=?, (12,10)=0, (12,11)=?, (12,12)=?. So (11,11) needs two mines in those cells. Not helpful.\n\nRow 10: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (10,0) is \"?\", (10,4) is \"?\", (10,12) is \"?\". (10,1)=1: adjacent cells (9,0), (9,1), (9,2), (10,0), (10,2), (11,0), (11,1), (11,2). (10,1)=1. (9,0)=1, (9,1)=1, (9,2)=0, (10,0)=?, (10,2)=0, (11,0)=1, (11,1)=1, (11,2)=0. So (10,1) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Possible mine is (10,0) or (9,0) or (9,1) or (11,0) or (11,1). But (10,0) is \"?\", so maybe uncovering (10,0) would be risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's \"?\" and is adjacent to a 0. 0 cells have no adjacent mines, so all their adjacent cells are safe. Let's find 0 cells and see their adjacent \"?\". For example, row 2 has \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The cell (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. So their adjacent cells are all safe. Let's check (2,2)=0: adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1. All these are uncovered, so no \"?\" here.\n\nRow 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". (3,2)=0. Adjacent cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (4,2)=0. Adjacent cells (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\". (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0. Their adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,-1 invalid), (5,3), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\". (6,0-5)=0. Their adjacent cells: (5,0-5), (6,-1 invalid), (7,0-5). (5,0-5) are 0,0,0,1,1,1; (7,0-5)=0,0,0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\". (7,0-5)=0. Adjacent cells (6,0-5), (7,-1 invalid), (8,0-5). All uncovered.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (8,0-5)=0. Adjacent cells (7,0-5), (8,-1 invalid), (9,0-5). All uncovered.\n\nRow 9: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (9,2)=0. Adjacent cells (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3). (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=0, (9,1)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=1, (10,2)=0, (10,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 10: \"? 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (10,2)=0. Adjacent cells (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1)=1, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=1, (10,3)=1, (11,1)=1, (11,2)=0, (11,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 11: \"1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (11,2)=0. Adjacent cells (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (11,1), (11,3), (12,1), (12,2), (12,3). (10,1)=1, (10,2)=0, (10,3)=1, (11,1)=1, (11,3)=1, (12,1)=0, (12,2)=0, (12,3)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (12,0-5)=0. Adjacent cells (11,0-5), (12,-1 invalid), (13,0-5). (11,0-5)=1,1,0,1,1,1; (13,0-5)=0,0,0,0,1,1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 13: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\". (13,0-3)=0. Adjacent cells (12,0-3), (13,-1 invalid), (14,0-3). (12,0-3)=0,0,0,0; (14,0-3)=0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 14: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (14,0-3)=0. Adjacent cells (13,0-3), (14,-1 invalid), (15,0-3). (13,0-3)=0,0,0,0; (15,0-3)=0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 15: \"0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (15,0-3)=0. Adjacent cells (14,0-3), (15,-1 invalid), (16,0-3). (14,0-3)=0,0,0,0; (16,0-3)=0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 16: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (16,0-6)=0. Adjacent cells (15,0-6), (16,-1 invalid), (17,0-6). (15,0-6)=0,0,0,0,1,1,1; (17,0-6)=0,0,0,0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 17: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (17,0-7)=0. Adjacent cells (16,0-7), (17,-1 invalid), (18,0-7). (16,0-7)=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1; (18,0-7)=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 18: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (18,0-7)=0. Adjacent cells (17,0-7), (18,-1 invalid), (19,0-7 invalid). (17,0-7)=0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 cells have their adjacent cells already uncovered. So no help there.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is \"?\" and is adjacent to a number where the number of adjacent \"?\" plus flags equals the number. For example, if a cell has a number 2, and there are two \"?\" adjacent to it, and no flags, then those two \"?\" are mines. But if there are flags, then subtract the flags.\n\nTake row 1, (1,13)=2. (1,13)=2: adjacent cells (0,12), (0,13), (0,14), (1,12), (1,14), (2,12), (2,13), (2,14). (1,13)=2. (0,12)=0, (0,13)=1, (0,14)=?, (1,12)=0, (1,14)=?, (2,12)=0, (2,13)=1, (2,14)=?. So (1,13)=2 has three \"?\" adjacent: (0,14), (1,14), (2,14). So 2 mines among them. Not sure.\n\nRow 5, (5,12)=2 and (5,13)=2. (5,12)=2: adjacent cells (4,11), (4,12), (4,13), (5,11), (5,13), (6,11), (6,12), (6,13). (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?. So (5,12)=2 has one flag (F) and one \"?\". So 2-1=1 mine needed, so (6,13) must be a mine. That's a possible mine. So we could flag (6,13). But current flags are 2, and if we flag (6,13), that's 3 flags. But we need to be sure.\n\nIf (6,13) is a mine, then (5,12)=2 (F and ?) would be correct. Also, (5,13)=2: adjacent cells (4,12), (4,13), (4,14), (5,12), (5,14), (6,12), (6,13), (6,14). (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (4,14)=0, (5,12)=2, (5,14)=1, (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?, (6,14)=1. So (5,13)=2 has two mines: F and ?, which would make 2. That fits. So (6,13) is likely a mine. So flagging (6,13) would be a good move. But let's check other areas.\n\nAnother possible mine: row 15, (15,8) is \"?\", (15,9) is \"?\", (15,10) is \"?\". (15,11)=1. (15,11)=1: adjacent cells (14,10), (14,11), (14,12), (15,10), (15,12), (16,10), (16,11), (16,12). (14,10)=?, (14,11)=?, (14,12)=?, (15,10)=?, (15,12)=1, (16,10)=?, (16,11)=1, (16,12)=0. So (15,11)=1 has one mine in those cells. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a \"?\" that is in a corner or edge, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the user has 2 flags, 1 correct. The score is 1\/10=0.1, which matches 0.111 (probably 1\/9, but maybe 1 correct out of 9 flags, but the problem says total mines is 10). Anyway, the user needs to flag 10 mines correctly.\n\nBut maybe instead of flagging, uncovering a safe cell is better. Let's find a \"?\" that is safe. For example, if a number cell has a count of 0, but all 0 cells are already uncovered. So we need to find a cell where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, so the remaining \"?\" are safe.\n\nTake row 2, (2,7)=1. (2,7)=1: adjacent cells (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=1, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=0. So (2,7)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The \"?\" is (1,7). So if (1,7) is a mine, then (2,7)=1 is satisfied. But if (1,7) is not a mine, then (2,7)=1 would have no mines, which is impossible. So (1,7) must be a mine. Wait, no. The count is 1, so exactly one mine in those 8 cells. The adjacent cells are (1,6)=1 (unlikely to be a mine, since 1 is a number), (1,7)=?, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=1, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=0. The 0s are safe, so (3,6-8) are safe. The 1s are numbers, so they are safe (since numbers are uncovered cells showing counts). So the only possible mine is (1,7). Therefore, (1,7) must be a mine. So we should flag (1,7).\n\nLet's verify: (2,7)=1. Its adjacent cells: (1,6) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (1,7) is \"?\", (1,8) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (2,6) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (2,8) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (3,6) is 0 (uncovered, safe), (3,7) is 0 (uncovered, safe), (3,8) is 0 (uncovered, safe). So the only possible mine is (1,7). Therefore, (1,7) is a mine. So flagging (1,7) would be correct.\n\nSimilarly, let's check (1,14)=? in row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\". (1,13)=2. (1,13)=2: adjacent cells (0,12)=0, (0,13)=1, (0,14)=?, (1,12)=0, (1,14)=?, (2,12)=0, (2,13)=1, (2,14)=?. (1,13)=2 needs two mines. The possible mines are (0,14), (1,14), (2,14). Let's check (2,14)=1. (2,14)=1: adjacent cells (1,13)=2, (1,14)=?, (1,15)=2, (2,13)=1, (2,15)=1, (3,13)=1, (3,14)=1, (3,15)=1. So (2,14)=1 has one mine. If (1,14) is a mine, then (2,14)=1 is satisfied. Also, (1,13)=2 would have (1,14) and another mine, say (0,14). But maybe not. But (1,7) is a sure mine.\n\nSo the best action is to flag (1,7).\n\nAnswer: flag (1,7)","flag (1,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to uncover all safe cells or flag all mines. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10, and right now the score is 0.1666, which is 1\/6, but the user says Flags: 3\/18. Wait, maybe that's 3 flags placed, 18 total possible? But the total mines are 10. So the user has placed 3 flags, but only 1 is correct (since 1\/6 is 0.1666). \n\nLooking at the current board, I need to find cells that are either safe to uncover or must be mines. Let's start by analyzing the known numbers and their adjacent cells.\n\nFirst, let's parse the board. The board is 19 rows? Wait, the user wrote 9x9 grid, but the current board has 19 rows. Maybe that's a formatting mistake. Oh, maybe it's a 9x9 grid but displayed as multiple lines. Let me check the rows. Each row has 19 elements? That's odd. Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's assume that maybe the board is 9x9, but the way it's written here is split into lines. Let me count the rows: the Current Board has lines from 0 to 18, which is 19 rows. That's conflicting with the initial statement of a 9x9 grid. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps the actual board is 9x9, and the user pasted it incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe it's a 19x19 grid? But the initial problem says 9x9. Hmm. Maybe it's a formatting error where each row is split into parts. Let's try to see: each line has numbers separated by spaces. Let's count the elements per line. The first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – that's 19 elements. So 19 columns. And 19 rows. So maybe it's a 19x19 grid, but the initial problem statement was wrong? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Well, regardless, I need to work with the given board.\n\nThe user's action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. Let's look for cells that are '?' which are unknown. We need to find which '?' is safe to uncover or must be a mine.\n\nLet's take a row and look for numbers that can help. For example, in row 1 (second line), there's a \"2 ? 2\" – so a cell with 2, then a '?', then 2. Let's say that cell (row 1, column 14) is '?'. The 2s on either side might give clues. Let's say the cell to the left is (1,13) which is 2, and the cell to the right is (1,15) which is 2. The '?' is at (1,14). The 2 at (1,13) has adjacent cells, including (1,14). Similarly, the 2 at (1,15) also includes (1,14). If the 2 at (1,13) has, say, two mines in its adjacent cells, and one of them is (1,14), then (1,14) could be a mine. But maybe not. Let's look for better examples.\n\nLooking at row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\". So row 6, column 12 is F (flagged), column 13 is '?', column 14 is 1. The cell at (6,14) is 1, which means it has one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (6,14) are (5,13), (5,14), (5,15), (6,13), (6,15), (7,13), (7,14), (7,15). (6,14) is 1, so one mine among those. (6,13) is '?', (6,12) is F. (6,12) is flagged, but is it a correct flag? The current score is 1\/6, so maybe that F is incorrect. The cell (5,14) is 1 (from row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\" – row 5, column 14 is 1). The 2 at (5,13) (row 5, column 13 is 2) has adjacent cells. Let's check (5,13) which is 2. Its adjacent cells include (4,12), (4,13), (4,14), (5,12), (5,14), (6,12), (6,13), (6,14). (5,13) is 2, so two mines there. (5,12) is 2 (row 5, column 12 is 2). Let's see, (5,12) is 2, so adjacent cells: (4,11), (4,12), (4,13), (5,11), (5,13), (6,11), (6,12), (6,13). (5,11) is 1 (row 5, column 11 is 1). (6,11) is 1 (row 6, column 11 is 1). (4,11) is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – row 4, column 11 is 0). (4,12) is 0 (row 4, column 12 is 0). (4,13) is 0 (row 4, column 13 is 0). (5,11) is 1, so (5,11) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (5,11) is 1, adjacent cells: (4,10), (4,11), (4,12), (5,10), (5,12), (6,10), (6,11), (6,12). (4,10) is 0 (row 4, column 10 is 0), (4,11) is 0, (4,12) is 0, (5,10) is 0 (row 5, column 10 is 0), (5,12) is 2, (6,10) is 0 (row 6, column 10 is 0), (6,11) is 1, (6,12) is F. So (5,11)=1's adjacent cells: the only possible mine could be (6,12) (F) or (5,12) adjacent. But (5,12)=2, which has two mines. Maybe (6,12) is a mine, which would make (5,11)=1 correct (since (6,12) is adjacent to (5,11)). Then (5,12)=2 would have (6,12) as one mine, and another mine somewhere else, maybe (6,13) (the '?' in row 6, column 13). If (6,13) is a mine, then (5,12)=2 would have two mines: (6,12) and (6,13). Then (5,13)=2 (row 5, column 13) would have adjacent cells: (6,12)=F (mine), (6,13)=mine, so that's two mines, which matches the 2. Then (6,14)=1 (row 6, column 14) has adjacent cells, one of which is (6,13)=mine, so that's the one mine, which matches. So that suggests (6,13) is a mine. But the user has a flag at (6,12), which might be a wrong flag. So maybe (6,12) is not a mine, and (6,13) is. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, in row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The '?' at (0,7) is adjacent to a 1 at (0,6) and (0,8). The 1 at (0,6) has adjacent cells: (0,7) is '?', (1,6) is 1 (row 1, column 6 is 1), (1,7) is F (row 1, column 7 is F). So (0,6)=1: adjacent mines count is 1. The adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=F. So possible mines: (0,7) or (1,7). (1,7) is flagged. If (1,7) is a mine, then (0,6)=1's count is satisfied (since (1,7) is adjacent). Then (0,7) would be safe. Let's check (0,8)=1. (0,8) adjacent cells: (0,7)=?, (0,9)=0, (1,7)=F, (1,8)=1. So (0,8)=1: adjacent mines. If (1,7) is a mine, then that's one mine, so (0,7) is safe. So (0,7) is safe to uncover.\n\nSimilarly, (0,14) is '?'. (0,13)=1 and (0,15)=1. (0,13)=1 adjacent cells: (0,12)=0, (0,14)=?, (1,12)=0, (1,13)=2, (1,14)=?. (1,13)=2: maybe has two mines. If (0,14) is safe, then (0,13)=1's mine could be elsewhere. But maybe (0,7) is a better candidate. Let's confirm (0,7). The cell (0,7) is '?'. (0,6)=1, (0,8)=1. (1,6)=1 (row 1, column 6 is 1), (1,7)=F (row 1, column 7 is F), (1,8)=1 (row 1, column 8 is 1). The 1 at (1,6) has adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=F, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6)=1's adjacent mines: possible (0,7) or (1,7). If (1,7) is a mine, then (1,6)=1's count is 1 (from (1,7)), so (0,7) is safe. Similarly, (1,8)=1's adjacent cells: (0,7)=?, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=0, (1,7)=F, (1,9)=0, (2,7)=1, (2,8)=1, (2,9)=0. So (1,8)=1's adjacent mines: if (1,7) is a mine, that's 1, so (0,7) is safe. Therefore, (0,7) is safe. So uncovering (0,7) would be a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,7)","uncover (0,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.1666, which is 1\/6, but the user says Flags: 3\/18. Wait, maybe that's 3 correct flags out of 18 flagged? The total mines are 10, so we need to find 10 mines.\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to parse the grid. The board is 9x9, but the way it's presented here is as a list of 19 rows? Wait, no, maybe it's a formatting error. Wait, the user probably made a mistake in the board display. Let me check again. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board has 19 rows listed. That must be a mistake. Maybe it's a 19x9 grid? Or perhaps a typo. Alternatively, maybe the board is presented as a single line with spaces, but that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps each line is a row, and there are 19 rows, but that's conflicting with the 9x9 rule. Hmm, maybe it's a mistake in the problem input, but I need to work with what's given.\n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's look again. The current board is written as 19 lines, each with 19 elements (since each line has 0 0 0 ... up to 19 entries). That can't be right. Maybe it's a 19x19 grid? But the problem states 9x9. Oh, perhaps it's a mistake in the problem setup. Maybe the user intended a larger grid but mentioned 9x9 by error. Alternatively, maybe the board is presented as a single line with 9 rows, each row having 9 cells, but the way it's written is split into lines incorrectly. Let's try to make sense of it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is a 19x19 grid, and the initial problem statement's 9x9 is wrong. But the win condition is 10 mines, which is standard for beginner Minesweeper (8x8 has 10 mines, 9x9 is also possible). Maybe the board here is a larger one, but the key is to look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and determine if they can be safely uncovered or flagged.\n\nThe input actions are uncover, flag, unflag. The current score is 0.16666666666666666, which is 1\/6, so that's 1 correct flag out of 6? But the user wrote \"Flags: 3\/18\", which might mean 3 flags placed, 18 total possible? Not sure. The important thing is to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nLooking at the board, let's take a row example. Let's take the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The '?' here is at position (0,14) if rows are 0-indexed. Let's look for numbers that indicate adjacent mines. For example, a cell with '1' means exactly one mine in the 8 surrounding cells. If some of those surrounding cells are flagged (F), that might help.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\". There's an F at (1,7). The cell to the left of F is (1,6) which is 1. So (1,6) is a 1, and (1,7) is F. That means the 1 at (1,6) has exactly one mine in adjacent cells, which is the F at (1,7). So that F is correct. Then, the cell (1,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (1,7) F, so (1,8) being 1 would also have that F as the mine, so that's correct. So that F is a correct flag.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". There's an F at (4,4). Let's check the cell (4,3) which is 1. The adjacent cells to (4,3) are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (4,3) is 1, so there's one mine in those cells. (4,4) is F, so if that's a mine, then that's the only one. So that F is possibly correct.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\". There's an F at (6,12). The cell (6,11) is 1. Adjacent to (6,11) are (5,10), (5,11), (5,12), (6,10), (6,12), (7,10), (7,11), (7,12). (6,11) is 1, so one mine in those. (6,12) is F, so if that's a mine, that's correct.\n\nSo there are 3 F's: (1,7), (4,4), (6,12). The user's Flags: 3\/18 might mean 3 flagged, 18 total cells flagged? Or 3 correct out of 18. The score is 0.16666666666666666, which is 1\/6, so maybe 1 correct out of 6 flags, but that's conflicting. Maybe the score is correct flags \/ total mines (10), so 0.166666 is 1\/6, which would be 1.666 correct flags, which doesn't make sense. Maybe the score is correct flags \/ flags placed. If 3 flags placed, and 1 correct, 1\/3 is 0.333, which is not the case. The given score is 1\/6, so 1 correct flag out of 6 placed. But the user wrote Flags: 3\/18, which is unclear. Maybe it's a typo.\n\nRegardless, let's focus on the board. Let's look for cells that are '?' and see if their adjacent numbers can help. For example, in row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The '?' is at (0,14). The cell to the left of it is (0,13) which is 1. The cell to the right is (0,15) which is 1. Let's see the adjacent cells of (0,13) which is 1. (0,13) is 1, so it has one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,12), (0,14), (1,12), (1,13), (1,14). (0,13) is 1, so one mine among those. (0,14) is '?', (1,13) is 2 (from row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\" so (1,13) is 2). (1,14) is '?'.\n\nRow 1 has (1,13) as 2. The cell (1,13) is 2, so it has two mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,12), (0,13), (0,14), (1,12), (1,14), (2,12), (2,13), (2,14). (0,13) is 1, (1,12) is 0 (row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0\" so (1,12) is 0), (2,13) is 1 (row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" so (2,13) is 1). So (1,13)=2's adjacent cells: let's list them:\n\n(0,12): 0 (row 0, column 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (0,12)=0)\n(0,13): 1 (row 0, column 13: 1)\n(0,14): ? (row 0, column 14)\n(1,12): 0 (row 1, column 12: 0)\n(1,14): ? (row 1, column 14)\n(2,12): 0 (row 2, column 12: 0)\n(2,13): 1 (row 2, column 13: 1)\n(2,14): ? (row 2, column 14: ?)\n\nSo (1,13) is 2, so two mines in these 8 cells. The known cells here are 0, 1, 0, 0, 1. The 1s are (0,13) and (2,13). Wait, (0,13) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. So the 1 at (0,13) indicates that cell has 1 mine around it, but it's not a mine itself. So the adjacent cells of (1,13) that are possible mines are the '?' cells: (0,14), (1,14), (2,14). Let's call these three cells A, B, C.\n\nNow, (0,13) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,12)=0, (0,14)=A, (1,12)=0, (1,13)=2, (1,14)=B. So (0,13) has adjacent cells: (0,12), (0,14), (1,12), (1,13), (1,14). So the mine count for (0,13) is 1. The cells here that could be mines are A and B. Because (0,12) and (1,12) are 0, so no mines there. (1,13) is 2, which is a number, not a mine. So (0,13) has 1 mine in A or B.\n\nSimilarly, (2,13) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,12)=0, (1,13)=2, (1,14)=B, (2,12)=0, (2,14)=C, (3,12)=0 (row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" → (3,12)=0), (3,13)=1 (row 3, column 13: 1), (3,14)=1 (row 3, column 14: 1). So (2,13) is 1, so its adjacent mines are in B, C, or (3,13) or (3,14). But (3,13) and (3,14) are 1 and 1, which are numbers, so not mines. So (2,13) has 1 mine in B or C.\n\nNow, (1,13)=2 needs two mines in A, B, C. From (0,13)=1, we have 1 mine in A or B. From (2,13)=1, we have 1 mine in B or C. Let's denote:\n\nLet x = number of mines in A (0 or 1)\ny = number of mines in B (0 or 1)\nz = number of mines in C (0 or 1)\n\nFrom (0,13)=1: x + y = 1\nFrom (2,13)=1: y + z = 1\nFrom (1,13)=2: x + y + z = 2\n\nSubstituting x = 1 - y from first equation into third: (1 - y) + y + z = 2 → 1 + z = 2 → z = 1. Then from second equation, y + 1 = 1 → y = 0. Then x = 1 - 0 = 1. So x=1, y=0, z=1. So A (0,14) is a mine, B (1,14) is safe, C (2,14) is a mine.\n\nSo (1,14) is safe, so we can uncover it. Let's check the coordinates. Row 1, column 14. The row indices are 0-based, so row 1 is the second line. The columns are 0-based, so the 15th element (since starting from 0) is column 14. So the cell (1,14) is '?', and according to the logic, it's safe. So we can uncover (1,14).\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,14)","uncover (1,14)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.166..., which is 1\/6, so they have 1 correct flag out of 3 flagged. The board is 9x9, but looking at the current board, maybe the user pasted it in a way that each line is a row? Let me check the rows. Wait, the current board has 19 rows listed, which doesn't make sense for a 9x9 grid. Oh, maybe that's a formatting error. Let's assume each line is a row, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in presenting the board. But regardless, let's focus on the input commands.\n\nThe user's task is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Let's look at the current board. The board has cells with numbers, F (flags), ?, and numbers. The '?' are unknown cells. The F's are flagged as mines. The score is 1\/6, so 1 correct flag, 2 incorrect. So 3 flags total, 1 right, 2 wrong. Need to unflag the wrong ones or flag the right ones.\n\nFirst, let's check the flagged cells. Let's find all the F's in the board. Scanning through:\n\nRow 1 (second line): 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 → F at (1,7) [assuming rows start at 0]\n\nRow 4 (fifth line): 1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → F at (4,4)\n\nRow 6 (seventh line): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0 → F at (6,12) [Wait, but 9x9 grid should have columns 0-8. Oh, this must be a formatting mistake. The user probably pasted the board incorrectly, maybe each row is split into multiple parts. That's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a 19x19 grid? But the rules say 9x9. So perhaps the board is presented with each row as a line, but the columns are 0-8. Let's assume that each row is 9 characters. Let's re-express the current board properly.\n\nWait, the user might have made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's try to parse it correctly. The 9x9 grid should have 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's check the original input:\n\nCurrent Board:\nLine 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 → Maybe this is row 0, but 19 elements? That's not 9. So perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe each line is a row, but the columns are 0-8, and the rest are typos. Let's ignore the extra numbers and focus on the 9x9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended to present the board with each cell separated by spaces, but there are 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's count: 19 lines under \"Current Board\" — that's 19 rows, which is impossible. So this is likely a formatting error. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the user pasted it with each row split into multiple lines. For example, row 0 might be \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" (columns 0-8), then the next part is \"0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the best move is to uncover a cell that's safe. Since the game ends if you uncover a mine, we need to find a cell that's definitely safe. Let's think about Minesweeper logic. For example, if a cell with number 1 has only one unknown cell adjacent, that unknown cell is a mine. But with the current board's formatting issues, it's hard to analyze.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has 3 flags, 1 correct, 2 incorrect, maybe some of the F's are wrong. For example, if a flagged cell is adjacent to a number that's lower than the number of adjacent flags, that flag is wrong. But again, without a clear board, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user should unflag a wrong flag. The score is 1\/6, so 1 correct, 2 incorrect. Unflagging a wrong flag would reduce the flags to 2, but the score would be 1\/2 (if the unflagged was incorrect). But the problem is, how to know which F is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's known to be safe. For example, if a cell with number 0 has adjacent cells that are all uncovered, then the adjacent ? cells are safe. But again, without a clear board, it's hard.\n\nGiven the confusion in the board presentation, perhaps the intended answer is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. Let's look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, in Minesweeper, if a cell shows 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if there's a 0 next to a '?', that '?' can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at the first line: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — maybe the first 9 cells are row 0: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]. Then row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,F,1]. Row 2: [1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1]. Row 3: [?,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]. Row 4: [1,1,0,1,F,1,0,0,0]. Row 5: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]. Row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. That's a possible 9x9 grid. Let's assume that.\n\nIn row 0, columns 0-5 are 0s. So cell (0,0) is 0, (0,1) is 0, up to (0,5) is 0. These 0 cells mean all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,0) is 0, so all 8 neighbors are safe. But (0,0) is already uncovered (since it's 0). The cell (0,5) is 0. Its neighbors are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6) is 1, which is uncovered. (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. So maybe the ? in row 3, column 0 (since row 3 is [?,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0]) — (3,0) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (3,1) is 1. The 1 at (3,1) has neighbors. Let's list (3,1)'s neighbors: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,1) is 1, so exactly one of these is a mine. (2,0) is 1 (row 2, column 0), (2,1) is 1, (2,2) is 0, (3,0) is ?, (3,2) is 0, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 0. So the 1 at (3,1) has neighbors: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0. The 1 indicates there's 1 mine in these 8. The cells that are numbers (already uncovered) can't be mines, so the only possible mine is (3,0). So (3,0) must be a mine. Wait, but (3,0) is '?', so if (3,1) is 1, and all other neighbors are uncovered (and thus safe), then (3,0) must be a mine. So we should flag (3,0). But the user has 3 flags, 1 correct. Maybe (3,0) is a mine, so flagging it would increase correct flags.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 1, column 7 is F (flagged). Let's check the cell (1,6) which is 1. (1,6) is 1, so its neighbors are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=0, (0,6)=1, (0,7)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=F (flagged as mine), (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So (1,6) is 1, which means there should be 1 mine in its 8 neighbors. The flagged cell (1,7) is a neighbor. If (1,7) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine, which matches the 1. So that flag might be correct.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is F. Let's check (4,3) which is 1. (4,3) has neighbors: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=F, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. (4,3) is 1, so there's 1 mine in neighbors. If (4,4) is a mine, that's 1, which matches. So that flag might be correct.\n\nRow 6, column 12 is F, but that's beyond 8 columns, so probably a formatting error. So maybe there are 3 flags: (1,7), (4,4), and another one. If two of them are correct (based on the 1's adjacent), then the third is incorrect. The score is 1\/6, which is 1 correct out of 3 flags, so two are wrong. So maybe (1,7) and (4,4) are wrong. For example, (1,6) is 1, but if (1,7) is not a mine, then the mine must be elsewhere. But (1,6)'s neighbors: (0,5)=0 (safe), (0,6)=1 (safe), (0,7)=1 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=1 (safe), (2,7)=1 (safe). So all neighbors except (1,7) are safe, so (1,7) must be a mine. So that flag is correct. Similarly, (4,3)=1, neighbors are (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. All safe except (4,4), so (4,4) must be a mine. So that flag is correct. Then the third flag is the one in row 6, which is probably a formatting error, so maybe it's a wrong flag. So unflag that. But without knowing the exact position, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since the user needs to make a move, and the best move is to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a cell that's a '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, in row 0, columns 0-5 are 0s. The cell (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But those are already uncovered (since they are 0s). Let's look for a 0 cell whose adjacent cells include a '?'. For example, row 2, column 2 is 0. Its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1. All these are uncovered (numbers), so no '?' here.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 0. Its neighbors: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 2 is 0. Neighbors: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is 0. Neighbors: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo maybe the '?' cells are in positions where we can't determine safety easily. Alternatively, the user has to make a guess. Since the game ends at 100th epoch, but we need to make a move. Let's pick a '?' that's adjacent to a low number. For example, in row 3, column 0 is '?'. Let's assume that's (3,0). If we uncover (3,0), if it's a mine, the game ends. But based on earlier analysis, (3,1) is 1, and its neighbors are mostly uncovered, so (3,0) might be a mine. So maybe better to flag it. But the user has 3 flags, 1 correct. Alternatively, let's look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 1 with multiple unknowns, so it's safe. For example, a cell with number 2 that has two '?' adjacent, so those are mines. But without clear data, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, the answer might be to uncover (3,0), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the best move is to unflag a wrong flag. For example, if there's a flag that's in a position where the adjacent number is 0, which can't have a mine. But if a cell is 0, all adjacent are safe, so any flag adjacent to a 0 is wrong. Let's check if any F is adjacent to a 0. For example, (1,7) is F. The cell (1,6) is 1, not 0. (4,4) is F. The cell (4,3) is 1, not 0. So no. Maybe the third flag is in a 0 adjacent area. But due to formatting issues, it's unclear.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. Let's pick (0,0) but it's already 0. How about (3,0)? If (3,1) is 1, and (3,0) is the only unknown neighbor, then (3,0) is a mine, so uncovering it would lose. So better not. Maybe (5,5) is 1. Its neighbors: (4,4)=F, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=1, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. (5,5) is 1, so there's 1 mine in neighbors. (4,4) is flagged, so if that's a mine, then it's correct. So (5,5) is 1, which is already satisfied by (4,4) being a mine. So no new info.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 2. For example, if a 2 has two '?'s, those are mines. But without clear data, it's hard. Given the time, I'll have to make a guess. Let's say the answer is to uncover (3,0), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe (0,5) is 0, and adjacent to (0,6)=1. No, (0,6) is 1. Maybe (2,5) is 0. Its neighbors: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,4)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=0. All uncovered. So no '?' there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the '?' in row 0, column 13 (from the original board) is (0,13), but that's beyond 9x9. So perhaps the best move is to flag a mine that's certain. For example, if (3,0) is a mine, flag it. So action: 'flag (3,0)'. But the user has 3 flags, 1 correct. If (3,0) is a mine, then correct flags become 2, score 2\/6=0.333. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the answer is to uncover a cell that's safe. Let's pick (5,6) which is 0. But it's already uncovered. Maybe (6,6) is 0. Uncover (6,6) but it's already 0. I'm stuck. Maybe the answer is to uncover (3,4). Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user mentioned that there are 10 mines in total, and the current score is 0.16666666666666666, which is 1\/6, so they've correctly flagged 1 mine so far. The flags count is 3\/18, meaning they've placed 3 flags, but only 1 is correct, 2 are incorrect.\n\nLooking at the board, each row is a row of the 9x9 grid. Wait, the current board has 19 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, maybe the user pasted the board incorrectly. Wait, the Minesweeper board is supposed to be 9x9, but here there are 19 rows listed. That's probably a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input says \"Current Board:\" followed by 19 lines, each with 19 elements? That can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Let me assume that it's a 9x9 grid, perhaps the numbers are separated by spaces, and each row is a line. Let me count: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 – that's 19 elements per line. That's definitely not 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Alternatively, maybe it's a 19x19 grid, but the problem statement says 9x9. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, and the user made a mistake in the number of rows. Let's try to ignore that for a moment. The key is to find a cell to uncover that's safe, or to flag a mine, but since the score is based on correctly flagged mines, and the user has 3 flags but only 1 correct, maybe some flags are wrong.\n\nBut the main goal is to either uncover safe cells or flag mines. Let's think about Minesweeper logic. For example, if a cell shows a number, that's the count of adjacent mines. So, if a cell has a '1' and has one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. Or if a cell has a '2' and two adjacent '?', those are mines.\n\nLooking at the current board (assuming rows are 0-8 and columns 0-8, even though the data is messy), but perhaps the user intended the board to be 9x9. Let's take a sample row, say row 1: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\" – maybe the 'F' is a flagged cell. Let's suppose that in row 1, column 7 is flagged (since it's the 8th element, index 7). The cell to the left is 1, right is 1. So if that F is a mine, then the 1s adjacent to it would have that mine counted. But if the 1s have other adjacent ? cells, maybe that F is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a cell with number 0 is uncovered, all adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered. But in the given board, there are 0s, so maybe their adjacent cells are safe. For example, the first row has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – maybe the 0s in the first few columns mean their adjacent cells are safe. But without knowing the exact grid structure, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Since the problem requires an action, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. For example, in Minesweeper, cells adjacent to 0s are safe. So if there's a 0, all 8 surrounding cells are safe and can be uncovered. Let's assume that in the current board, there are 0s, so their adjacent ? cells are safe.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – the first six 0s. If those are in row 0, columns 0-5, then their adjacent cells (row 1, columns 0-5) should also be 0 or safe. But row 1 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\" – which also has 0s in columns 0-5, so maybe those are all safe, and their adjacent cells (row 2, columns 0-5) are also 0. So maybe the ? cells in other parts of the board are the ones to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cell at (3,4) is a good candidate. Wait, the example input uses 'uncover (3,4)'. But why? Let me check the current board for row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" – row 3, column 0 is ?, column 1 is 1, column 2 is 0. A 0 in column 2 (row 3, column 2) means all adjacent cells (row 2, column 1-3; row 3, column 1-3; row 4, column 1-3) are safe. So the cell (3,0) is adjacent to (3,2) which is 0. Therefore, (3,0) is a ? and adjacent to a 0, so it's safe. So uncovering (3,0) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3,4) is a flagged cell. Looking at row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – row 4, column 4 is F (flagged). If that F is a wrong flag, then unflagging it might help, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the score is based on correct flags, so wrong flags lower the score. But the user's action can be to uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is a '?' and adjacent to a number that indicates it's safe. For example, if a cell has a number 1, and there's only one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. If a cell has a number 1 and two adjacent '?', then one is a mine. But if a cell has a number 0, all adjacent '?' are safe.\n\nAssuming that in row 3, column 2 is 0 (from \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"), then the cell (3,2) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells would be (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Let's check those:\n\n- (2,1): row 2 is \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – column 1 is 1.\n- (2,2): column 2 is 0.\n- (2,3): column 3 is 0.\n- (3,1): column 1 is 1.\n- (3,3): column 3 is 1.\n- (4,1): row 4 is \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" – column 1 is 1.\n- (4,2): column 2 is 0.\n- (4,3): column 3 is 1.\n\nSo the 0 at (3,2) has adjacent cells that are all numbers, so maybe the ? cells around other 0s are safe. For example, row 0 has a lot of 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. Let's pick a ? cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 14 is '?', but maybe that's in a different part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in a 0 area. For example, row 0, columns 0-5 are 0s. The cell (0,0) is 0, so (1,0) is 0, (0,1) is 0, etc. So any ? in that area is safe. But looking at row 0: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" – column 14 is '?'. Let's say (0,14) is a ?. What's the adjacent cell to (0,14)? The cell to the left is 1 (column 13), right is 1 (column 15). So the 1 at (0,13) has adjacent cells including (0,14) (which is ?) and maybe others. If (0,13) is 1, and the number of adjacent mines is 1, then if there's only one ? adjacent to it, that's a mine. But if there are more, then maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the flags. The user has 3 flags, 1 correct. So two are wrong. For example, row 1, column 7 is F. Let's say (1,7) is flagged. The cell (1,6) is 1, (1,8) is 1. So the 1 at (1,6) has adjacent cells including (1,7) (F) and others. If (1,6) is 1, and (1,7) is a mine, then that 1 is accounted for. But if (1,6) has other adjacent ? cells, maybe (1,7) is not a mine. For example, (0,6) is 1, (2,6) is 1. So (1,6) is 1, adjacent to (0,6)=1, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,7)=F, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So the 1 at (1,6) has adjacent cells: (0,6)=1 (safe), (0,7)=1 (safe), (0,8)=1 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe), (1,7)=F (flagged), (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=1 (safe), (2,7)=1 (safe). So the 1 at (1,6) must have exactly 1 mine in those adjacent cells. The only possible mine is (1,7) (F). So if (1,7) is a mine, that's correct. But if (1,7) is not a mine, then the 1 at (1,6) would have 0 mines, which is a contradiction. So maybe (1,7) is a correct flag. But the user's score is 1\/6, so maybe another flag is wrong.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is F. Let's check (4,4). The cell (4,3) is 1, (4,5) is 1. The cell (3,3) is 1, (5,3) is 1, (5,4) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So (4,4) is flagged. The cell (4,3)=1: adjacent cells include (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=F, (4,2)=0, (4,4)=F, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=1. So the 1 at (4,3) has adjacent cells. The possible mines here are (3,4) and (4,4). If (4,3) is 1, then there should be 1 mine in those adjacent cells. If both (3,4) and (4,4) are flagged, but (4,3) is 1, that would mean only one of them is a mine. So if (4,4) is flagged, maybe it's a wrong flag, and (3,4) is the mine. So maybe (4,4) is a wrong flag, and should be unflagged. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet.\n\nRow 6, column 12 is F. Let's say (6,12) is F. The cell (6,11) is 1, (6,13) is '?'. The cell (5,11)=1, (5,12)=2, (5,13)=2, (7,11)=1, (7,12)=2, (7,13)=2. So (6,11)=1: adjacent cells include (5,10)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,12)=2, (6,10)=0, (6,12)=F, (7,10)=0, (7,11)=1, (7,12)=2. So the 1 at (6,11) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only possible mine is (6,12) (F). So if that's correct, then (6,12) is a mine. But the user has 3 flags, so maybe two are wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let's focus on uncovering a safe cell. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, in row 3, column 0 is '?'. The cell (3,2) is 0. The distance between (3,0) and (3,2) is two columns apart. In Minesweeper, a 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So (3,2) is 0, so (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are all safe. But (3,0) is two columns left of (3,2), so it's not adjacent to (3,2). So (3,0) is not adjacent to the 0, so maybe not safe.\n\nAnother 0: row 1, column 0-5 are 0s. The cell (1,0)=0, so (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) are all safe. Those are already uncovered (since they are 0s). So maybe the ? cells are in other areas.\n\nLooking at row 6: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – column 13 is '?'. The cell (6,12) is F, (6,14)=1. The cell (6,11)=1. The 1 at (6,11) has adjacent cells, one of which is (6,12)=F (mine). The 1 at (6,14) has adjacent cells including (6,13)=? and (6,15)=1. So (6,14)=1: adjacent cells are (5,13)=2, (5,14)=1, (5,15)=0, (6,13)=?, (6,15)=1, (7,13)=2, (7,14)=1, (7,15)=0. So the 1 at (6,14) must have 1 mine in those. If (6,13) is a mine, then that's the 1. So (6,13) could be a mine, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's a '?' and has multiple 0s around it. For example, row 0, column 0-5 are 0s. The cell (0,5) is 0. Adjacent cells to (0,5) are (0,4)=0, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. So (0,5) is 0, so (1,5) is 0 (which it is), (0,6)=1 is safe. So the 1 at (0,6) has adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=1, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=F, (1,8)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=1. So the 1 at (0,6) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells. The possible mine is (1,7)=F. So if (1,7) is a mine, that's correct. So maybe that's one correct flag.\n\nThe user's score is 1\/6, which is 1 correct flag out of 10 total. So they have 3 flags, 1 correct, 2 incorrect. So they need to flag the remaining 9 mines, but first, maybe uncover safe cells to get more info.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell has a number N, and there are N flagged cells around it, then the remaining '?' around it are safe. For example, if a cell is 2, and there are 2 flags around it, then all other '?' around it are safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 13 is 2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\" – row 1, column 13 is 2. Let's say (1,13)=2. Adjacent cells would include (0,12)=0, (0,13)=1, (0,14)=?, (1,12)=0, (1,14)=2, (2,12)=0, (2,13)=1, (2,14)=?. So (1,13)=2: adjacent cells. How many flags are around it? None, because the flags are at (1,7), (4,4), (6,12). So (1,13)=2 has 0 flags around it, so there are 2 mines in the adjacent '?'. So the '?' at (0,14) and (2,14) could be mines. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a '?' that is in an area with a lot of 0s, so it's likely safe. For example, row 3, column 0 is '?'. Let's assume that (3,0) is a '?'. What's around it? The cell (3,1)=1. The 1 at (3,1) has adjacent cells: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=0, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0. So the 1 at (3,1) has adjacent cells. The possible mines here are (3,0) and (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), (4,1). Since (2,2)=0 and (3,2)=0, (4,2)=0, those are safe. So the 1 at (3,1) must have 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If (3,0) is a mine, then that's the 1. If not, then one of the other cells (2,0), (2,1), (4,0), (4,1) is a mine. But those cells are already uncovered as 1s, which means they have their own adjacent mines. So (2,0)=1: adjacent cells would include (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,-1) invalid, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0. So (2,0)=1 has adjacent cells. The 1 at (2,0) must have 1 mine. Possible mines: (3,0)=? or (2,1)=1 (but (2,1) is 1, which is a number, not a mine). So (2,0)=1's adjacent mine is (3,0)=?. So (3,0) is a mine? That would mean (3,0) is a mine, so flagging it. But the user needs to flag mines. Alternatively, if (3,0) is not a mine, then (2,0)=1's mine is elsewhere, but (2,0) is on the edge, so maybe (3,0) is the mine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Let's say row 2, column 2 is 0 (from row 2: \"1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\"). So (2,2)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1. All of these are uncovered (0 or 1), so no ? cells adjacent to (2,2)=0. So no help there.\n\nAnother 0: row 4, column 2 is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"). (4,2)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,1)=1, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=1. All uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 0 0\"). (5,11)=1, (5,12)=2, (5,13)=2, (5,14)=1. The 2 at (5,12) has adjacent cells. Let's say (5,12)=2. Adjacent cells: (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0, (4,13)=0, (5,11)=1, (5,13)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=F, (6,13)=?. So (5,12)=2 has adjacent cells. The flagged cell (6,12)=F is one mine, so there should be another mine. The '?' at (6,13) could be the second mine. So (6,13) is a mine, so flagging it. But the user has 3 flags, maybe they should flag (6,13).\n\nAlternatively, the user needs to uncover a safe cell. Let's pick a '?' that's in a 0 area. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, so (0,0) is safe, but it's already uncovered. The '?' cells are in other areas. Let's say row 14, column 5 is '?' (from row 14: \"0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\"). But without knowing the exact grid, it's hard.\n\nGiven the confusion in the board display, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe, like (3,0) which is a '?' and adjacent to a 1, but maybe not a mine. Alternatively, the example given in the problem uses 'uncover (3,4)', but (3,4) in row 3: \"? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" – column 4 is 1. So (3,4)=1. Uncovering (3,4) is already uncovered, so that's not right.\n\nWait, maybe the board rows are 0-18, but that's 19 rows, which is not 9x9. There's a mistake here. Given that, perhaps the best guess is to uncover a '?' cell that's adjacent to a 0. Let's say (3,0) is a '?', so 'uncover (3,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)"],"unflags":0,"seed":5,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Wait, the problem says the board is a 9x9 grid, but the current board display here is showing 16 rows of 16 '?' each. That might be a mistake, but maybe it's a typo. Anyway, the standard Minesweeper 9x9 has 10 mines.\n\nFirst move in Minesweeper is usually a corner or edge, but since all cells are unknown, any first move is safe. Because in Minesweeper, the first click never hits a mine. So I can choose any cell. Let's pick (0,0) as a common first move. Or maybe the center? But (0,0) is easy. So I'll go with uncover (0,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The board is 9x9, but the displayed current board seems to have rows 0 to 8, each with 15 columns? Wait, maybe that's a formatting issue. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user input has a typo, but the standard Minesweeper is 9x9. Let's assume each row has 9 cells. The current board shows some uncovered cells with numbers and some '?' which are unknown, and 'F' would be flags, but there are none yet since Flags are 0\/23 (maybe that's a typo, total mines are 10).\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Let's look at the uncovered cells to find safe moves. Let's list the coordinates (row, col) with their numbers. Let's index rows from 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nRow 0: 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\nRow 1: 0, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\nRow 2: 0, 0, 1, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?\nRow 3: 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 4: 0, 1, ?, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 5: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 6: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 7: 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 8: ?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?\n\nWait, maybe the columns are 0-8. Let's parse each row correctly. For example, row 0 has cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, etc.\n\nLet's look for cells with 0, which mean all adjacent cells are safe. Uncovering a 0 cell automatically uncovers all adjacent cells, but if a cell is already uncovered, we can look at adjacent '?' cells.\n\nStarting with row 0, columns 0-2 are 0s. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) which are all 0, so those are safe. The next cell in row 0, column 3 is 1. So (0,3) has 1 mine around it. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?.\n\nRow 1, columns 0-1 are 0s. (1,0) is 0, adjacent cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, all safe. (1,2)=1: adjacent cells (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,1)=0, (0,1)=0. So (1,2) has 1 mine, possibly in (2,3) since (1,3)=2.\n\nRow 2, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1. (2,3)=? (since it's '?' in row 2: \"0 0 1 ? 2 1 1 ? ?\"), so (2,3) is unknown. (2,4)=2: adjacent cells (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=?, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1.\n\nRow 3: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. (3,5)=0: adjacent cells are all safe. So cells around (3,5)=0 (which is (row 3, column 5)): (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. Since (3,5) is 0, all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. Wait, no: a cell with 0 means there are 0 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. So (3,5)=0 implies that (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) all have 0 mines. Let's check those:\n\n(2,4)=2: but (3,5)=0 says (2,4) is adjacent to (3,5), so (2,4) is a neighbor of (3,5). Wait, (3,5) is row 3, column 5. Its neighbors are:\n\nrow 2, column 4 (2,4)\n\nrow 2, column 5 (2,5)\n\nrow 2, column 6 (2,6)\n\nrow 3, column 4 (3,4)\n\nrow 3, column 6 (3,6)\n\nrow 4, column 4 (4,4)\n\nrow 4, column 5 (4,5)\n\nrow 4, column 6 (4,6)\n\nSo (3,5)=0 means none of these 8 cells are mines. But (2,4) is a cell with value 2, which is a number, so it's already uncovered. So that's okay. The cells that are '?' in this list would be safe to uncover. Let's see which of these neighbors are '?'. \n\nLooking at row 2: (2,4)=2 (uncovered), (2,5)=1 (uncovered), (2,6)=1 (uncovered). So those are numbers. Row 3: (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,6)=1 (uncovered). Row 4: (4,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,5)=0 (uncovered), (4,6)=1 (uncovered). So none of the neighbors of (3,5)=0 are '?', so that doesn't help.\n\nLet's look at row 4, (4,5)=0: adjacent cells. (4,5) is row 4, column 5. Its neighbors are (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All of these are uncovered (numbers or 0), so no '?' there.\n\nRow 5, (5,5)=0: neighbors (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, (6,5)=0: neighbors (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, (7,5)=0: neighbors (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1 are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that can help us determine safe cells or mines. For example, (0,3)=1 (row 0, column 3). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2)=0 (safe), (0,4)=? (unknown), (1,2)=1 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=? (unknown). The other adjacent cells are (0,3) is at top, so no row -1. So the 8 neighbors are: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (since row 0, column 3: up is none, down is row 1, left is column 2, right is column 4; so neighbors are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), and (maybe (0,3) is top row, so no row -1, and column 3 is not the first or last, so left is 2, right is 4. So 5 neighbors? Wait, in Minesweeper, each cell has up to 8 neighbors: top-left, top, top-right, left, right, bottom-left, bottom, bottom-right. So (0,3) is row 0, column 3. Its neighbors are:\n\nrow -1 (invalid), column 2: invalid\n\nrow -1, column 3: invalid\n\nrow -1, column 4: invalid\n\nrow 0, column 2: (0,2)=0\n\nrow 0, column 4: (0,4)=?\n\nrow 1, column 2: (1,2)=1\n\nrow 1, column 3: (1,3)=2\n\nrow 1, column 4: (1,4)=?\n\nSo total 5 neighbors. The cell (0,3)=1 means exactly 1 mine among these 5 neighbors. The known neighbors (0,2)=0 (safe), (1,2)=1 (safe, it's a number, not a mine), (1,3)=2 (safe, number). So the mines must be in (0,4) or (1,4). So between these two, exactly 1 is a mine.\n\nNow (1,3)=2 (row 1, column 3). Its neighbors are:\n\n(0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=?,\n\n(1,2)=1, (1,4)=?,\n\n(2,2)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=2.\n\nSo 8 neighbors. (1,3)=2 means 2 mines here. Known safe cells: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1 (number), (1,2)=1 (number), (2,2)=1 (number), (2,4)=2 (number). So the possible mine locations are (0,4)=?, (1,4)=?, (2,3)=?.\n\nFrom (0,3)=1, we know there's 1 mine in (0,4) and (1,4). Let's call that x + y = 1, where x is mine in (0,4), y in (1,4).\n\n(1,3)=2: the mines in its neighbors are x (0,4) + y (1,4) + z (2,3) = 2. Since x + y = 1, then 1 + z = 2 → z = 1. So (2,3) must be a mine. That's a key insight!\n\nSo (2,3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,3). Wait, but let's confirm. Let's recheck:\n\n(0,3) has 5 neighbors: (0,2)=0 (safe), (0,4)=?, (1,2)=1 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=?. The count is 1, so 1 mine in (0,4) and (1,4).\n\n(1,3) has 8 neighbors: (0,2)=0 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (0,4)=?, (1,2)=1 (safe), (1,4)=?, (2,2)=1 (safe), (2,3)=?, (2,4)=2 (safe). The count is 2, so 2 mines in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3).\n\nSince (0,3) requires 1 mine in (0,4) and (1,4), then (1,3) has 2 mines: 1 from (0,4)\/(1,4) plus 1 from (2,3). So (2,3) must be a mine. That makes sense. So (2,3) is a mine. So we should flag (2,3).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell to confirm. Let's look at (2,2)=1 (row 2, column 2). Its neighbors are:\n\n(1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2,\n\n(2,1)=0, (2,3)=?,\n\n(3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2.\n\n(2,2)=1 means 1 mine in these 8 neighbors. Known safe cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. So only (2,3)=? is unknown. So (2,2)=1 implies that (2,3) is the only possible mine, so (2,3) must be a mine. Yes! That's a confirmation. Because (2,2) has 1 mine, and all other neighbors are safe (numbers), so (2,3) must be the mine. Perfect, that's a definite mine.\n\nSo we should flag (2,3). Let's check the coordinates: row 2, column 3. The input format is 'flag (row, col)'. So the action should be 'flag (2,3)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (2,3)","flag (2,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed here seems a bit off—maybe it's a typo, but I'll assume it's a 15x15 grid as shown, but the Minesweeper rules usually are 9x9. Wait, the initial problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the current board display is a formatting error. Let me check the input again. The user provided a current board with 15 rows, each with 15 elements. That's probably a mistake, but maybe it's just a formatting issue. Let's focus on the 9x9 part.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the visible cells. The rows are numbered 0-8, columns 0-8. Let's list out the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?] (column 3 is flagged)\nRow 3: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, ?, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] (column 2 is unknown)\nRow 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\n\nThe flags: there's 1 flag (F) at (2,3). The score is 1\/23, but total mines are 10, so that's probably a typo. The user's current flags are 1, and they need to flag all 10 mines. The win condition is to flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nStarting with row 2, column 3 is flagged (F). Let's check its neighbors. The cell (2,3) is flagged, so we assume it's a mine. Let's see the surrounding cells to confirm if that's a correct flag.\n\nLooking at cell (2,2) which is 1. The 1 at (2,2) has 8 neighbors: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The value 1 means there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. We know (2,3) is flagged (mine), so the other 7 cells must be safe. So (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are all safe. Let's check if that's consistent with other cells.\n\nCell (1,3) is 2. Let's check (1,3) which is 2. Its neighbors are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). The value 2 means 2 mines here. We know (2,3) is a mine (flagged), so there's 1 more mine in these 8 cells. The cell (2,2) is 1, which we already considered. Let's see (2,4) which is 2. The cell (2,4) is 2. Its neighbors: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since (2,3) is a mine, the 2 at (2,4) means there's 1 more mine in these neighbors. \n\nCell (3,3) is 2. Let's check (3,3): neighbors (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The value 2: we know (2,3) is a mine, so there's 1 more mine here. \n\nCell (3,5) is 0. That's a safe cell with 0 mines around, so all 8 neighbors are safe. Let's list (3,5)'s neighbors: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Since (3,5) is 0, all these cells are safe. So (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are all safe. That's important.\n\nLooking at (4,5) which is 0. Its neighbors are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). Since (4,5) is 0, all neighbors are safe. That aligns with (3,5) being 0.\n\nCell (3,6) is 1. Its neighbors: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (3,5) and (4,5) are 0, so (2,5), (2,6), (4,6) are safe (from (3,5) 0), so the 1 at (3,6) must have 1 mine in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nCell (4,6) is 1. Its neighbors: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (5,6) are safe (from 0s), so the 1 at (4,6) must have 1 mine in (3,6), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). But (3,6) is 1, which we already considered.\n\nNow, let's look at row 4, column 2 (4,2) which is '?'. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cell (4,2) is adjacent to (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1. Let's check (3,2)=2. The cell (3,2) has neighbors (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1. The value 2 means 2 mines in these 8. We know (2,3) is a mine, so there's 1 more mine here. The possible cells are (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1). But (2,2) is 1, which has (2,3) as its only mine (from earlier analysis), so (2,2) is safe. (3,1) is 1: neighbors (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (3,0)=0, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?. The 1 at (3,1) has 1 mine. Since (2,2) is 1, which we know has (2,3) as mine, (3,1)'s mine could be (3,2) or (4,2). But (3,2) is 2, which we're considering.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (4,3)=1. (4,3) has neighbors (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0. The value 1 means 1 mine here. (4,4) is 0, so (3,4), (5,4) are safe. (3,3)=2, which has (2,3) as a mine. So (4,3)'s mine could be (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (5,2), (5,3). But (5,2)=1 and (5,3)=1. Let's check (5,2)=1: neighbors (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0. The 1 here must have 1 mine. The 0s at (6,1-3) are safe, so (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3) are possible. (5,1)=1: neighbors (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?, (5,0)=0, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0. The 1 here must have 1 mine, so possible in (4,1), (4,2), (5,2).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0s. Let's find all 0 cells and their neighbors.\n\nRow 3, column 5 (3,5) is 0. So all 8 neighbors are safe: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). These cells are safe, so we can uncover them. Let's check if any of these are currently '?'. Looking at the current board:\n\nRow 2, columns 4-6: [2,1,1]. So (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1 (already uncovered). Row 3, columns 4-6: [1,0,1]. (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,6)=1 (uncovered). Row 4, columns 4-6: [0,0,1]. (4,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,5)=0 (uncovered), (4,6)=1 (uncovered). So the neighbors of (3,5) are all already uncovered. \n\nNext, row 4, column 4 (4,4) is 0. Its neighbors: (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All these are already uncovered, so no new info.\n\nRow 5, column 4 (5,4)=0, row 5, column 5 (5,5)=0, row 6, columns 0-5 are 0s. Let's check row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,...]. So (6,0) to (6,5) are 0s. Their neighbors are all safe. For example, (6,0)=0: neighbors (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=?, (7,1)=2. Since (6,0) is 0, (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1) are safe. Wait, (5,0)=0 (row 5, column 0: 0), (5,1)=1 (row 5, column 1: 1), (6,1)=0 (row 6, column 1: 0), (7,0) is '?' (row 7, column 0), (7,1)=2 (row 7, column 1: 2). So (7,0) is a neighbor of (6,0) which is 0, so (7,0) is safe. Therefore, (7,0) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's confirm: (6,0) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The 8 neighbors are:\n\n(5,-1) invalid, (5,0), (5,1), (6,-1) invalid, (6,1), (7,-1) invalid, (7,0), (7,1). So valid neighbors are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). All of these are safe. (5,0) is 0 (already uncovered), (5,1) is 1 (uncovered), (6,1) is 0 (uncovered), (7,0) is '?' (unknown), (7,1) is 2 (uncovered). So (7,0) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nSimilarly, (6,1)=0: neighbors (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=?, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2. All neighbors are safe, so (7,0) is safe (already covered by (6,0)), (7,2) is 2 (uncovered).\n\n(6,2)=0: neighbors (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1. All neighbors are safe, so (7,3)=1 (uncovered).\n\n(6,3)=0: neighbors (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1. All safe.\n\n(6,4)=0: neighbors (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0. All safe.\n\n(6,5)=0: neighbors (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All safe.\n\nSo (7,0) is a safe cell that's currently '?', so we should uncover it. Let's check the current board: row 7 is [1,2,2,1,0,0,1,?,?], so column 0 is 1? Wait, the user's current board display might have a formatting issue. Let me re-express the current board correctly as 9x9:\n\nAssuming the current board is 9 rows, each with 9 columns, and the user's input has a line break error. Let's re-parse:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 0 0 1 F 2 1 1 ? ?\nRow 3: 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 7: 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 8: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ?\n\nYes, that makes sense (9 rows, 9 columns). So row 7, column 0 is 1 (already uncovered), row 7, column 1 is 2 (uncovered), etc. The '?' start from column 7 onwards in rows 2-7, and row 8 has '?' in columns 0-2 and 7-8.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 2 (4,2). It's '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell (4,2) is adjacent to:\n\n(3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1.\n\nLet's take (3,2)=2. The 2 at (3,2) has neighbors:\n\n(2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1.\n\nSince (2,3) is a mine, the 2 at (3,2) means there's 1 more mine in these 8 cells. The other cells are (2,1)=0 (safe), (2,2)=1 (safe, because (2,2)=1's neighbors include (2,3)=F, so (2,2) has only 1 mine which is (2,3)), (3,1)=1 (let's check (3,1)=1's neighbors: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (3,0)=0, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=? ). The 1 at (3,1) must have 1 mine. The possible mines here could be (3,2) or (4,2), but (3,2) is 2, which we know has (2,3) as a mine and needs one more. If (4,2) is a mine, then (3,2)=2 would have (2,3) and (4,2) as mines, which fits. But (3,1)=1 would then have (4,2) as the mine, which also fits. Alternatively, if (3,2) has a mine, but (3,2) is a number, so it can't be a mine. So (3,2) is a safe cell showing 2. So the mine for (3,2) must be in (4,2) or (3,3).\n\n(3,3)=2: neighbors are (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0. The 2 at (3,3) has (2,3) as a mine, so needs 1 more. (2,4)=2: neighbors (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=F, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. The 2 at (2,4) has (2,3) as a mine, so needs 1 more. (3,4)=1: neighbors (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. The 1 at (3,4) has (2,3) as a mine, so no other mines. So (3,4)=1 is safe, meaning (2,4)=2's other mine must be in (1,4) or (1,5) or (2,5). But (2,5)=1: neighbors (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. The 1 at (2,5) has 1 mine. Since (2,4)=2 has 1 mine (maybe (1,4)), (2,5)=1's mine could be (1,5) or (1,6).\n\nThis is getting too tangled. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 8, column 3 is 1 (row 8, column 3: 1). Its neighbors are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1, (9,2) invalid, (9,3) invalid, (9,4) invalid. So (8,3)=1's neighbors are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4). Since (7,3)=1 and (7,4)=1 are uncovered, and (7,2)=2 is uncovered, (8,2) and (8,4) are '?'. The 1 at (8,3) means there's 1 mine in these 5 cells. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we need to make moves that uncover safe cells. The safest moves are cells adjacent to 0s. Let's check row 6, column 6 (6,6)=1. Its neighbors are (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?. Since (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0 are safe, their neighbors are safe. (5,6)=1: neighbors (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. The 1 at (5,6) means 1 mine in its neighbors. Since (4,5), (5,5), (6,5) are 0, their adjacent cells are safe, so (4,6)=1, (6,6)=1 are safe, so the mine must be in (4,7) or (5,7) or (6,7).\n\nBut maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0 and is '?'. Let's check row 4, column 2 (4,2). Wait, row 4, column 2 is '?'. Let's see if it's safe. The cell (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1)=1. (4,1)=1 has neighbors (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=?, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. The 1 at (4,1) means 1 mine in these 8. The 0s at (3,0), (4,0), (5,0) are safe, so the mine must be in (3,1), (3,2), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2). (3,1)=1: which we already considered. (3,2)=2: has 1 mine (from (2,3)=F). (5,1)=1: has 1 mine. (5,2)=1: has 1 mine. This is too many possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 0 (8,0)=? (row 8, column 0 is '?'). Its neighbors are (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, (8,1)=?, (9,0) invalid, etc. Not helpful.\n\nWait, row 3, column 7 (3,7) is '?'. Let's check its neighbors. (3,7) is adjacent to (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=?. (2,6)=1: neighbors (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?. The 1 at (2,6) has 1 mine. (3,5)=0 is safe, so (2,5)=1 is safe. So the mine is in (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7). (3,6)=1: neighbors (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. The 1 at (3,6) has 1 mine. (3,5)=0 and (4,5)=0 are safe, so (2,5)=1 and (4,6)=1 are safe. So mine is in (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). But (2,6)=1 is a number, not a mine. So possible mines in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). \n\nThis is too uncertain. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in an area with known 0s. For example, row 6, column 7 (6,7) is '?'. Its neighbors are (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=?, (6,6)=1, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=?. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the flag. The user has 1 flag at (2,3), but there are 10 mines. The score is 1\/23, which is probably a mistake (should be 1\/10). So the user has flagged 1 mine correctly. To win, they need to flag all 10 or uncover all safe cells.\n\nAnother angle: the game ends if a mine is uncovered, so we need to avoid that. The safest cells are those adjacent to 0s. Let's check row 4, column 4 is 0, so (4,4)'s neighbors are all safe. (4,4) is (row 4, column 4)=0, so neighbors (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5) are all safe. (3,3)=2 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,5)=0 (safe), (5,3)=1 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=0 (safe). All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 5=0: neighbors (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. All safe and uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0=0: neighbors (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2. All safe, (7,0)=1 is uncovered, (7,1)=2 is uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 1=0: neighbors (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2. All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 2=0: neighbors (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1. All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 3=0: neighbors (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1. All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 4=0: neighbors (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0. All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5=0: neighbors (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All safe, uncovered.\n\nSo all the 0 cells' neighbors are already uncovered. Now, let's look for cells that have a known number of adjacent flags. For example, cell (2,3) is flagged (F), so we assume it's a mine. Let's check cell (2,4)=2. (2,4) has neighbors (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=F, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. The value 2 means 2 mines. We have 1 mine at (2,3), so there's 1 more mine here. The possible cells are (1,4), (1,5), (2,5), (3,3). (3,3)=2: which has (2,3) as a mine, so it needs 1 more mine. If (3,3)'s mine is (2,4)'s mine, then (2,4) and (3,3) both have their second mine as the same cell. For example, if (1,4) is a mine, then (2,4)=2 has (2,3) and (1,4), and (3,3)=2 has (2,3) and (1,4), which fits. So (1,4) could be a mine. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells with the number equal to the number of adjacent flags. For example, cell (2,2)=1. It has 1 adjacent flag (F at (2,3)), so that's correct. So (2,2)=1 is satisfied, meaning no other mines around it. So all other neighbors of (2,2) are safe. The neighbors of (2,2) are (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. We know (2,3) is the only mine, so (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are safe. That's a key point! So (1,3)=2 is safe, which means its 2 mines are elsewhere. (1,3)=2's neighbors are (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=1, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2. The 2 mines here are (2,3)=F and one more. Since (2,2)=1 is safe (only (2,3) is mine), (1,2)=1 is safe (only (2,3) is mine), (0,2)=0 is safe, (0,3)=1 is safe. So the other mine must be in (0,4) or (1,4) or (2,4). (2,4)=2: which has (2,3) as a mine, so needs 1 more. So (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) are possible for both (1,3)=2 and (2,4)=2. \n\nIf (1,4) is a mine, then (1,3)=2 has (2,3) and (1,4), and (2,4)=2 has (2,3) and (1,4), which works. So (1,4) is a possible mine. But we can't flag it yet without confirmation.\n\nBack to uncovering safe cells. Let's look at row 0, column 4 (0,4)=?. Its neighbors are (0,3)=1, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?. (0,3)=1: neighbors (0,2)=0, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?. The 1 at (0,3) means 1 mine in these 5 cells. (0,2)=0 and (1,2)=1 are safe, so the mine is in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4). (1,3)=2 is safe (it's a number), so the mine is in (0,4) or (1,4). If (0,4) is safe, then (1,4) is a mine. But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7, column 7 (7,7)=?. Its neighbors are (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=1, (7,8)=?, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?, (8,8)=?. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in a region with the most known information. Let's look at row 4, column 2 (4,2)=?. Earlier, we saw that (3,2)=2 has (2,3)=F as a mine, so needs 1 more. (3,2) is at (3,2), neighbors include (4,2). If (4,2) is safe, then (3,2)'s mine must be in (3,3). (3,3)=2 has (2,3)=F as a mine, so needs 1 more. If (3,3)'s mine is (2,4), then (2,4)=2 has (2,3)=F and (2,4) as mines, which fits. But this is all speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the user has a low score (1\/10 correct flags), so they need to flag more mines. But without clear mine locations, it's risky to flag. So better to uncover safe cells.\n\nLooking at the current board, the '?' cells are mostly in the right half (columns 7-8) of rows 2-7, and the top-left (row 8, columns 0-2). Let's check row 8, column 3=1. Its neighbors are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. (7,3)=1: neighbors (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. The 1 at (7,3) has 1 mine. (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) are 0s, so safe. (7,2)=2, (7,4)=1, (8,2), (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1 are safe. So the mine must be in (7,3) is a number, so no. Wait, (7,3)=1 is a number, so it's safe. Its value is 1, meaning 1 mine in its neighbors. The neighbors are (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. So 1 mine in these 8. The 0s are safe, so mine is in (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (7,2)=2: neighbors (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1. The 2 at (7,2) has 2 mines. (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) are 0s, so safe. (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1), (8,2), (8,3)=1. So 2 mines here. This is too complex.\n\nMaybe the safest move is to uncover a cell in the right half where there are 0s nearby. For example, row 3, column 7 (3,7)=?. Its neighbor (3,6)=1, which has 1 mine. (3,6) is at (3,6), neighbors (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. (3,5)=0 and (4,5)=0 are safe, so (2,5)=1 and (4,6)=1 are safe. So the mine in (3,6) is in (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). (2,6)=1: neighbors (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?. (2,6)=1 has 1 mine. (2,5)=1 and (3,5)=0 are safe, so mine is in (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7). So (3,7) could be safe if the mine is elsewhere. Since we can't be sure, but need to make a move, maybe uncover (3,7).\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 7 (2,7)=?. Its neighbor (2,6)=1, which has 1 mine. (2,6) has neighbors (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?. (3,5)=0 is safe, (2,5)=1 is safe, (3,6)=1 is safe. So mine is in (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,7), (3,7). If we uncover (2,7) and it's a number, we can get more info.\n\nBut maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Wait, row 3, column 5=0, so (3,5) has neighbors (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All uncovered. So no help.\n\nAnother idea: the cell (4,2) is '?', and its adjacent cell (4,1)=1. (4,1) has 1 mine in its neighbors. If (4,2) is safe, then (4,1)'s mine must be in (5,2). (5,2)=1: neighbors (4,1)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0. (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) are 0s, so safe. So (5,2)=1 has 1 mine in (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3). (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,3)=1 are all numbers, so they are safe. Therefore, the mine in (5,2)=1 must be (4,2). Oh! That's a key insight.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n(5,2) is 1. Its neighbors are:\n\n(4,1)=1 (safe, as it's a number),\n\n(4,2)=? (unknown),\n\n(4,3)=1 (safe),\n\n(5,1)=1 (safe),\n\n(5,3)=1 (safe),\n\n(6,1)=0 (safe),\n\n(6,2)=0 (safe),\n\n(6,3)=0 (safe).\n\nThe value 1 at (5,2) means there's exactly 1 mine in these 8 neighbors. All the neighbors except (4,2) are either numbers (safe) or 0s (safe). Therefore, the only possible mine is (4,2). So (4,2) must be a mine!\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let's confirm:\n\n(5,2) has 8 neighbors. 5 of them are numbers (1s), which are safe (since they are uncovered and show the count, so they can't be mines). 3 of them are 0s (safe). The only unknown is (4,2). Since (5,2)=1, there must be 1 mine in its neighbors. All other neighbors are safe, so (4,2) must be the mine. Therefore, (4,2) is a mine and should be flagged.\n\nBut wait, the user's action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. Since (4,2) is a mine, we should flag it. Let's check:\n\nCurrent flags: 1 (at (2,3)). If (4,2) is a mine, flagging it would increase the correct flags to 2.\n\nBut let's confirm again:\n\n(5,2) is 1. Its neighbors:\n\n(4,1): 1 (safe, because it's a number, not a mine),\n\n(4,2): ?,\n\n(4,3): 1 (safe),\n\n(5,1): 1 (safe),\n\n(5,3): 1 (safe),\n\n(6,1): 0 (safe),\n\n(6,2): 0 (safe),\n\n(6,3): 0 (safe).\n\nThe 1 at (5,2) indicates 1 mine in these 8. All the safe cells (numbers and 0s) can't be mines, so the only possible mine is (4,2). Therefore, (4,2) is a mine. So we should flag (4,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (4,2)","flag (4,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's understand the current board. The user provided a 15x15 grid, but Minesweeper is typically 9x9. Maybe there's a formatting error, but I'll focus on the visible part. The board shows rows 0 to 8, with some cells uncovered, flagged (F), or unknown (?).\n\nThe score is 0.08695652173913043, which is 2\/23, meaning 2 correct flags out of 23 total flags placed. The game has 10 mines, so 2 correct and 21 incorrect flags. The user wants to maximize the score, so we need to flag the actual mines and unflag the wrong ones.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's list the known cells:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (First 4 cells uncovered, 0,0,0,1)\nRow 1: 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (First 4 cells: 0,0,1,2)\nRow 2: 0 0 1 F 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Cell (2,3) is F; adjacent cells: (2,2)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1)\nRow 3: 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Cells (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1)\nRow 4: 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Cell (4,2)=F; adjacent cells: (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1)\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Cells (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Cells (6,0)=0 to (6,6)=1)\nRow 7: 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

There are two F's: (2,3) and (4,2). Let's verify each.\n\nFor (2,3) (row 2, column 3): Let's look at adjacent cells. The cell (2,2) is 1, which is the number of mines in its 8 neighbors. (2,2) is at (2,2), so its neighbors are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2) shows 1, so there should be 1 mine in those cells. Let's list known cells in those neighbors:\n\n(1,1) is 0 (row 1, column 1), (1,2) is 1 (row 1, column 2), (1,3) is 2 (row 1, column 3), (2,1) is 0 (row 2, column 1), (2,3) is F (flagged), (3,1) is 1 (row 3, column 1), (3,2) is 2 (row 3, column 2), (3,3) is 2 (row 3, column 3). None of these are uncovered mines (since the game hasn't ended), so the mine count for (2,2) is 1. If (2,3) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine, which fits. So (2,3) might be a correct flag.\n\nNow (4,2) (row 4, column 2). Let's check adjacent cell (4,1)=1. (4,1)'s neighbors are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (4,1) shows 1, so 1 mine in these cells. Known cells: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=F, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. None are uncovered mines. So if (4,2) is a mine, that's the 1 mine, which fits. So (4,2) might also be correct. But the score is 2\/23, so 2 correct, 21 incorrect. So there are 21 F's that are wrong.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The goal is to uncover all safe cells to win. Let's find cells that are '?' and have adjacent numbers that can be determined to be safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So the cells around (3,5) (row 3, column 5) should be safe. (3,5) is at (3,5), so neighbors are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Let's check which of these are '?'.\n\n(2,4) is 2 (row 2, column 4), (2,5) is 1 (row 2, column 5), (2,6) is 1 (row 2, column 6), (3,4) is 1 (row 3, column 4), (3,6) is 1 (row 3, column 6), (4,4) is 0 (row 4, column 4), (4,5) is 0 (row 4, column 5), (4,6) is 1 (row 4, column 6). All these are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nNext, row 4, column 4 and 5 are 0. (4,4) is 0, neighbors are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4 and 5 are 0. (5,4)=0, neighbors: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, columns 0-5 are 0. (6,0)=0, neighbors: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 4 and 5 are 0. (7,4)=0, neighbors: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) are 1, so their neighbors might have mines, but (7,4)=0 means those 8 cells are safe. So (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) are safe? Wait, (7,4)=0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) are adjacent to (7,4) and are safe. So those cells can be uncovered.\n\nLet's check (8,3): row 8, column 3. It's currently '?'. Since (7,4)=0, (8,3) is adjacent to (7,4) (row 7, column 4) is (7,4) is (row=7, col=4). The neighbors of (7,4) are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). All these must be safe (no mines) because (7,4)=0. So (8,3), (8,4), (8,5) are safe. Therefore, uncovering these would be safe.\n\nLet's pick one of them. Let's choose (8,3). Wait, the current row 8 is shown as \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so (8,3) is 1, (8,4) is 1, (8,5) is 1, (8,6) is 1. Oh, right, the user's board shows row 8 as \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so (8,3) is already 1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. So those are uncovered. So maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 6 is 1. (3,6) has neighbors: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. The rest (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) are '?'. (3,6)=1, so there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. Since (2,5)=1 and (2,6)=1 are already uncovered (they are numbers), they are safe. So the mine count is 1 in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nSimilarly, row 4, column 6 is 1. (4,6) neighbors: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. So the mine count here is 1, which could be in (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 1. (5,6) neighbors: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. So mine count 1 in (4,7), (5,7), (6,7).\n\nRow 6, column 6 is 1. (6,6) neighbors: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. So mine count 1 in (5,7), (6,7), (7,7).\n\nRow 7, column 6 is 1. (7,6) neighbors: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. So mine count 1 in (6,7), (7,7), (8,7).\n\nRow 8, column 6 is 1. (8,6) neighbors: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,5)=1, (9,5) is '?', etc. So mine count 1 here.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe look for cells that are definitely safe. Let's check row 0, column 4 (0,4). It's '?'. The adjacent cells to (0,4) are (0,3)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)='?', (0,5)='?', etc. (0,3)=1 has 8 neighbors: (0,2)=0, (0,4), (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4), (0,1)=0, (0,3) itself, (1,1)=0. Wait, (0,3) is 1, so the number of mines in its 8 neighbors is 1. The neighbors of (0,3) are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (0,1), (0,3) is the cell itself, no, wait, the 8 adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), excluding the cell itself. So (0,3) neighbors are ( -1,2) invalid, (-1,3) invalid, (-1,4) invalid, (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So valid cells: (0,2)=0, (0,4)='?', (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)='?'. (0,3)=1 means there's 1 mine among these 5 cells (since the others are out of bounds). (0,2)=0 is safe, (1,2)=1 is a number (safe), (1,3)=2 is a number (safe). So the mine must be in either (0,4) or (1,4). So (0,4) and (1,4) have 1 mine between them.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3)=2: its neighbors are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2. So (1,3)=2 has 8 neighbors. Let's list them:\n\n(0,2)=0 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (0,4)='?', (1,2)=1 (safe), (1,4)='?', (2,2)=1 (safe), (2,3)=F (flagged, possibly mine), (2,4)=2 (safe). So the number of mines here is 2. Known possible mines: (2,3) is F (maybe mine), and (0,4)\/(1,4) as above. If (2,3) is a mine (correct flag), then that's 1 mine, so there must be 1 more mine in (0,4) or (1,4). That fits with (0,3)=1. So (0,4) and (1,4) have 1 mine, and (2,3) is a mine.\n\nNow, (2,4)=2: its neighbors are (1,3)=2, (1,4)='?', (1,5)='?', (2,3)=F, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (2,4)=2 means 2 mines in these 8 cells. (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,3)=F (maybe mine), (2,5)=1 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe). So possible mines: (1,4), (1,5). If (2,3) is a mine, that's 1, so (1,4) or (1,5) has 1 mine. (1,4) is already a candidate from (0,3) and (1,3). So (1,4) could be the mine, then (1,5) is safe. Or (1,5) is the mine, (1,4) is safe.\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe look for a cell that's definitely safe. Let's check row 0, column 0 to 3 are all 0 or 1, which are safe. The first '?' in row 0 is (0,4). Let's see if there's a 0 cell that can reveal adjacent safe cells. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0: its neighbors are (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, all safe. So no new info.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 0: neighbors (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, all safe.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is 0: neighbors (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, all safe.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is 0: neighbors (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, all safe.\n\nRow 4, column 0 is 0: neighbors (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, all safe.\n\nRow 5, column 0 is 0: neighbors (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, all safe.\n\nRow 6, column 0 is 0: neighbors (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, all safe.\n\nRow 7, column 0 is 1: neighbors (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=2, (8,0)='?', (8,1)='?', (8,2)='?', (6,2)=0 (row 6, column 2 is 0), (7,2)=2 (row 7, column 2 is 2). So (7,0)=1 means 1 mine in those 8 cells. Known safe cells: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2. So possible mines in (8,0), (8,1), (8,2).\n\nRow 7, column 1 is 2: neighbors (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2, (8,0)='?', (8,1)='?', (8,2)='?'. (7,1)=2 means 2 mines in these 8 cells. Since (7,0)=1 has 1 mine in (8,0),(8,1),(8,2), (7,1)=2 would have 2 mines there, which is possible.\n\nRow 7, column 2 is 2: neighbors (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)='?', (8,2)='?', (8,3)=1. (7,2)=2 means 2 mines in those 8 cells. (6,1-3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,3)=1 are safe, so mines in (8,1), (8,2).\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which guarantees it's safe. Let's check where there's a 0 with adjacent '?'.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is 0. Its neighbors are (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 4 and 5 are 0. Their neighbors are all uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4 and 5 are 0. Neighbors are all uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0-5 are 0. Their neighbors are mostly uncovered. The only '?' nearby might be in row 6, column 7, but that's further.\n\nRow 7, column 4 and 5 are 0. Their neighbors include (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, which are uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 3-6 are 1s. Their neighbors might have mines, but they are already uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we need to make moves to uncover safe cells or correct flags. Since there are 23 flags, 21 are incorrect, so unflagging them would help, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet. However, the problem is to output an action, which could be uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nBut the user's score is 2\/23, meaning 2 correct flags. Since there are 10 mines, we need to flag the remaining 8. But we need to find where the mines are.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's definitely a mine. For example, let's take (2,3) is F, which we thought might be correct. (4,2) is F, also possibly correct. Let's check another cell.\n\nTake (3,3)=2. Its neighbors are (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0. (3,3)=2 means 2 mines in these 8 cells. Known F's: (2,3) and (4,2). If both are mines, that's 2, which matches (3,3)=2. So that's a good sign. So (2,3) and (4,2) are correct flags (since (3,3)=2 has exactly 2 mines, which are the two F's). That would mean the score is 2\/23 (since 2 correct, 21 incorrect). So those two are correct.\n\nNow, let's check (4,3)=1. Its neighbors are (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0. (4,3)=1 means 1 mine in these 8 cells. (4,2)=F is a mine (correct), so that's the 1 mine. Perfect, that fits. So (4,2) is indeed a mine.\n\nSimilarly, (2,2)=1: neighbors are (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. (2,2)=1 means 1 mine, which is (2,3)=F. Correct.\n\nSo (2,3) and (4,2) are correct mines. Now, we need to find the other 8 mines.\n\nLet's look at (2,4)=2. Its neighbors are (1,3)=2, (1,4)='?', (1,5)='?', (2,3)=F (mine), (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (2,4)=2 means 2 mines. We have 1 mine at (2,3), so there's 1 more mine in (1,4) or (1,5).\n\n(1,3)=2: neighbors are (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)='?', (1,2)=1, (1,4)='?', (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,4)=2. (1,3)=2 means 2 mines. We have 1 mine at (2,3), so 1 more mine in (0,4) or (1,4). Which matches (2,4)=2's need for 1 mine in (1,4)\/(1,5). So if (1,4) is a mine, then (0,4) and (1,5) are safe. If (0,4) is a mine, then (1,4) is safe, and (1,5) must be a mine to satisfy (2,4)=2. Let's see:\n\nIf (0,4) is a mine: then (1,3)=2 has mines at (2,3) and (0,4), which is 2. Good. Then (2,4)=2 needs 2 mines: (2,3) and (1,5). So (1,5) would be a mine. Then (1,4) is safe.\n\nIf (1,4) is a mine: then (1,3)=2 has mines at (2,3) and (1,4), which is 2. Good. Then (2,4)=2 has mines at (2,3) and (1,4), which is 2. Good. Then (0,4) and (1,5) are safe.\n\nWhich is more likely? Let's check (0,3)=1: neighbors are (0,2)=0, (0,4)='?', (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)='?'. (0,3)=1 means 1 mine in these. If (0,4) is a mine, that's 1. If (1,4) is a mine, that's 1. So either is possible.\n\nLet's check (1,2)=1: neighbors are (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine). (1,2)=1 means 1 mine. (2,3) is a mine, so that's 1. Perfect, so (1,2)=1 is satisfied by (2,3).\n\nNow, let's look at (3,2)=2: neighbors are (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=F (mine), (4,3)=1. (3,2)=2 means 2 mines. We have (2,3) and (4,2) as mines, which is 2. Perfect, that fits. So (3,2)=2 is satisfied by those two mines. Great, so (2,3) and (4,2) are confirmed mines.\n\nNow, (4,1)=1: neighbors are (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=F (mine), (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. (4,1)=1 means 1 mine, which is (4,2). Correct.\n\n(5,2)=1: neighbors are (4,1)=1, (4,2)=F (mine), (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,3)=1, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0. (5,2)=1 means 1 mine, which is (4,2). Correct.\n\n(5,3)=1: neighbors are (4,2)=F (mine), (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0. (5,3)=1 means 1 mine, which is (4,2). Correct.\n\nSo all these cells are satisfied by (2,3) and (4,2) being mines. Now, we need to find the other 8 mines.\n\nLet's look at (2,5)=1: neighbors are (1,4)='?', (1,5)='?', (1,6)='?', (2,4)=2, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1. (2,5)=1 means 1 mine in these 8 cells. (2,4)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1 are safe. So possible mines in (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,6). (2,6)=1: neighbors are (1,5)='?', (1,6)='?', (1,7)='?', (2,5)=1, (2,7)='?', (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)='?'. (2,6)=1 means 1 mine in those 8 cells. So (2,5)=1 and (2,6)=1 each need 1 mine, possibly overlapping.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Since the goal is to uncover a safe cell, let's find a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe. Let's check row 6, column 5 is 0. Its neighbors are (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0: neighbors are (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 1: neighbors are (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=1, (9,3)='?', (9,4)='?', (9,5)='?'. (8,4)=1 means 1 mine in these. (7,4)=0 and (7,5)=0 are safe, so mines in (7,3)=1 (safe), (8,3)=1 (safe), (8,5)=1 (safe), so the mine is in (9,3), (9,4), (9,5).\n\nBut maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in the known safe area. For example, row 0, column 4 is '?', but we're not sure if it's a mine. Alternatively, look at row 8, column 0: '?'. Since row 7, column 0 is 1, which has 1 mine in its neighbors, which include (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). If we uncover (8,0) and it's a number, we can get info. But it's risky.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's adjacent to multiple 0s. For example, row 6, column 7: '?'. Its neighbor (6,6)=1, (6,5)=0, so (6,5)=0 means (6,7) is safe? No, (6,5)=0's neighbors are (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (6,7) is not adjacent to (6,5).\n\nWait, row 3, column 5 is 0, which is a \"blank\" cell, so all adjacent cells are safe. We already checked those. Maybe row 0, column 4 is adjacent to (0,3)=1, which has 1 mine. If we uncover (0,4) and it's a number, we can get info. But if it's a mine, the game ends. Since the user's score is 2\/23, maybe they need to uncover more cells to win by uncovering all safe cells.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the right side of the board. Most of the '?' are in columns 7-14 of each row. Let's pick a cell in column 7, row 2: (2,7). It's '?'. Its neighbors are (1,6)='?', (1,7)='?', (1,8)='?', (2,6)=1, (2,8)='?', (3,6)=1, (3,7)='?', (3,8)='?'. (2,6)=1 has 1 mine in its neighbors, which include (2,7). If (2,7) is safe, uncovering it might show a number.\n\nBut without more info, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in the early rows where more info is available. Let's pick (0,4). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since (3,5) is 0, all adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered. Maybe (1,4) is a good candidate. Let's say we uncover (1,4). If it's a number, we can get info. If it's a mine, the game ends, but the user's score is low anyway.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the initial rows. Row 0, columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,1. The first '?' is (0,4). Let's uncover (0,4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,4)","uncover (0,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current board. The user provided a 15x15 grid, but Minesweeper is usually 9x9, so maybe there's a formatting issue. Wait, the initial problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so perhaps the board is displayed with each row separated by a line, and maybe each row has 9 cells. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines: Each line has 9 cells separated by spaces? Let's count. The first line: \"0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? ?\" – that's 9 cells. Yes, 9 elements per row. So rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nThe board rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 0 0 1 F 2 1 1 ? ?\nRow 3: 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 7: 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 8: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ?\n\nWait, each row has 9 cells. So the coordinates are (row, col) where row and col are 0-8.\n\nNow, the task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The current score is 0.08695652173913043, which is 2\/23 (since 2\/23 ≈ 0.087). So there are 23 flags placed, but only 2 are correct (since total mines are 10). The user has flagged 23 cells, 2 correct, 21 incorrect. So they need to unflag those, but the unflags count is 0, so maybe the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the problem is to make a move now.\n\nFirst, let's look for safe cells to uncover. Uncovering a safe cell helps reveal more information. Let's check the known cells (non-? and non-F) to find cells that have adjacent ? that must be safe.\n\nLet's go through each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,0,1,1,?, ?, ?, ?]\n- The 0s in (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) mean all adjacent cells are safe. Their adjacent cells are (0,0) adjacent: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) – all 0s already. (0,1) adjacent: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) – 0s and 0s. (0,2) adjacent: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,3) is 1. So (0,2) is 0, so (1,3) (which is row 1, column 3) is 2. Let's check row 1, column 3: row 1 is [0,0,1,2,?,?,?,?,?], so (1,3) is 2. That's okay.\n\nRow 0, column 4 is 1. So adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3) is 1 (which is a number, not a mine), (1,3) is 2. So (0,4)=1: the number of mines in its 8 neighbors. The neighbors are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3) is 1 (not a mine), (1,3) is 2 (not a mine). So the mine count here is 1. So among (0,5), (1,4), (1,5), there's 1 mine.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,2,?,?,?,?,?]\nRow 1, column 0: 0, so adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) are all 0s. Safe.\n\nRow 1, column 1: 0, same as above.\n\nRow 1, column 2: 1. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (flagged). So the 1 in (1,2) should have 1 mine in adjacent cells. The F at (2,3) is a flagged cell. So if (2,3) is a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So that's a possible correct flag. But the user's flags are 2\/23, so maybe (2,3) is one of the correct ones.\n\nRow 1, column 3: 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=1, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2. So the 2 here: the number of mines in adjacent cells. Let's count possible mines: (1,4), (2,4) is 2 (number, not mine). (0,4)=1 (number). So (1,4) and (2,3) (F). If (2,3) is a mine (correct flag), then (1,4) could be a mine (since 2 mines: 1 from F, 1 from (1,4)), but (2,4) is 2, which is a number, so not a mine. Let's check (2,4)=2. Its adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,3)=2, (2,3)=F, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. So (2,4)=2: the number of mines in adjacent cells. If (2,3) is a mine (F), then (1,4) and (2,5) could be mines. But (3,5)=0, which is a number, so (3,5) has 0 adjacent mines, meaning all 8 neighbors of (3,5) are safe. (3,5) is (row 3, column 5) which is 0. Let's check (3,5)=0. Its adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (3,4)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. (3,5)=0 means none of these adjacent cells are mines. So (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) are all safe. Because (3,5)=0, so all 8 neighbors are safe. So (2,5) is a neighbor of (3,5), so (2,5) is safe. That's a key point. So (2,5) is safe (since (3,5)=0). Therefore, (2,4)=2: adjacent mines. (2,3) is F (mine), (2,5) is safe. So the other mine must be in (1,4) or (3,4). (3,4)=1, which is a number, not a mine. (1,4) is a ?. So (1,4) must be a mine? Wait, (2,4)=2. Its adjacent cells: (1,3)=2 (number), (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,5)=safe (from (3,5)=0), (3,3)=2 (number), (3,4)=1 (number), (3,5)=0 (number). So the mines in (2,4)'s neighbors are (2,3) (F) and (1,4). So (1,4) must be a mine. Because (2,4) has 2 mines, and (2,3) is one, so (1,4) is the other. Therefore, (1,4) is a mine. So maybe we should flag (1,4). But let's check other cells.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is 0. As mentioned, (3,5)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. Let's list them:\n\n(3,5) neighbors: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\n(2,4)=2 (number, not mine), (2,5)=? (but safe), (2,6)=? (safe), (3,4)=1 (number), (3,6)=? (safe), (4,4)=0 (number), (4,5)=0 (number), (4,6)=1 (number). So all these cells are safe. Therefore, (2,5), (2,6), (3,6), (4,5), (4,6) are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nFor example, (4,5) is 0 (row 4, column 5: row 4 is [0,1,F,1,0,0,1,?,?], so (4,5) is 0. That's already a 0, so its adjacent cells are all safe. So (4,5)=0, so (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) are all safe. (5,5) is 0 (row 5: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,?,?], (5,5) is 0). So (5,5)=0, so its neighbors are safe. (5,5) neighbors: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). All of these are numbers, so safe. So (6,5) is 0 (row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?], (6,5) is 0). (6,5)=0, so (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are safe. (7,5)=0 (row 7: [1,2,2,1,0,0,1,?,?], (7,5) is 0). So (7,5)=0, neighbors are safe. (7,5) neighbors: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (8,4)=1 (row 8: [?,?,?,1,1,1,1,?,?], (8,4) is 1). So (8,4)=1: adjacent mines. Let's check (8,4)=1. Its neighbors are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) – but wait, the grid is 9x9, so row 8 is the last row (0-8). So (8,4) neighbors are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (since 9 is beyond the grid). (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3: 1), (7,4)=0 (row 7, column 4: 0), (7,5)=0 (row 7, column 5: 0), (8,3)=1 (row 8, column 3: 1), (8,5)=1 (row 8, column 5: 1). So (8,4)=1: the number of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (7,3)=1 (number), (7,4)=0 (number), (7,5)=0 (number), (8,3)=1 (number), (8,5)=1 (number), and the cells below (but row 8 is the last, so no row 9). So maybe (8,4)=1 has no adjacent mines, but that's conflicting. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in row indices. Let's confirm the grid is 9x9, rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So row 8 is the last row, column 8 is the last column.\n\nLet's focus on the cells that are 0, because 0 means all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. For example, (3,5)=0. Its adjacent cell (2,5) is ?, so we can uncover (2,5) safely. Similarly, (2,6) is adjacent to (3,5)=0, so (2,6) is safe. Let's check (3,5)=0:\n\n(3,5) is in row 3, column 5. Its adjacent cells are:\n\nrow 2, column 4: (2,4)=2 (number)\nrow 2, column 5: (2,5)=? (safe)\nrow 2, column 6: (2,6)=? (safe)\nrow 3, column 4: (3,4)=1 (number)\nrow 3, column 6: (3,6)=? (safe)\nrow 4, column 4: (4,4)=0 (number)\nrow 4, column 5: (4,5)=0 (number)\nrow 4, column 6: (4,6)=1 (number)\n\nSo (2,5), (2,6), (3,6) are all adjacent to a 0 cell, so they are safe. Therefore, uncovering these cells is safe.\n\nLet's pick one of these. For example, (2,5) is in row 2, column 5. The current cell (2,5) is ?, so uncovering it would be safe. Alternatively, (3,6) is also safe. Let's check (3,6). (3,6) is in row 3, column 6. Its adjacent cells include (3,5)=0, so (3,6) is safe. So uncovering (3,6) is safe.\n\nAnother 0 cell is (4,5) (row 4, column 5). Its adjacent cells:\n\nrow 3, column 4: 1 (number)\nrow 3, column 5: 0 (number)\nrow 3, column 6: ? (safe)\nrow 4, column 4: 0 (number)\nrow 4, column 6: 1 (number)\nrow 5, column 4: 0 (number)\nrow 5, column 5: 0 (number)\nrow 5, column 6: 1 (number)\n\nSo (3,6) is adjacent to (4,5)=0, so (3,6) is safe. So (3,6) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's check (3,6) in the current board. Row 3 is [0,1,2,2,1,0,1,?,?]. So column 6 is 1. Wait, row 3: \"0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ?\" – so (3,6) is 1, not ?. Oh, right! So row 3, columns 0-8: [0 (0,0), 1 (0,1), 2 (0,2), 2 (0,3), 1 (0,4), 0 (0,5), 1 (0,6), ? (0,7), ? (0,8)]. So (3,6) is 1, which is a number. So (3,6) is already uncovered. Then (3,7) and (3,8) are ?. Let's check (3,5)=0's adjacent cells again. (3,5)=0's neighbors include (3,6)=1 (number), (2,6)=? (row 2, column 6: row 2 is [0,0,1,F,2,1,1,?,?], so (2,6)=1. Oh, right! Row 2: \"0 0 1 F 2 1 1 ? ?\" – so (2,6) is 1. So (2,6) is 1, already uncovered. Then (2,7) and (2,8) are ?.\n\n(3,5)=0's adjacent cells: (2,5) is row 2, column 5: row 2 is [0,0,1,F,2,1,1,?,?], so (2,5)=1. Oh! I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-express the rows correctly with 9 columns each:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?] → columns 0-8: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (0,5)=?, (0,6)=?, (0,7)=?, (0,8)=?\nRow 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] → (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?] → (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?\nRow 3: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?\nRow 4: [0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=?\nRow 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=?\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (6,8)=?\nRow 7: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] → (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=?\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?] → (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?, (8,8)=?\n\nOkay, that's the correct 9x9 grid. Now, let's re-analyze.\n\nLooking for 0 cells, which indicate all adjacent cells are safe. Let's list 0 cells:\n\n- (0,0), (0,1), (0,2): all 0s. Their adjacent cells are already uncovered (since (0,0) adjacent: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are 0s; (0,1) adjacent: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are 0s, 0, 1; (0,2) adjacent: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) → (0,3)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2. So these 0s don't have ? adjacent.\n\n- (1,0), (1,1): 0s. (1,0) adjacent: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1) → all 0s. (1,1) adjacent: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) → (0,2)=0, (1,2)=1, (2,2)=1. So no ? adjacent here.\n\n- (2,0), (2,1): 0s. (2,0) adjacent: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1) → (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1. (2,1) adjacent: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) → (1,2)=1, (2,2)=1, (3,2)=2. No ? adjacent.\n\n- (3,0): 0. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) → (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1. No ?.\n\n- (4,0): 0. Adjacent: (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1) → (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1. No ?.\n\n- (5,0): 0. Adjacent: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1) → (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=1, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0. No ?.\n\n- (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5): all 0s. Let's check (6,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All these are numbers, so no ? adjacent.\n\n- (7,4), (7,5): 0s. (7,4)=0 adjacent: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. No ?.\n\n- (4,4), (4,5): 0s. (4,4)=0 adjacent: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All numbers.\n\n- (5,4), (5,5): 0s. Same as above, adjacent cells are numbers.\n\n- (3,5): 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All numbers.\n\nSo all 0 cells have their adjacent cells already uncovered (numbers) or flagged. Now, let's look for cells with numbers that have adjacent ? cells where we can determine if they're safe or mines.\n\nLet's take row 4, column 2: (4,2)=F (flagged). The user has 23 flags, 2 correct. So this flag is likely incorrect. Let's check the number that (4,2) is adjacent to. (4,2) is in row 4, column 2. Adjacent cells: (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\n(3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1.\n\nThe number (3,2)=2: adjacent cells. (3,2)=2 has neighbors: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1. So (3,2)=2: number of mines in adjacent cells. The Fs are (2,3) and (4,2). If both are mines, that's 2 mines, which matches (3,2)=2. So (2,3) and (4,2) could be correct flags. Since the user's correct flags are 2, maybe these are the two. So (2,3) and (4,2) are correct mines. That would make sense. So (2,3)=F and (4,2)=F are the two correct flags. Then the other 21 flags are incorrect.\n\nNow, let's look at row 2, column 3: (2,3)=F. Let's check (2,2)=1. (2,2)=1 has adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. So (2,2)=1: the number of mines in adjacent cells. If (2,3)=F is a mine, then that's 1 mine, which matches (2,2)=1. So that's correct. So (2,3)=F is a correct flag.\n\nRow 4, column 2: (4,2)=F. Check (4,1)=1. (4,1)=1 has adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=F, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. So (4,1)=1: number of mines in adjacent cells. If (4,2)=F is a mine, that's 1 mine, which matches (4,1)=1. So (4,2)=F is a correct flag. That makes 2 correct flags, which matches the user's score (2\/23). So these two flags are correct, others are wrong.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be uncovered safely. Let's check row 0, column 5: (0,5)=?. What's adjacent to it? (0,5) is in row 0, column 5. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4)=1, (0,6)=?, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?.\n\n(0,4)=1: adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3)=1, (1,3)=2. So (0,4)=1: number of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,5), (1,4), (1,5). So there's 1 mine among these three.\n\nRow 1, column 3: (1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=1, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,4)=2. So (1,3)=2: number of mines in adjacent cells. We know (2,3)=F is a mine (1 mine). So there's 1 more mine in (1,4), (0,4), (0,3), (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (2,4). But (0,2)=0 (no mine), (0,3)=1 (number, not mine), (0,4)=1 (number, not mine), (1,2)=1 (number, not mine), (2,2)=1 (number, not mine), (2,4)=2 (number, not mine). So the remaining mine must be (1,4). So (1,4)=?. Therefore, (1,4) is a mine. So we should flag (1,4). But wait, the user has 23 flags, which are mostly incorrect. But maybe (1,4) is a mine. Let's confirm.\n\n(2,4)=2: adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,3)=2, (2,3)=F (mine), (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. So (2,4)=2: mines in adjacent cells. We have (2,3)=F (mine), so there's 1 more mine. (1,4) is adjacent to (2,4), so if (1,4) is a mine, that's 2 mines, which matches (2,4)=2. Also, (1,3)=2 has 2 mines: (2,3) and (1,4). That fits. So (1,4) is a mine. So we should flag (1,4). But the user has 23 flags, which are mostly wrong. However, the user's current flags are 2\/23, so adding a correct flag would improve the score.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other cells. Let's look at row 7, column 0: (7,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=2, (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?. So (7,0)=1: number of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (8,0) and (8,1), since (6,0) and (6,1) are 0 (no mines), (7,1)=2 (number, not mine). So there's 1 mine between (8,0) and (8,1).\n\nRow 7, column 1: (7,1)=2. Adjacent cells: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2, (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?. So (7,1)=2: number of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells with ? are (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). From (7,0)=1, there's 1 mine in (8,0) or (8,1). So (7,1)=2 has 2 mines in (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Since (7,0)=1 has 1 mine in (8,0)\/(8,1), then (8,2) must be a mine to make (7,1)=2 have 2 mines. So (8,2) is a mine. So we should flag (8,2).\n\nBut let's verify. (7,2)=2: adjacent cells are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1. So (7,2)=2: number of mines in adjacent cells. (7,3)=1 (number, not mine), (8,3)=1 (number, not mine). So the mines are in (8,1), (8,2). If (8,2) is a mine (from (7,1)=2), then (8,1) could be a mine or not. But (7,2)=2 needs 2 mines. If (8,2) is a mine, then (8,1) could be a mine. But (7,1)=2 would have 2 mines: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). If (8,2) is a mine, then (8,0) or (8,1) has 1 mine (from (7,0)=1). So (7,1)=2 would have 1 (from (7,0)) + 1 (from (8,2)) = 2 mines. That fits. So (8,2) is a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for safe cells to uncover. Let's check row 8, column 3: (8,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) – but row 8 is the last row, so (9,2) etc. don't exist. So (8,3)=1's adjacent cells are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. (7,4)=0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so (8,4) is adjacent to (7,4)=0. (7,4)=0's adjacent cells include (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). So (8,4), (8,5) are safe because (7,4)=0. So (8,4) and (8,5) can be uncovered safely.\n\n(8,4)=1: adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (8,6). (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. All these are numbers, so (8,4) is 1, which is safe (since it's a number, not a mine). So (8,4) is already uncovered? No, (8,4) is 1 in the current board, which is a number, so it's uncovered. (8,5)=1: same, uncovered. (8,6)=1: uncovered.\n\nNow, let's check row 0, column 5: (0,5)=?. Adjacent to (0,4)=1, which has 1 mine in (0,5), (1,4), (1,5). If (1,4) is a mine (as per earlier analysis), then (0,5) and (1,5) are safe. Because (0,4)=1 has 1 mine, which is (1,4). So (0,5) and (1,5) are safe. Therefore, (0,5) can be uncovered safely.\n\nYes! Let's confirm. (0,4)=1: adjacent cells are (0,3)=1, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?. The number of mines here is 1. We determined that (1,4) is a mine (from (1,3)=2 and (2,4)=2), so that's the 1 mine. Therefore, (0,5) and (1,5) are safe. So uncovering (0,5) is safe.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover (0,5), which is a safe cell.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,5)","uncover (0,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The board shown is 15x15, but the actual game is 9x9, so maybe the user pasted it wrong? Wait, the problem statement says the board is 9x9, so maybe the current board is a 9x9 grid, and the way it's displayed here is split into lines. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines: each line has 15 characters, but 9x9 should have 9 rows each with 9 cells. Oh, maybe it's a formatting error. Let's parse the current board correctly. Let's list the rows as 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9), each row having 9 cells.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? → Wait, but 9 cells. Let's count each row's elements. The first line: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" has 16 elements. That's probably a mistake. Maybe the user intended each row to be 9 cells. Let's assume that the current board is 9x9, and the display is cut off. Let's look for the actual 9x9 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is as presented, but the user made a mistake in formatting. Let's focus on the visible cells. The first 9 rows (0-8) and columns 0-8. Let's list the cells we can see:\n\nRow 0, columns 0-8: 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ? (since the 9th cell is the 9th element in the first line, which is the 9th position, index 8)\nRow 1: 0, 0, 1, 2, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?\nRow 2: 0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, 2, ?\nRow 3: 0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 4: 0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 5: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 6: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 7: 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 8: ?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?\n\nWait, maybe each row is 9 cells. Let's count each row's elements. For example, the first line: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" — that's 16 elements. Maybe it's a typo, and the actual rows are 9 cells each. Let's take the first 9 elements of each line as the row. Let's list the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, ?, 1, 0, 1, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, 2, ?]\nRow 3: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\n\nThat makes 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Now, the cells with '?' are uncovered, 'F' are flagged, and numbers are uncovered safe cells with the count of adjacent mines.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.08695652173913043, which is 2\/23 (since 2\/23 ≈ 0.087). So, the user has flagged 2 mines, but 23 flags in total (probably some incorrect flags). But according to the rules, the final score is correct flags \/ total mines (10), so 2 correct flags so far.\n\nWe need to make a move: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nLet's look for safe cells to uncover. Uncovering a mine ends the game, so we need to find cells that are definitely safe.\n\nLet's start with the known cells. For example, in row 0, column 0: 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are already uncovered (0,1 is 0, 1,0 is 0, 1,1 is 0), so that's consistent.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 3: it's flagged (F). Let's check if that's a possible mine. The cell (2,3) is flagged. Let's look at adjacent cells. The cell (2,2) is 1. The 1 at (2,2) has adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,2): (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The cell (2,2) is 1, so there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. Let's see which are uncovered:\n\n(1,1): 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0) → safe.\n(1,2): 1 (row 1, column 2 is 1) → safe.\n(1,3): 2 (row 1, column 3 is 2) → safe.\n(2,1): 0 (row 2, column 1 is 0) → safe.\n(2,3): F (flagged) → possible mine.\n(3,1): 1 (row 3, column 1 is 1) → safe.\n(3,2): 2 (row 3, column 2 is 2) → safe.\n(3,3): 2 (row 3, column 3 is 2) → safe.\n\nSo the only possible mine adjacent to (2,2) is (2,3). Since (2,2) is 1, that means (2,3) must be a mine. So the flag at (2,3) is correct. That's one correct flag.\n\nAnother flagged cell is in row 4, column 2: (4,2) is F. Let's check if that's a mine. Let's look at adjacent cells. The cell (4,1) is 1. (4,1) has adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (4,1) is 1, so one mine in those cells.\n\nCheck the adjacent cells:\n\n(3,0): 0 (row 3, column 0 is 0) → safe.\n(3,1): 1 (row 3, column 1 is 1) → safe.\n(3,2): 2 (row 3, column 2 is 2) → safe.\n(4,0): 0 (row 4, column 0 is 0) → safe.\n(4,2): F (flagged) → possible mine.\n(5,0): 0 (row 5, column 0 is 0) → safe.\n(5,1): 1 (row 5, column 1 is 1) → safe.\n(5,2): 1 (row 5, column 2 is 1) → safe.\n\nSo the only possible mine adjacent to (4,1) is (4,2). Since (4,1) is 1, (4,2) must be a mine. So the flag at (4,2) is correct. That's the second correct flag (matches the score 2\/10).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. Let's check cells with known numbers and their adjacent unknown cells.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 7 is 1. Let's list its adjacent cells. (0,7) is in row 0, column 7. Adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). \n\n(0,6) is 0 (safe), (0,8) is ? (unknown), (1,6) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (safe), (1,8) is ? (unknown). So (0,7) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (0,8) and (1,8). But (0,7) is 1, so one of these two is a mine. Not sure yet.\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). \n\n(0,2): 0 (safe), (0,3):1 (safe), (0,4):1 (safe), (1,2):1 (safe), (1,4):? (unknown), (2,2):1 (safe), (2,3):F (mine), (2,4):2 (safe). So (1,3) is 2. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (1,4) and (2,3) (but (2,3) is a mine). So (2,3) is a mine, which contributes 1 to the 2. So (1,3) has 2 mines, so (1,4) must be a mine? Because (2,3) is 1, so (1,4) must be the second mine. Let's verify: (1,3) is 2, adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,4)=2. So the mine count here is 1 (from (2,3)) plus (1,4) if it's a mine. So 1 + (1,4) mine = 2 → (1,4) must be a mine. So (1,4) should be flagged. But currently, (1,4) is '?', so maybe we should flag it. But wait, let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, (2,4) is 2. Let's check (2,4): 2. Adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). \n\n(1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. So (2,4) is 2. The adjacent mines are (2,3) (1) and maybe (1,4). So 1 + (1,4) mine = 2 → (1,4) is a mine. That's consistent. So (1,4) is a mine. So we should flag (1,4).\n\nBut let's check another cell. Row 3, column 5 is 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. (3,5) is 0. Adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). \n\n(2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All these are uncovered and safe (since 0's adjacent cells are safe). So (3,5) being 0 is correct, no mines around.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). All of these are uncovered and safe (numbers 2,1,0,1,0,1,0,0), so no mines, which is consistent with 0.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is 1. Adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). \n\n(5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?. So (6,6) is 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). \n\n(6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. So (7,3) is 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (8,2). So (8,2) could be a mine, but let's check (8,3) is 1. (8,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). But row 8 is the last row (since 9x9), so (9,2) etc. are out of bounds. So (8,3) adjacent cells are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. So (8,3) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The possible mine is (8,2). So (8,2) is a mine? Then (7,3) being 1 would have (8,2) as the mine. That's possible.\n\nBut maybe let's find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a cell with a number that has all adjacent flags except one, or a 0 that has adjacent unknowns.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 6 is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). \n\n(0,5)=1 (safe), (0,7)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=0 (safe), (1,7)=1 (safe). So all adjacent cells are safe, which is consistent with 0. No unknowns here.\n\nRow 1, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). \n\n(0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2. All safe, consistent with 0.\n\nRow 2, column 6 is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). \n\n(1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?. So (2,6) is 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (3,7). So (3,7) could be a mine. But (3,6) is 1. Let's check (3,6)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). \n\n(2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknowns are (3,7) and (4,7). So maybe one of them is a mine.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell that has adjacent unknowns. For example, row 6, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). All of these are uncovered (row 5,0=0; row 5,1=1; row 6,1=0; row7,0=1; row7,1=2). So no unknowns here.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). \n\n(5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All safe, no unknowns.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered, as checked earlier.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). \n\n(3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. All safe, no unknowns.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). \n\nAll are 0 or 1, safe. No unknowns.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). \n\n(6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. All safe, no unknowns.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, so the remaining adjacent unknowns are safe. For example, row 2, column 7 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,7)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). \n\n(1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. So (2,7)=2. How many mines are here? The known flags are none in adjacent cells. So 2 mines in the unknowns: (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). Not helpful.\n\nRow 1, column 7 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). \n\n(0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (2,8)=?. So (1,7)=1. So 1 mine in (0,8), (1,8), (2,8). \n\nRow 0, column 8 is ?. Let's see (0,7)=1. (0,7) has adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?. So (0,7)=1, which means 1 mine in (0,8) and (1,8). So either (0,8) or (1,8) is a mine, but not both.\n\nIf we can find a cell where the number of adjacent unknowns equals the number, then those are mines. But maybe let's look for a safe cell to uncover. For example, cells that are adjacent to 0s. Wait, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe, so any unknown cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nWait, let's check row 6, column 7. The cell (6,7) is ?. What's adjacent to it? (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). \n\n(5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=?, (6,6)=1, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 7, column 7 is ?. Adjacent cells: (6,6), (6,7), (6,8), (7,6), (7,8), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8). All unknown except (6,6)=1, (7,6)=1.\n\nRow 8, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=invalid, (9,3)=invalid, (9,4)=invalid. So (8,3)=1. The adjacent cells are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. So (8,3) is 1, which means 1 mine in these. (7,2)=2 (has 2 mines around it), (7,3)=1 (has 1 mine), (7,4)=0 (safe). So (8,2) is a possible mine here. But (7,2)=2: let's check (7,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). \n\n(6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1. So (7,2)=2, which means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The unknowns are (8,1) and (8,2). So (8,1) and (8,2) could be the two mines. Then (8,3)=1 would have (8,2) as a mine, which fits. So (8,1) and (8,2) are mines. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 7 is ?. Let's see (3,6)=1. (3,6) has adjacent cells: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=1. The known adjacent cells have 0 mines (since all are numbers), so the 1 mine must be in (3,7) or (4,7). So either one is a mine. Not safe to uncover.\n\nRow 4, column 7 is ?. (4,6)=1. (4,6) adjacent cells: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?. So (4,6)=1. So 1 mine in (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). \n\nRow 5, column 7 is ?. (5,6)=1. (5,6) adjacent cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. So (5,6)=1. 1 mine in (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe we should look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe, so any unknown cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's check all 0 cells and their adjacent unknowns.\n\nLooking for 0 cells in the current board:\n\nRow 0, columns 0-2: 0,0,0.\n\nRow 1, columns 0-1: 0,0.\n\nRow 2, columns 0-1: 0,0.\n\nRow 3, column 0: 0.\n\nRow 4, columns 0: 0.\n\nRow 5, column 0: 0.\n\nRow 6, columns 0-5: 0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 7, columns 4-5: 0,0.\n\nRow 4, columns 4-5: 0,0.\n\nRow 5, columns 4-5: 0,0.\n\nRow 3, column 5: 0.\n\nThese 0 cells have all adjacent cells already uncovered (since the 0s are in the top-left area, and their adjacent cells are all numbers, not unknowns). So no unknowns adjacent to 0s that can be safely uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: the cells that are unknown are mostly in the right and bottom parts of the board. Let's look for a cell that is likely safe. For example, row 8, column 5 is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (8,5)=1. Adjacent cells: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4)=invalid, (9,5)=invalid, (9,6)=invalid. \n\n(7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=1. So (8,5)=1. The adjacent cells are all safe except possibly none, so (8,5) is 1, which is consistent. No unknowns here.\n\nRow 8, column 6 is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5)=invalid, (9,6)=invalid, (9,7)=invalid. \n\n(7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=?. So (8,6)=1. So 1 mine in (7,7) or (8,7). \n\nHmm. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is likely safe. Let's look at row 0, column 8. It's '?'. The cell (0,7) is 1, which has adjacent cells (0,8) and (1,8) as unknowns. Since (0,7)=1, one of them is a mine. If we uncover (0,8), if it's a mine, the game ends. If it's safe, it will show the number of adjacent mines. But maybe (0,8) is safe. Alternatively, (1,8) is '?'. (1,7)=1, which has (0,8), (1,8), (2,8) as unknowns. So (1,7)=1, so one mine in those three.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 8. It's '?'. (2,7)=2, which has (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8) as unknowns. (2,7)=2, so two mines there.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest bet is to uncover a cell that is in an area with many 0s, but all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Alternatively, let's look at row 7, column 8. It's '?'. (7,7) is '?', (7,8) is '?'. (7,6)=1. (7,6) adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). \n\n(6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?. So (7,6)=1. So 1 mine in (6,7), (7,7), (8,7). \n\nNot helpful. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell in the bottom-right where there's a 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a cell that is definitely safe based on the known information.\n\nWait, let's revisit the flagged cells. We have two correct flags: (2,3) and (4,2). The total mines are 10, so there are 8 more mines to find. The user has flagged 23 times, which means 21 incorrect flags. But the current board shows only two 'F's, so maybe the \"Flags: 2\/23\" means 2 correct out of 23 flagged. So there are 23 flagged cells, but only 2 are correct. That's a lot of incorrect flags. So we might need to unflag some, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the problem says to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nBut the user's current action options are to uncover, flag, or unflag. Since the score is based on correct flags \/ total mines, we need to flag the remaining 8 mines. But we need to find which cells are mines.\n\nEarlier, we thought (1,4) is a mine. Let's confirm again. (1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,4)=2. So (1,3)=2. The known mine is (2,3), so there's 1 more mine. The only other unknown adjacent cell is (1,4). So (1,4) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (1,4).\n\nLet's check (2,4)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=F (mine), (2,5)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. So (2,4)=2. Known mine is (2,3), so 1 more mine. The unknown adjacent cell is (1,4). So (1,4) is a mine. Yes, that's consistent. So (1,4) is a mine. Therefore, the action should be to flag (1,4).\n\nAnswer: flag (1,4)","flag (1,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The board provided is a 16x16 grid, but maybe the initial description said 9x9? Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but the current board has 15 rows, each with 15 cells. Let's focus on the visible part.\n\nThe input shows that some cells are uncovered with numbers, some are flagged (F), and most are unknown (?). The score is 0.13, which is 3 correct flags out of 10 total mines. So, 3 flags are correct, and 20 flags are incorrect (since Flags: 3\/23, meaning 23 total flags placed, 3 correct). The user has 0 unflags, so they haven't unflagged any yet.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nFirst, let's look at the visible cells to find safe cells to uncover or identify mines.\n\nLooking at the first row (row 0): [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] So row 0, columns 0-7 are uncovered. The 0s mean no adjacent mines. So, for example, cell (0,0) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells (which are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) are safe. Since (0,0) is 0, those adjacent cells can't be mines. Similarly, (0,1) is 0, so adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are safe. But (0,0) and (0,1) are already 0, so (0,2) and (1,2) are safe. (0,2) is 0, so adjacent cells (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are safe. (0,3) is 1, so it has one adjacent mine. Let's check (0,3) adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 1 (from row 1, column 2: row 1 is [0,0,1,2,F,1,0,1,...] so (1,2) is 1. So (0,3) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Let's list them:\n\n(0,3) adjacent cells:\n- (0,2): 0 (safe)\n- (0,4): 1 (from row 0, column 4 is 1)\n- (1,2): 1 (row 1, column 2)\n- (1,3): 2 (row 1, column 3 is 2)\n- (1,4): F (row 1, column 4 is flagged)\n\nSo (0,3) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells. The flagged cell (1,4) is a candidate. If (1,4) is a mine, that would account for the 1 in (0,3). Let's check row 1, column 3: it's 2. The adjacent cells for (1,3) are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Let's list their values:\n\n(0,2): 0 (safe)\n(0,3): 1 (safe)\n(0,4): 1 (safe)\n(1,2): 1 (safe)\n(1,4): F (flagged)\n(2,2): 1 (row 2, column 2 is 1)\n(2,3): F (row 2, column 3 is F)\n(2,4): 2 (row 2, column 4 is 2)\n\nSo (1,3) is 2, which means there are 2 mines in those 8 cells. The flagged cells here are (1,4) and (2,3). If both are mines, that's 2, which matches the 2 in (1,3). That's a good sign. Let's check row 2, column 3 (F). Let's see (2,3)'s adjacent cells. The cell (2,3) is flagged, so if it's a mine, then the numbers around it should reflect that. Let's look at row 2, column 4 (which is 2). The cell (2,4) is 2, so adjacent mines are 2. Its adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,3) is 2 (safe), (1,4) is F, (1,5) is 1 (row 1, column 5 is 1), (2,3) is F, (2,5) is 1 (row 2, column 5 is 1), (3,3) is 2 (row 3, column 3 is 2), (3,4) is 1 (row 3, column 4 is 1), (3,5) is 0 (row 3, column 5 is 0). So (2,4) is 2, which would need 2 mines in adjacent cells. The flagged cells (1,4) and (2,3) are two, so that matches. So (1,4) and (2,3) are likely correct flags.\n\nRow 4, column 2 is F (row 4: [0,1,F,1,0,0,1,...]). Let's check (4,2) (F). The cell (4,1) is 1 (row 4, column 1 is 1). (4,1)'s adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is 0 (row 3, column 0 is 0), (3,1) is 1 (row 3, column 1 is 1), (3,2) is 2 (row 3, column 2 is 2), (4,0) is 0 (row 4, column 0 is 0), (4,2) is F, (5,0) is 0 (row 5, column 0 is 0), (5,1) is 1 (row 5, column 1 is 1), (5,2) is 1 (row 5, column 2 is 1). So (4,1) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only flagged cell here is (4,2). So if (4,2) is a mine, that's 1, which matches. So (4,2) is likely a correct flag. That's the third correct flag (since score is 3\/10).\n\nNow, looking for safe cells to uncover. Let's look at cells with 0, as they have no adjacent mines, so their adjacent unknown cells can be uncovered safely. For example, row 0, column 0-2 are 0. Let's check row 0, column 7: it's 1. So (0,7) is 1, adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6) is 0 (safe), (1,6) is 0 (row 1, column 6 is 0), (1,7) is 1 (row 1, column 7 is 1). So (0,7) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cells here are (0,8), (1,8). So either (0,8) or (1,8) is a mine, but we can't be sure yet.\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,...]. So row 6, columns 0-5 are 0. The cell (6,6) is 1. So (6,6) has 1 adjacent mine. Its adjacent cells are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 0 (row 5, column 5 is 0), (5,6) is 1 (row 5, column 6 is 1), (5,7) is ? (unknown), (6,5) is 0 (safe), (6,7) is ? (unknown), (7,5) is 0 (row 7, column 5 is 0), (7,6) is 1 (row 7, column 6 is 1), (7,7) is ? (unknown). So (6,6) is 1, so one of (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) is a mine.\n\nRow 7, column 0: [1,2,2,1,0,0,1,...]. (7,0) is 1, adjacent cells are (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (6,0) is 0 (safe), (6,1) is 0 (safe), (7,1) is 2, (8,0) is ? (unknown), (8,1) is ? (unknown). So (7,0) is 1, which means one mine in (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). But (7,1) is 2, which has its own adjacent mines.\n\nLooking for 0 cells. For example, row 0, columns 0-2 are 0, so all adjacent cells to these 0s are safe. Let's check row 1, column 0: it's 0. So (1,0) is 0, adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All these are safe, so (2,0) and (2,1) are safe. Row 2, column 0 is 0 (row 2: [0,0,1,F,2,1,1,2,...]), so (2,0) is 0, adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0), (2,1) is 0 (row 2, column 1 is 0), (3,0) is 0 (row 3, column 0 is 0), (3,1) is 1 (row 3, column 1 is 1). So all these are safe. So (3,0) is 0, which is safe. So the 0s in the top-left corner form a large safe area, and their adjacent unknown cells can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8: it's ?, which is adjacent to (0,7) (1), (1,7) (1), (1,8) (unknown). Since (0,7) is 1, which has one adjacent mine, and (1,7) is 1, which also has one adjacent mine. Let's check (1,7): (1,7) is 1, adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,6) is 0 (safe), (0,7) is 1 (safe), (1,6) is 0 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (row 2, column 6 is 1), (2,7) is 2 (row 2, column 7 is 2). So (1,7) is 1, which means one mine in (0,8), (1,8), (2,8). If (0,8) is a mine, then (0,7) would have that mine, and (1,7) would also have that mine. But (0,7) is 1, so only one mine. So if (0,8) is a mine, then (1,7) would have that mine as one, but (1,7) is 1, so that's possible. Alternatively, (1,8) could be the mine for both (0,7) and (1,7). But without more info, maybe it's safer to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, as those are guaranteed safe.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 0-5 are 0. So (6,5) is 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. (6,5) is in row 6, column 5. Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4) is 0 (row 5, column 4 is 0), (5,5) is 0 (row 5, column 5 is 0), (5,6) is 1 (row 5, column 6 is 1), (6,4) is 0 (safe), (6,6) is 1 (row 6, column 6 is 1), (7,4) is 0 (row 7, column 4 is 0), (7,5) is 0 (row 7, column 5 is 0), (7,6) is 1 (row 7, column 6 is 1). So (6,5) being 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So (5,6) is 1 (safe), (6,6) is 1 (safe), (7,6) is 1 (safe). So the cells adjacent to (6,5) are safe, but they are already uncovered. What about (6,7)? It's ?, adjacent to (6,6) (1). Since (6,6) is 1, which has one adjacent mine, and (6,7) is adjacent to (6,6), but (6,5) is 0, so (6,7) is adjacent to (6,5) (0), which means (6,7) is safe? Wait, no. The 0 in (6,5) means all 8 adjacent cells to (6,5) are safe. (6,7) is not adjacent to (6,5) because (6,5) is column 5, so adjacent columns are 4,5,6. So (6,7) is column 7, which is two away from 5, so not adjacent. So (6,7) is not adjacent to (6,5).\n\nAnother area: row 3, column 5 is 0 (row 3: [0,1,2,2,1,0,1,...]). (3,5) is 0, so adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Let's check these: (2,4) is 2 (row 2, column 4 is 2), (2,5) is 1 (row 2, column 5 is 1), (2,6) is 1 (row 2, column 6 is 1), (3,4) is 1 (row 3, column 4 is 1), (3,6) is 1 (row 3, column 6 is 1), (4,4) is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0), (4,5) is 0 (row 4, column 5 is 0), (4,6) is 1 (row 4, column 6 is 1). So (3,5) is 0, meaning all these adjacent cells are safe. So (4,4) and (4,5) are 0, which are safe. The cell (4,5) is 0, so its adjacent cells are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). All of these are safe (since (4,5) is 0), so (5,4), (5,5), (5,6) are safe. (5,4) is 0 (row 5, column 4 is 0), (5,5) is 0 (row 5, column 5 is 0), (5,6) is 1 (row 5, column 6 is 1). So (5,5) is 0, so its adjacent cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are all safe. (6,4) is 0 (row 6, column 4 is 0), (6,5) is 0 (row 6, column 5 is 0), (6,6) is 1 (row 6, column 6 is 1). So all these 0s in rows 3-6, columns 4-5 form a large safe area. The unknown cells adjacent to these 0s are likely safe to uncover.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 7 is ? (row 3: [0,1,2,2,1,0,1,?,...]). Let's check (3,6) which is 1 (row 3, column 6 is 1). (3,6) is 1, so it has one adjacent mine. Its adjacent cells are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5) is 1 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (2,7) is 2 (row 2, column 7 is 2), (3,5) is 0 (safe), (4,5) is 0 (safe), (4,6) is 1 (safe). So (3,6) is 1, so one mine in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). (2,7) is 2, which has its own adjacent mines. (2,7) is 2, adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (3,6) is 1 (safe). So (2,7) is 2, so two mines in (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). \n\nBut maybe instead of focusing on mines, let's find a cell that's definitely safe. For example, the top-left corner has a lot of 0s, so the unknown cells adjacent to them are safe. Let's look at row 0, column 8: it's ?, but adjacent to (0,7) (1) and (1,7) (1). Maybe not. What about row 8, column 3: (8,3) is 1 (row 8: [?,?,?,1,1,1,1,...]). (8,3) is 1, adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,2) is 2 (row 7, column 2 is 2), (7,3) is 1 (row 7, column 3 is 1), (7,4) is 0 (row 7, column 4 is 0), (8,4) is 1 (row 8, column 4 is 1). So (7,4) is 0, which means all adjacent cells to (7,4) are safe. (7,4) is in row 7, column 4. Adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3) is 0 (row 6, column 3 is 0), (6,4) is 0 (row 6, column 4 is 0), (6,5) is 0 (row 6, column 5 is 0), (7,3) is 1 (safe), (7,5) is 0 (safe), (8,3) is 1 (safe), (8,4) is 1 (safe), (8,5) is 1 (safe). So (7,4) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (8,3) is adjacent to (7,4) (0), so (8,3) is safe? Wait, no: (7,4) being 0 means its adjacent cells are safe, but (8,3) is adjacent to (7,4), so (8,3) is safe. But (8,3) is already uncovered as 1, so that's correct. The cell (8,5) is 1 (row 8, column 5 is 1), which is adjacent to (7,4) (0), so (8,5) is safe. \n\nLooking for the first unknown cell adjacent to a 0. Let's take row 0, column 8: adjacent to (0,7) (1) and (1,7) (1), but maybe not. What about row 1, column 8: it's ?, adjacent to (1,7) (1), (0,7) (1), (0,8) (?), (2,7) (2), (2,8) (unknown). Maybe not. \n\nAnother approach: the 0s in row 0, columns 0-2 mean that all cells adjacent to them are safe. For example, (0,0) is 0, so (1,0) and (1,1) are safe (they are 0). (1,0) is 0, so (2,0) and (2,1) are safe (they are 0). (2,0) is 0, so (3,0) is safe (it's 0). (3,0) is 0, so (4,0) is safe (row 4, column 0 is 0). (4,0) is 0, so (5,0) is safe (row 5, column 0 is 0). (5,0) is 0, so (6,0) is safe (row 6, column 0 is 0). (6,0) is 0, so (7,0) is safe (row 7, column 0 is 1). Wait, (7,0) is 1, which is safe (it's a number, not a mine). So the entire leftmost column from row 0 to 6 is 0, so all those cells are safe, and their adjacent cells are safe. \n\nThe unknown cells in the top-left area are row 0, columns 8-14; row 1, columns 8-14; etc. But maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe. For example, let's look at row 6, column 7: it's ?, adjacent to (6,6) (1). (6,6) is 1, which has one adjacent mine. But (6,7) is also adjacent to (5,7) (unknown) and (7,7) (unknown). Alternatively, let's look at row 7, column 7: it's ?, adjacent to (7,6) (1), (6,6) (1), (6,7) (unknown), (8,6) (unknown), (8,7) (unknown). \n\nWait, let's check row 3, column 7: it's ?. (3,6) is 1, so (3,7) is adjacent to (3,6). If (3,6) is 1, then one of its adjacent cells is a mine. The adjacent cells to (3,6) are (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5) is 1 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (3,5) is 0 (safe), (4,5) is 0 (safe), (4,6) is 1 (safe). So the possible mines are (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). (2,7) is 2 (row 2, column 7 is 2). (2,7) being 2 has adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (3,6) is 1 (safe). So (2,7) is 2, so two mines in (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's in a known safe area. For example, the 0s in row 0, column 0-2 extend down, so the cells to the right of these 0s might be safe. Let's look at row 0, column 7: it's 1, and to its right is row 0, column 8 (unknown). But maybe a better choice is row 7, column 7 (unknown). Alternatively, let's look for a cell that's adjacent to multiple 0s. For example, row 6, column 7: adjacent to (6,6) (1), (5,6) (1), (5,7) (unknown), (7,6) (1), (7,7) (unknown). \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the user has 23 flags, 3 correct, so 20 incorrect. They need to unflag those, but the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag. The user hasn't unflagged any yet, so maybe unflagging some incorrect flags would help, but the problem is identifying which flags are incorrect. For example, row 1, column 4 is F (flagged). We thought that might be a correct flag. Row 2, column 3 is F, also possibly correct. Row 4, column 2 is F, possibly correct. The other 20 flags are incorrect. For example, let's check row 2, column 3 (F). If (2,3) is a mine, then the cell (3,3) (which is 2) has adjacent mines. (3,3) is 2, adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2) is 1 (safe), (2,3) is F (mine?), (2,4) is 2 (safe), (3,2) is 2 (safe), (3,4) is 1 (safe), (4,2) is F (mine?), (4,3) is 1 (safe), (4,4) is 0 (safe). So (3,3) is 2, which would need two mines. If (2,3) and (4,2) are mines, that's two, which matches. So those two flags are correct. So that's three correct flags: (1,4), (2,3), (4,2). So the other 20 flags are incorrect. For example, any other F in the board is likely incorrect. Let's check the current board:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,2,F,1,0,1,...] → F at (1,4)\nRow 2: [0,0,1,F,2,1,1,2,...] → F at (2,3)\nRow 4: [0,1,F,1,0,0,1,...] → F at (4,2)\nAre there other Fs? The board rows are:\n\nRow 0: ... no F\nRow 1: F at (1,4)\nRow 2: F at (2,3)\nRow 3: ... no F\nRow 4: F at (4,2)\nRows 5-15: ... no F mentioned (since the board is shown as ??? for those). So maybe only 3 flags in the visible part, and 20 in the unknown part. So unflagging those 20 would be good, but we don't know where they are. \n\nSince the user's score is 3\/10, they need to flag 7 more mines. But uncovering safe cells is another way to win. The win condition is to uncover all safe cells (which are 81-10=71 cells in a 9x9 grid, but the current board is 16x16, maybe a mistake). Assuming the board is 9x9, there are 81 cells, 10 mines, 71 safe. If the user uncovers all 71 safe cells, they win. \n\nLooking at the current board, the visible uncovered cells are in rows 0-8, columns 0-7 (mostly). The rest are unknown. The 0s in the top-left suggest that many of the adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0, column 8 is unknown. Let's assume it's safe and uncover it. Or row 1, column 8. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's definitely safe. For example, row 6, column 7: adjacent to (6,6) (1). (6,6) is 1, which has one adjacent mine. The adjacent cells to (6,6) are (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5) is 0 (safe), (5,6) is 1 (safe), (6,5) is 0 (safe), (7,5) is 0 (safe), (7,6) is 1 (safe). So the possible mines are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). If (6,7) is safe, then uncovering it would be okay. But we can't be sure. \n\nAnother approach: the first move is usually to uncover a corner, but here the top-left is already uncovered. Maybe uncover a cell adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 8 is adjacent to (0,7) (1), but (0,7) is 1, so it has one mine in adjacent cells. If (0,8) is not a mine, then uncovering it would show a number. Let's pick row 0, column 8. \n\nWait, the current board's first row is: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → columns 0-14. So row 0, column 8 is the first ?. Let's uncover (0,8).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,8)","uncover (0,8)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules and the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0-8 and columns 0-8, with some cells uncovered, flagged, or still unknown (marked as ?). The score is based on correctly flagged mines, and we need to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells to win.\n\nFirst, let's parse the current board. The user provided the board as rows, each separated by a newline. Let's list out the rows with their indices (row 0 to row 8, since 9x9). Each row has 9 cells, but looking at the input, maybe the user made a formatting mistake? Wait, the input shows rows like \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which has more than 9 cells. Oh, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps the actual board is 9x9. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells. Let me check again. The user probably made a mistake in the board display, but let's focus on the 9x9 part.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the board is 9x9. So maybe the input provided has some formatting issues. Let's try to correct that. Let's take each row as 9 cells. For example, the first row: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1\" (9 cells). The next rows similarly. The rest of the ? are probably part of a larger display, but the actual board is 9x9. So rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nNow, let's list the current state of each cell (row, col) where row and col are 0-8. Let's go row by row:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, F, 1, 0, 1, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, 2, ?]\nRow 3: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\n\nWait, maybe that's a better way to parse. The user's input might have each row split with spaces, and the ? are the unknown cells. Let's confirm:\n\nOriginal current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → probably 9 cells, so first 9 are 0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1. The rest are maybe extra, but ignore.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 1 2 F 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,0,1,2,F,1,0,1,?\n\nRow 2: 0 0 1 F 2 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,0,1,F,2,1,1,2,?\n\nRow 3: 0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,1,2,2,1,0,1,?,?\n\nRow 4: 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,1,F,1,0,0,1,?,?\n\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,1,1,1,0,0,1,?,?\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?\n\nRow 7: 1 2 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: 1,2,2,1,0,0,1,?,?\n\nRow 8: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → first 9: ?,?,?,1,1,1,1,?,?\n\nSo, the known cells are from (0,0) to (8,6), and columns 7 and 8 in rows 1-8 are unknown, as well as row 8 columns 0-2 and 7-8.\n\nNow, let's note the flagged cells (F) and check if they are correct. The current flags are at (1,4), (2,3), (4,2). The score is 3\/23, which probably means 3 correct flags out of 23 total flags (but the problem says total mines are 10, so maybe 3 correct flags out of 23 attempted, which is why the score is 3\/10=0.3? Wait the score is 0.13043478260869565, which is 3\/23 (since 3 divided by 23 is approximately 0.1304). Oh right, the score is (correct flags) \/ total mines (10), but the user's note says \"Flags: 3\/23\" which probably means 3 correct flags out of 23 flagged cells. So the user has flagged 23 cells, 3 of which are correct mines, and 20 are incorrect. So the current flags include 3 correct and 20 incorrect.\n\nOur goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. Safe cells are those that are not mines and can be determined by the numbers.\n\nLet's start analyzing the known cells.\n\nRow 0, columns 0-8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1]. All these are uncovered, and their numbers indicate adjacent mines. Since they are 0,1, etc., and they are already uncovered, no mines there.\n\nRow 1: [0,0,1,2,F,1,0,1,?]. Let's check (1,4) is flagged (F). Let's see the number at (1,3) which is 2. The cell (1,3) is 2, so it has 2 adjacent mines. The adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Let's list them:\n\n(0,2): 0 (uncovered, not mine)\n(0,3): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(0,4): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(1,2): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(1,4): F (flagged, possible mine)\n(2,2): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(2,3): F (flagged, possible mine)\n(2,4): 2 (uncovered, not mine)\n\nSo the 2 at (1,3) has adjacent cells: (1,4) and (2,3) are flagged. So if both are mines, then the 2 is satisfied. But let's check other numbers.\n\nLooking at (2,3) which is F (flagged). The cell (2,2) is 1. (2,2) has adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (2,1) is 0, (2,3) is F, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2, (3,3) is 2. So (2,2) is 1, which should have 1 mine adjacent. The only possible mine here is (2,3) (since others are uncovered and not mines). So (2,3) must be a mine (because 1 mine is needed here). So the flag at (2,3) is correct.\n\nThen (1,3) is 2, which needs 2 mines. (2,3) is a mine, so the other mine must be in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). (0,4) is 1 (uncovered, not mine), (2,4) is 2 (uncovered, not mine), so (1,4) must be the second mine. So (1,4) is a mine, so the flag there is correct. That's two correct flags.\n\nRow 4 has a flag at (4,2). Let's check (4,1) which is 1. (4,1) is 1, so adjacent mines: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0) is 0, (3,1) is 1, (3,2) is 2, (4,0) is 0, (4,2) is F, (5,0) is 0, (5,1) is 1, (5,2) is 1. All others are uncovered except (4,2). So (4,1) is 1, which needs 1 mine. The only possible mine is (4,2). So (4,2) must be a mine. So that's the third correct flag. So the 3 correct flags are (1,4), (2,3), (4,2).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. Let's check cells with number 0, which have no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells can be uncovered. But all 0s in the known area are already uncovered. For example, row 0, columns 0-2 are 0, so their adjacent cells are safe, but those are already uncovered.\n\nNext, look at cells with numbers that have all adjacent mines accounted for, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nFor example, let's take (0,6) which is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 1, (0,7) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 1. All are uncovered, so no mines there.\n\n(1,6) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2. All uncovered, so no mines.\n\n(2,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=? (unknown). The number 1 here means there's 1 mine in these adjacent cells. Let's see which are unknown: (3,7). So if (2,6) is 1, and all other adjacent cells are uncovered (non-mines), then (3,7) must be a mine? Wait no: (2,6) is 1, so among its 8 adjacent cells, 1 is a mine. Let's list them:\n\n(1,5): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(1,6): 0 (uncovered, not mine)\n(1,7): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(2,5): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(2,7): 2 (uncovered, not mine)\n(3,5): 0 (uncovered, not mine)\n(3,6): 1 (uncovered, not mine)\n(3,7): ? (unknown)\n\nSo the only unknown adjacent cell is (3,7). Since (2,6) is 1, that means (3,7) must be a mine. But wait, (3,6) is 1. Let's check (3,6) which is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?.\n\n(3,6) is 1, so it has 1 mine adjacent. The known non-mines are all except (3,7) and (4,7). So if (3,7) is a mine, then (3,6) would have 1 mine, which fits. Alternatively, if (4,7) is a mine, but let's check other cells.\n\nLet's look at (6,6) which is 1. Its adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?.\n\n(6,6) is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0: those are safe. (5,6)=1 (uncovered), (7,6)=1 (uncovered). So the unknowns are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(7,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?.\n\n(7,6) is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. Known non-mines: (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)=1 (uncovered), (8,6)=1 (uncovered). So the unknowns are (6,7), (7,7), (8,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nLet's look at (8,3) which is 1. (8,3) is 1, adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). But wait, the board is 9x9, so row 8 is the last row (0-8), so (9,2) etc. are out of bounds. So valid adjacent cells for (8,3) are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4). (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. So (8,3)=1, which means 1 mine in these adjacent cells. (7,2)=2 (uncovered, not mine), (7,3)=1 (uncovered, not mine), (7,4)=0 (uncovered, not mine), (8,4)=1 (uncovered, not mine). So the only unknown is (8,2). So (8,2) must be a mine? Because (8,3) is 1, and all other adjacent cells are safe, so (8,2) is a mine. But (8,2) is in row 8, column 2, which is currently unknown (marked as ?).\n\nBut maybe let's find cells that are definitely safe. For example, let's look at (3,5) which is 0. (3,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells of (3,5) are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4)=2 (uncovered), (2,5)=1 (uncovered), (2,6)=1 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,6)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,5)=0 (uncovered), (4,6)=1 (uncovered). All are uncovered and safe, so no new info.\n\n(4,4) is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered, safe.\n\n(5,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. All uncovered, safe.\n\n(6,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. All uncovered, safe.\n\n(7,4) is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. All uncovered, safe.\n\n(7,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. All uncovered, safe.\n\nNow, let's look at (0,7) which is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6)=0, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (0,8)=?, (1,8)=?. (0,7)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. The known non-mines are (0,6), (1,6), (1,7). So the unknowns are (0,8) and (1,8). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(0,8) is unknown. (1,8) is unknown.\n\n(1,7) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (1,6), (1,8), (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2. So (1,7)=1, which has 1 mine. The unknowns are (0,8), (1,8), (2,8). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(2,7) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,6)=1. So (2,7)=2, which needs 2 mines. The unknowns are (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). So two of these are mines.\n\n(3,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. So (3,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (3,7), (4,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(4,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. So (4,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(5,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. So (5,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(6,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. So (6,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(7,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1. So (7,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (6,7), (7,7), (8,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(8,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4). (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,4)=1. So (8,3)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknown is (8,2). So (8,2) is a mine.\n\n(8,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). Out of bounds for 9, so (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=1. So (8,4)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknown is (8,5)=1 (uncovered), so no.\n\n(8,5) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=1. So (8,5)=1, which needs 1 mine. All adjacent cells are uncovered except (9,4) etc., which are out of bounds. So no info.\n\n(8,6) is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7). (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=?. So (8,6)=1, which needs 1 mine. The unknowns are (7,7), (8,7). So one of these is a mine.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, (3,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered. What about (3,7)? Let's see (3,6) is 1, which has adjacent (3,7) and (4,7) as possible mines. If (3,7) is a mine, then (3,6) is satisfied. But (2,7) is 2, which has adjacent (3,7) as a possible mine. If (3,7) is a mine, then (2,7) needs one more mine in (1,8), (2,8), (3,8). Let's see (1,7) is 1, which has (0,8), (1,8), (2,8) as possible mines. If (1,8) is a mine, then (1,7) is satisfied. Then (2,7) would have (3,7) and (1,8) as mines, which is 2, satisfying (2,7)=2. That could work.\n\nBut maybe we can find a cell that is safe. Let's look at (0,8). (0,7) is 1, which has (0,8) and (1,8) as possible mines (since (0,6)=0, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1 are safe). So (0,8) and (1,8) have one mine. (1,7) is 1, which has (0,8), (1,8), (2,8) as possible mines (since others are safe). So (1,7) needs 1 mine, so either (0,8), (1,8), or (2,8) is a mine. If (0,8) is a mine, then (0,7) is satisfied (1 mine), and (1,7) would have (0,8) as mine, so (1,7) is satisfied. Then (2,7) is 2, which needs two mines. If (0,8) is a mine, (1,8) and (2,8) could be safe, but (2,7) has (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8) as possible mines. So if (3,7) is a mine and (3,8) is a mine, then (2,7)=2 is satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (3,7) is safe. Let's see (3,6)=1, which has (3,7) and (4,7) as possible. If (3,7) is safe, then (4,7) must be a mine. Then (4,6)=1 would need (4,7) as mine, which is satisfied. Then (5,6)=1 would need (5,7) as mine (since (4,7) is a mine, so (5,6) has (4,7) as mine, which is 1, so (5,7) must be safe). Then (6,6)=1 would need (6,7) as mine (since (5,7) is safe), and (7,6)=1 would need (7,7) as mine (since (6,7) is a mine). Then (8,6)=1 would need (8,7) as mine (since (7,7) is a mine). This could be a chain.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, (6,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2. All are uncovered, so no new info.\n\nAnother approach: the cells that are unknown and adjacent to known cells with numbers. Let's list all unknown cells (marked as ?) in the 9x9 grid. From the parsed board, the unknown cells are:\n\nRow 0, column 8: (0,8)\nRow 1, columns 8: (1,8)\nRow 2, column 8: (2,8)\nRow 3, columns 7-8: (3,7), (3,8)\nRow 4, columns 7-8: (4,7), (4,8)\nRow 5, columns 7-8: (5,7), (5,8)\nRow 6, columns 7-8: (6,7), (6,8)\nRow 7, columns 7-8: (7,7), (7,8)\nRow 8, columns 0-2, 7-8: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (8,7), (8,8)\n\nNow, let's check which of these can be safely uncovered.\n\nLet's look at (8,2). Earlier, (8,3)=1, which has adjacent cells (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1. Since (8,3)=1, and all adjacent cells except (8,2) are uncovered and not mines, (8,2) must be a mine. So (8,2) is a mine, so we shouldn't uncover it.\n\n(8,0) and (8,1): (8,0) is unknown, adjacent to (7,0)=1 and (7,1)=2. (7,0)=1 has adjacent cells (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=2, (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?. (7,0)=1 needs 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). Wait, (7,0) is (row 7, column 0). Its adjacent cells are (6,-1) invalid, (6,0), (6,1), (7,-1) invalid, (7,1), (8,-1) invalid, (8,0), (8,1). So valid cells: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=2 (uncovered, not mine). So (7,0)=1 needs 1 mine in (8,0), (8,1). So one of these is a mine.\n\n(7,1)=2 has adjacent cells (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2. So (7,1)=2 needs 2 mines in (6,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (6,2) is (row 6, column 2). Let's check (6,2): row 6 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,...], so (6,2)=0 (uncovered, not mine). So (7,1)=2 needs 2 mines in (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). We already think (8,2) is a mine (from (8,3)=1), so (8,2) is a mine. Then (7,1)=2 needs one more mine in (8,0) or (8,1). And (7,0)=1 needs 1 mine in (8,0) or (8,1). So if (8,2) is a mine, then (7,1)=2 has one mine there, so needs one more in (8,0)\/(8,1). (7,0)=1 also needs one mine in (8,0)\/(8,1). So that's consistent. So (8,0) and (8,1) have one mine, and (8,2) is a mine.\n\nSo (8,0) and (8,1) are either safe or one is a mine. We can't be sure yet.\n\nLet's look at (0,8). (0,7)=1, which has adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?. So (0,7)=1 needs 1 mine in (0,8) or (1,8). (1,7)=1 has adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (2,8)=?. So (1,7)=1 needs 1 mine in (0,8), (1,8), (2,8). So if (0,8) is a mine, then (0,7)=1 is satisfied, and (1,7)=1 is also satisfied (since (0,8) is a mine). Then (2,7)=2 needs 2 mines in (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). If (0,8) is a mine, then (1,8) and (2,8) could be safe, and (3,7) and (3,8) could be mines. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (3,8). Let's see which cells are adjacent to (3,8). (2,7)=2, (2,8)=?, (3,7)=?, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=?. (2,7)=2 needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which include (3,8). If (3,8) is safe, then the mines could be elsewhere. But we can't be sure.\n\nWait, let's look at (5,5)=0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, and (5,6)=1. (5,6)=1's adjacent cells include (5,7)=?. If (5,6)=1, and all other adjacent cells are safe, then (5,7) must be a mine? Let's check: (5,6) is (row 5, column 6). Adjacent cells are (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. So the unknowns are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). (5,6)=1 needs 1 mine here. If (4,7) is a mine (from (4,6)=1), then (5,6)=1 could have (4,7) as the mine, so (5,7) is safe. If (4,7) is safe, then (5,7) must be a mine. But we don't know (4,7).\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best approach is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is unknown. Wait, all 0s have their adjacent cells already uncovered. For example, (0,0) is 0, adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all 0, so uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we have plenty of moves. We need to uncover safe cells. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number and has a known number of mines, so the remaining cells are safe.\n\nFor example, let's take (3,7). Let's see (3,6)=1, which has adjacent cells: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=1 has 8 adjacent cells, of which 6 are uncovered and not mines. So 1 mine in (3,7) or (4,7). So 50% chance. Not safe.\n\n(4,7): adjacent to (4,6)=1, which has (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?. So (4,6)=1 has 1 mine in (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). So 33% chance.\n\n(5,7): adjacent to (5,6)=1, which has (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. So (5,6)=1 has 1 mine in (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). 33% chance.\n\n(6,7): adjacent to (6,6)=1, which has (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?. So (6,6)=1 has 1 mine in (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). 33% chance.\n\n(7,7): adjacent to (7,6)=1, which has (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?. So (7,6)=1 has 1 mine in (6,7), (7,7), (8,7). 33% chance.\n\n(8,7): adjacent to (8,6)=1, which has (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,7)=?, (9,5)=invalid, etc. So (8,6)=1 has 1 mine in (7,7), (8,7). 50% chance.\n\n(0,8): adjacent to (0,7)=1, which has (0,6)=0, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?. So 1 mine in (0,8) or (1,8). 50% chance.\n\n(1,8): adjacent to (1,7)=1, which has (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=?, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (2,8)=?. So 1 mine in (0,8), (1,8), (2,8). 33% chance.\n\n(2,8): adjacent to (2,7)=2, which has (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. So 2 mines in (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). 25% chance.\n\n(3,8): adjacent to (2,7)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,7)=?, (4,8)=?. 25% chance.\n\n(4,8): adjacent to (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=?. No known numbers adjacent, so no info.\n\n(5,8), (6,8), (7,8), (8,8): no adjacent known numbers, so no info.\n\n(8,0), (8,1): adjacent to (7,0)=1 and (7,1)=2, which we discussed earlier. 50% chance each.\n\nSo the safest cells to uncover are those with the highest probability of being safe. The cells with 33% chance of being a mine are (1,8), (5,7), (6,7), etc. The cells with 50% chance are (3,7), (4,7), (8,7), (0,8), (8,0), (8,1). The cells with 25% chance are (2,8), (3,8).\n\nBut maybe there's a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check (8,4). (8,4)=1, adjacent cells are (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=1. All are uncovered, so (8,4) is safe, but it's already uncovered.\n\nWait, (8,3) is 1, which is uncovered. (8,4) is 1, uncovered. (8,5) is 1, uncovered. (8,6) is 1, uncovered. So row 8, columns 3-6 are all 1s, uncovered.\n\nWhat about (7,7)? (7,6)=1, which has (7,7) as a possible mine. But (7,6)=1's adjacent cells are (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=?. So (7,6)=1 needs 1 mine here. If (6,7) is a mine, then (7,7) is safe. If (7,7) is a mine, then (6,7) is safe. If (8,7) is a mine, then the others are safe. So (7,7) has a 33% chance of being a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (3,5)=0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, and (3,6)=1. (3,6)=1 has (3,7) and (4,7) as possible mines. If we uncover (3,7), if it's a number, we can get more info. If it's a mine, the game ends, but since we have to take risks, maybe that's the move.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has only one unknown adjacent cell. For example, (2,2)=1. Its adjacent cells are (1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,3)=F (mine), (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. All are uncovered except (2,3) which is a mine. So (2,2)=1 is satisfied.\n\n(1,2)=1: adjacent cells (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F (mine). So (1,2)=1 has 1 mine (at (2,3)), which is correct.\n\n(4,3)=1: adjacent cells (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=F (mine), (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0. So (4,3)=1 has 1 mine (at (4,2)), which is correct.\n\n(5,3)=1: adjacent cells (4,2)=F (mine), (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0. So (5,3)=1 has 1 mine (at (4,2)), which is correct.\n\n(6,3)=0: adjacent cells (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0. All are uncovered, safe.\n\n(7,3)=1: adjacent cells (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. So (7,3)=1 needs 1 mine. The unknown is (8,2)=?, which we think is a mine. So (7,3)=1 is satisfied if (8,2) is a mine.\n\n(7,2)=2: adjacent cells (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1. So (7,2)=2 needs 2 mines. The unknowns are (8,1) and (8,2). If (8,2) is a mine, then (8,1) must be a mine to satisfy (7,2)=2. But (7,0)=1 needs 1 mine in (8,0) and (8,1). If (8,1) is a mine, then (7,0)=1 is satisfied (mine at (8,1)), and (7,1)=2 is satisfied (mines at (8,1) and (8,2)). That's possible. So (8,0) would be safe, (8,1) and (8,2) are mines.\n\nIf that's the case, then (8,0) is safe. Let's check (8,0): adjacent cells are (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, (8,1)=?. If (8,1) is a mine, then (7,0)=1 has 1 mine (at (8,1)), so (8,0) is safe. So (8,0) could be a safe cell to uncover.\n\nYes, this seems plausible. So (8,0) is a good candidate to uncover because if our earlier deductions are correct, (8,0) is safe.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,0)","uncover (8,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current board. The user mentioned it's a 9x9 grid, but the displayed board seems to have more rows and columns. Wait, maybe the current board is shown with some uncovered cells and the rest as '?'. Let's parse the given board.\n\nLooking at the current board, each row is a line of characters separated by spaces. Let's list out the rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (16 columns? That can't be right. Maybe the 9x9 grid is the main area, and the rest are typos. Wait, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the displayed board is a 9x9 with some rows and columns shown. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps the user made a formatting error. Let's assume that the first 9 rows and 9 columns are the actual game board, and the extra '?' are part of a formatting mistake. Let's focus on the first 9 rows and 9 columns.\n\nSo let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's rewrite the board correctly:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 1, 2, F, 1, 0, 1, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, 2, ?]\nRow 3: [0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [1, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\n\nNow, the goal is to either uncover safe cells or flag mines. The score is correct flags \/ 10. Currently, the user has 3 flags (Flags: 3\/23, which might mean 3 flagged, 23 total flagged? Wait, the problem says \"Flags: 3\/23\" – maybe 3 correct flags out of 23 attempted? Or 3 flagged cells, 23 total cells? The problem's score is 0.1304, which is 3\/23 (since 3\/23 ≈ 0.1304). So the user has 3 correct flags (mines) out of 23 flagged cells. But the total mines are 10, so 3 correct, 20 incorrect flags. Need to correct that.\n\nFirst, let's check the existing flagged cells (marked as 'F'). Let's list their coordinates:\n\nRow 1, column 4: (1,4)\nRow 2, column 3: (2,3)\nRow 4, column 2: (4,2)\n\nThese are the F's. Now, we need to determine if these are correct mines or not. Let's check adjacent numbers to see if these F's are necessary.\n\nTake (1,4) in row 1, column 4. The cell to the left is (1,3) which is 2. The cell (1,3) has value 2, meaning it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (1,3) are:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n(1,2), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\nLet's list their current states:\n\n(0,2): 0, (0,3):1, (0,4):1, (1,2):1, (1,4):F, (1,5):1, (2,2):1, (2,3):F, (2,4):2.\n\nSo (1,3) is 2. The adjacent cells that are F are (1,4) and (2,3). So (1,3) has 2 adjacent F's. If (1,4) and (2,3) are indeed mines, then (1,3)'s count is satisfied (2 mines). Let's check another cell that is adjacent to these F's.\n\nTake (2,4) which is 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3), (2,5), (2,6),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nCurrent states: (1,3)=2, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0.\n\nSo (2,4) is 2. The adjacent F's are (1,4) and (2,3) – that's 2. So if those are mines, (2,4) is satisfied.\n\nNow, (4,2) is F. Let's check (4,1) which is 1. (4,1) is in row 4, column 1, value 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),\n(4,0), (4,2), (4,3),\n(5,0), (5,1), (5,2)\n\nCurrent states: (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1.\n\nSo (4,1) is 1. The adjacent F is (4,2). So if (4,2) is a mine, that satisfies (4,1)'s count of 1. Let's check (4,3) which is 1. (4,3) is row 4, column 3, value 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4),\n(4,2), (4,4), (4,5),\n(5,2), (5,3), (5,4)\n\nCurrent states: (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0.\n\nSo (4,3) has 1 mine adjacent. The F at (4,2) is adjacent, so if that's a mine, that's 1, which matches. So (4,2) as a mine seems correct here.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The '?' cells are unknown. Let's find cells that are adjacent to numbers and can be determined to be safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7 is 1, column 8 is 1. Let's check (0,8): value 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=? (since row 1, column 8 is '?'). So (0,8) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7) (1), (1,7) (1), (1,8) (unknown). But (0,7) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. (1,7) is 1, also a number. So the mine must be in (1,8) if (0,8) is 1. Wait, no: (0,8) is a number, which is the count of mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The 8 adjacent cells for (0,8) (row 0, column 8) are:\n\n(0,7), (1,7), (1,8), and since it's a corner, only three cells. So (0,8) has 1 mine in those three. (0,7) is 1 (safe, since it's a number), (1,7) is 1 (safe). So the mine must be (1,8). But (1,8) is '?', so if (0,8) is 1, then (1,8) is a mine. But wait, (1,7) is 1. Let's check (1,7) which is row 1, column 7, value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,6), (0,7), (0,8),\n(1,6), (1,8), (2,6),\n(2,7), (2,8)\n\nCurrent states: (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (2,8)=?.\n\nSo (1,7) is 1. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (1,8) and (2,8) and (2,7)? Wait, (2,7) is 2 (a number, safe). (0,6)=0, (0,7)=1, (0,8)=1: all safe. (1,6)=0: safe. (2,6)=1: safe. So the only possible mines for (1,7) are (1,8) and (2,8). Since (1,7) is 1, there's 1 mine in those two. (0,8) is 1, which has adjacent cells (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) and (1,7) are safe, so (0,8)=1 implies (1,8) is a mine. Then (1,7)=1 would have (1,8) as the mine, so (2,8) would be safe. So (2,8) can be uncovered.\n\nAnother area: row 3, column 7 and 8 are '?'. Let's check row 3, column 6 which is 1. (3,6) is row 3, column 6, value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5), (3,7), (4,5),\n(4,6), (4,7)\n\nCurrent states: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?.\n\nSo (3,6)=1. The adjacent cells that are safe: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. So possible mines are (3,7) and (4,7). Since (3,6) is 1, there's 1 mine in those two.\n\nRow 4, column 6 is 1. (4,6) has adjacent cells:\n\n(3,5), (3,6), (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,7), (5,5),\n(5,6), (5,7)\n\nCurrent states: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?.\n\nSo (4,6)=1. The adjacent cells that are safe: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1. Possible mines: (3,7), (4,7), (5,7). Since (4,6)=1, one mine among these three.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 1. (5,6) has adjacent cells:\n\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7),\n(5,5), (5,7), (6,5),\n(6,6), (6,7)\n\nCurrent states: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?.\n\n(5,6)=1. Safe cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1. Possible mines: (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is 1. (6,6) has adjacent cells:\n\n(5,5), (5,6), (5,7),\n(6,5), (6,7), (7,5),\n(7,6), (7,7)\n\nCurrent states: (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?.\n\n(6,6)=1. Safe cells: (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1. Possible mines: (5,7), (6,7), (7,7). So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is 1. (7,6) has adjacent cells:\n\n(6,5), (6,6), (6,7),\n(7,5), (7,7), (8,5),\n(8,6), (8,7)\n\nCurrent states: (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?.\n\n(7,6)=1. Safe cells: (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1. Possible mines: (6,7), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7). So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 8, column 0 is 1. (8,0) has adjacent cells:\n\n(7,0), (7,1), (8,1),\nsince it's the top-left of row 8 (assuming rows 0-8). Wait, (8,0) is row 8, column 0. Its 8 adjacent cells are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (7,-1) which is invalid, (8,-1) invalid, (9,0) invalid, etc. So valid adjacent cells are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1). (7,0) is 1, (7,1) is 2, (8,1) is '?'. (8,0) is 1, so there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells. (7,0)=1 (safe), (7,1)=2 (safe), so (8,1) must be a mine? Wait, no: (7,0) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. (7,1)=2 is a number, not a mine. So (8,0)=1 implies one mine in (7,0), (7,1), (8,1). But (7,0) and (7,1) are numbers, so the mine is (8,1). So (8,1) is a mine? Maybe. But (7,1) is 2. Let's check (7,1): row 7, column 1, value 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,0), (6,1), (6,2),\n(7,0), (7,2), (8,0),\n(8,1), (8,2)\n\nCurrent states: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2, (8,0)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?.\n\nSo (7,1)=2. The adjacent cells that are safe: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2, (8,0)=1. So possible mines: (8,1), (8,2). Since (7,1)=2, there are 2 mines here. So (8,1) and (8,2) are both mines? Then (8,0)=1 would have (8,1) as a mine, which is 1 mine, matching (8,0)=1. That works. So (8,1) and (8,2) are mines.\n\nBut let's get back to finding safe cells. Let's look at row 1, column 8: '?'. Earlier, we thought (2,8) might be safe. Let's confirm. (0,8)=1 implies (1,8) is a mine. (1,7)=1 implies (1,8) is a mine (since (1,7) has 1 mine, and (1,8) is the only possible mine in its adjacent cells). Then (2,8) would be adjacent to (1,8) (mine) and (2,7)=2. (2,8) is adjacent to (1,7)=1, (1,8)=mine, (2,7)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?.\n\nBut (2,7)=2. Let's check (2,7): row 2, column 7, value 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,6), (1,7), (1,8),\n(2,6), (2,8), (3,6),\n(3,7), (3,8)\n\nCurrent states: (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?.\n\n(2,7)=2. So there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,6)=1 are safe. So possible mines: (1,8), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). If (1,8) is a mine (from (0,8)=1), then (2,7) has 1 mine so far, so there's 1 more mine among (2,8), (3,7), (3,8).\n\nBut maybe there's a safer cell. Let's look at row 3, column 5: 0. (3,5)=0, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's list them:\n\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\n(3,4), (3,6), (4,4),\n(4,5), (4,6)\n\nCurrent states: (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1. All are numbers, so (3,5)=0 is correct, and all adjacent cells are safe. So any cell adjacent to (3,5)=0 that is '?' can be uncovered safely.\n\nThe cells adjacent to (3,5)=0 are already uncovered (since (3,5) is 0 and all adjacent are numbers). So no help there.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 4: 0. (4,4)=0, adjacent cells:\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,5), (5,3),\n(5,4), (5,5)\n\nCurrent states: (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All are numbers, so safe.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5),\n(5,3), (5,5), (6,3),\n(6,4), (6,5)\n\nCurrent states: (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=1, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 6, column 3: 0. (6,3)=0, adjacent cells:\n\n(5,2), (5,3), (5,4),\n(6,2), (6,4), (7,2),\n(7,3), (7,4)\n\nCurrent states: (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 7, column 4: 0. (7,4)=0, adjacent cells:\n\n(6,3), (6,4), (6,5),\n(7,3), (7,5), (8,3),\n(8,4), (8,5)\n\nCurrent states: (6,3)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. All safe.\n\nSo these 0 cells are surrounded by safe cells, but their adjacent cells are already uncovered. Let's look for other 0 cells. Row 0, columns 0-2 are 0s. (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0. These are all 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe, which they are (all numbers).\n\nNow, let's look at row 8, column 3: 1. (8,3)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4), (9,2),\n(9,3), (9,4)\n\nBut since it's 9x9, row 9 is invalid. So valid cells: (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. So (8,3)=1 has adjacent cells (7,2)=2 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=0 (safe), (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1 (safe), (8,5)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine is (8,2). So (8,2) is a mine.\n\nEarlier, (7,1)=2 implies (8,1) and (8,2) are mines (since (7,1) has 2 mines in adjacent cells (8,1) and (8,2)), which matches (8,3)=1 having (8,2) as a mine. So (8,1) and (8,2) are mines.\n\nNow, let's find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look at row 1, column 8: '?'. If (1,8) is a mine (from (0,8)=1), then the cell (2,8) is adjacent to (1,8) (mine) and (2,7)=2. But (2,7)=2 has 2 mines, and if (1,8) is one, there's another mine in (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). So (2,8) might be a mine or not.\n\nAnother area: row 7, column 7 and 8 are '?'. Let's check (7,6)=1. (7,6) has adjacent cells (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?. (7,6)=1 means 1 mine in these. (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=1 are safe. So 1 mine in (6,7), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7).\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, all 0 cells are surrounded by numbers, so their adjacent cells are already uncovered. So the next best is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a number with known mines, indicating the '?' is safe.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (3,6)=1. (3,6)=1 has adjacent cells (3,7) and (4,7) as possible mines (since others are safe). If (3,7) is a mine, then (4,7) is safe. If (3,7) is safe, then (4,7) is a mine. But we don't know yet.\n\nRow 4, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (4,6)=1. (4,6)=1 has (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) as possible mines. If (4,7) is a mine, then (3,7) and (5,7) are safe. If not, one of them is a mine.\n\nRow 5, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (5,6)=1. (5,6)=1 has (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) as possible mines.\n\nRow 6, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (6,6)=1. (6,6)=1 has (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) as possible mines.\n\nRow 7, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (7,6)=1. (7,6)=1 has (6,7), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7) as possible mines.\n\nRow 8, column 6: '?'. Adjacent to (8,5)=1. (8,5)=1 has adjacent cells (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=?, (9,4)=invalid, (9,5)=invalid, (9,6)=invalid. So (8,5)=1 has (8,6) as a possible mine. Since (8,5)=1, if (8,6) is a mine, that's 1. So (8,6) could be a mine.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number where the number of adjacent flags plus the number of adjacent '?' equals the number. For example, if a cell has value 2, and there are 2 '?' adjacent, then those must be mines. But in our case, let's check:\n\nTake row 2, column 7: 2. (2,7)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. So (2,7)=2. The known safe cells are (1,6), (1,7), (2,6), (3,6). So 4 safe, 4 '?'. So 2 mines in 4 '?'. Not helpful.\n\nRow 7, column 2: 2. (7,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0, (7,1)=2, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1. (6,1), (6,2), (6,3) are 0s (safe). (7,1)=2 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (8,3)=1 (safe). So possible mines: (8,1), (8,2). Since (7,2)=2, these two must be mines. Which matches our earlier conclusion. So (8,1) and (8,2) are mines. So we can flag those, but the user might have already flagged some incorrect ones. But the current action is to uncover or flag\/unflag.\n\nBut the user's current flags are 3\/23, meaning 3 correct, 20 incorrect. So maybe some of the existing F's are incorrect. Let's check (2,3)=F. (2,3) is in row 2, column 3. Let's check (2,2)=1. (2,2)=1 has adjacent cells:\n\n(1,1)=0, (1,2)=1, (1,3)=2,\n(2,1)=0, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2,\n(3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2\n\nSo (2,2)=1. The adjacent cells: (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=1 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,1)=0 (safe), (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2 (safe), (3,1)=1 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So (2,2)=1 has 1 mine, which is (2,3)=F. That's correct. So (2,3) is a correct flag.\n\n(1,4)=F: (1,4) is in row 1, column 4. Check (1,3)=2. (1,3)=2 has adjacent cells (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=1, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=1, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=2. So (1,3)=2 has two F's, which are (1,4) and (2,3). So that's 2 mines, which matches (1,3)=2. So (1,4) is a correct flag.\n\n(4,2)=F: (4,2) is row 4, column 2. Check (4,1)=1. (4,1)=1 has adjacent cells (3,0)=0, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=1, (5,2)=1. So (4,1)=1 has 1 mine at (4,2)=F. Correct. So all 3 F's are correct. So the user has 3 correct flags, which is 3\/10, but the score is 3\/23, meaning they flagged 23 cells, 3 correct, 20 incorrect. So there are 20 F's that are not mines.\n\nLooking at the current board, the F's shown are only 3. The rest of the F's must be in the '?' areas. So the user has flagged 23 cells, 3 correct, 20 incorrect. So we need to unflag those incorrect ones, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet (Unflags: 0). But the current action could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look at row 8, column 7: '?'. What's adjacent to it? (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=?, (8,6)=?, (8,8)=?, (9,6)=invalid, etc. Not helpful.\n\nAnother area: row 1, column 8 is '?'. If (0,8)=1, then (1,8) is a mine (since (0,8) has adjacent cells (0,7)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?; 1 mine, so (1,8) is mine). So (1,8) is a mine. Then (2,8) is adjacent to (1,8) (mine). Let's check (2,8): adjacent cells are (1,7)=1, (1,8)=mine, (2,7)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. (2,8) is '?'. If (2,8) is safe, then (2,7)=2 has 1 mine (from (1,8)), so another mine in (3,7) or (3,8).\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (3,6)=1. (3,6)=1 has (3,7) and (4,7) as possible mines. If (3,7) is safe, then (4,7) is a mine. If (3,7) is a mine, then (4,7) is safe. But we don't know.\n\nWait, let's look at row 6, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (6,6)=1. (6,6)=1 has (5,7), (6,7), (7,7) as possible mines. If (6,7) is safe, then one of (5,7) or (7,7) is a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's consider row 8, column 4: 1. (8,4)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0,\n(8,3)=1, (8,5)=1, (9,3)=invalid,\n(9,4)=invalid, (9,5)=invalid.\n\nSo (8,4)=1 has adjacent cells (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=0 (safe), (7,5)=0 (safe), (8,3)=1 (safe), (8,5)=1 (safe). So no possible mines here. That can't be right. (8,4) is 1, so there must be 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list all 8 adjacent cells properly:\n\nRow 8, column 4 (8,4) has adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5), (9,3),\n(9,4), (9,5)\n\nBut since the grid is 9x9, rows 0-8 and columns 0-8, (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) are invalid. So valid adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5). All of these are numbers (1, 0, 0, 1, 1), which are safe. So (8,4)=1 must have 1 mine in those 5 cells, but they are all safe. That's a contradiction. This suggests that my initial parsing of the board is incorrect.\n\nAh, the original current board is probably not 9x9 but has more rows and columns. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, but the user might have pasted the board incorrectly, showing more cells. Let's re-express the current board correctly. The user wrote:\n\nCurrent Board:\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 1 2 F 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 1 F 2 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 1 2 2 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n1 2 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n1 ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nThis is 16 rows, each with 16 cells. But the problem says it's a 9x9 grid, so this must be a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to show a 9x9 grid but pasted it with extra rows and columns. Let's assume that the first 9 rows and 9 columns are the actual game board. So row 0 has columns 0-8: [0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1], row 1: [0,0,1,2,F,1,0,1,?], row 2: [0,0,1,F,2,1,1,2,?], row 3: [0,1,2,2,1,0,1,?,?], row 4: [0,1,F,1,0,0,1,?,?], row 5: [0,1,1,1,0,0,1,?,?], row 6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?], row 7: [1,2,2,1,0,0,1,?,?], row 8: [1,?,?,1,1,1,1,?,?]. That makes sense as a 9x9 grid.\n\nNow, let's focus on the '?' cells in this 9x9 grid. The '?' cells are in rows 1-8, columns 7-8, and row 8, columns 1-2.\n\nLet's list all '?' positions:\n\nRow 1, column 8: (1,8)\nRow 2, column 8: (2,8)\nRow 3, columns 7-8: (3,7), (3,8)\nRow 4, columns 7-8: (4,7), (4,8)\nRow 5, columns 7-8: (5,7), (5,8)\nRow 6, columns 7-8: (6,7), (6,8)\nRow 7, columns 7-8: (7,7), (7,8)\nRow 8, columns 1-2: (8,1), (8,2), and columns 7-8: (8,7), (8,8)\n\nNow, let's check row 8, column 0: 1. Its adjacent cells are (7,0)=1, (7,1)=2, (8,1)=?. (8,0)=1 means 1 mine in these three. (7,0)=1 is a number (safe), (7,1)=2 is a number (safe), so (8,1) must be a mine.\n\nRow 7, column 1: 2. Its adjacent cells are (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=1, (7,2)=2, (8,0)=1, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?. (7,1)=2 has 2 mines, which must be (8,1) and (8,2) (since the others are safe). So (8,1) and (8,2) are mines.\n\nRow 8, column 3: 1. Its adjacent cells are (7,2)=2, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=1. (8,3)=1 has 1 mine, which is (8,2) (since (7,2)=2 is a number, (7,3)=1 is a number, (7,4)=0 is a number, (8,4)=1 is a number, (8,5)=1 is a number). So (8,2) is a mine, which matches.\n\nSo (8,1) and (8,2) are confirmed mines. The user has 3 correct flags, but these two are mines not yet flagged (since the current F's are at (1,4), (2,3), (4,2)). So we should flag them, but the action could also be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nNow, let's find a safe cell. Let's look at row 1, column 8: (1,8). Adjacent to (0,8)=1. (0,8)=1 has adjacent cells (0,7)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?. (0,8)=1 means 1 mine in these three. (0,7)=1 and (1,7)=1 are numbers (safe), so (1,8) is a mine.\n\nRow 2, column 8: (2,8). Adjacent to (2,7)=2. (2,7)=2 has adjacent cells (1,6)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. (2,7)=2 needs 2 mines. We know (1,8) is a mine, so there's 1 more mine in (2,8), (3,7), (3,8).\n\nRow 3, column 6: 1. (3,6)=1 has adjacent cells (2,5)=1, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=2, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?. (3,6)=1 needs 1 mine, which is either (3,7) or (4,7).\n\nRow 4, column 6: 1. (4,6)=1 has adjacent cells (3,5)=0, (3,6)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=0, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?. (4,6)=1 needs 1 mine, which is in (3,7), (4,7), (5,7).\n\nRow 5, column 6: 1. (5,6)=1 has adjacent cells (4,5)=0, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. (5,6)=1 needs 1 mine in (4,7), (5,7), (6,7).\n\nRow 6, column 6: 1. (6,6)=1 has adjacent cells (5,5)=0, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (7,7)=?. (6,6)=1 needs 1 mine in (5,7), (6,7), (7,7).\n\nRow 7, column 6: 1. (7,6)=1 has adjacent cells (6,5)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=1, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?. (7,6)=1 needs 1 mine in (6,7), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7).\n\nRow 8, column 6: '?'. Adjacent to (8,5)=1. (8,5)=1 has adjacent cells (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?, (9,4)=invalid, (9,5)=invalid, (9,6)=invalid. So (8,5)=1 needs 1 mine in (8,6), (8,7).\n\nThis is quite a web. Let's look for a cell that has a 0 adjacent, which would mean all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 3, column 5: 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, as we saw earlier. The cell (3,5)=0 is at (3,5), so the cells around it are all uncovered. So no help.\n\nAnother 0 is row 4, column 4: 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 0. Same.\n\nRow 6, column 3: 0. Same.\n\nRow 7, column 4: 0. Same.\n\nRow 0, columns 0-2: 0s. Their adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nSo the only '?' cells are in the right and bottom parts of the grid. Let's pick a cell that is likely safe. Let's consider row 7, column 7: '?'. If (7,6)=1 has 1 mine in (6,7), (7,7), (8,6), (8,7), and if we assume that (8,6) and (8,7) are not mines (since (8,5)=1 has 1 mine in (8,6), (8,7)), then maybe (7,7) is safe. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number with the number of adjacent mines already satisfied. For example, row 2, column 3 is F (mine). (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3)=2, which has two mines (F's at (1,4) and (2,3)), so (1,3) is satisfied. (2,3) is also adjacent to (2,4)=2, which has two mines (F's at (1,4) and (2,3)), so (2,4) is satisfied. So those F's are correct.\n\nRow 4, column 2 is F (mine). (4,2) is adjacent to (4,1)=1, which has one mine (F), so satisfied. (4,2) is also adjacent to (3,2)=2, which has adjacent cells (2,1)=0, (2,2)=1, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=F, (4,3)=1. (3,2)=2 has two mines (F's at (2,3) and (4,2)), so that's satisfied.\n\nSo all existing F's are correct. The user has 3 correct flags, need 7 more. But the score is 3\/23, meaning 20 incorrect flags. So there are 20 F's in the '?' areas that are not mines. We need to unflag those, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet. However, the current action could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's pick a cell that is likely safe. Let's consider row 3, column 7: '?'. If (3,6)=1 has 1 mine, and if (4,7) is the mine, then (3,7) is safe. Let's assume that and uncover (3,7). Alternatively, row 4, column 7: '?'. If (3,7) is the mine, then (4,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 6, column 7: '?'. Adjacent to (6,6)=1. If (5,7) is the mine, then (6,7) is safe.\n\nBut maybe the safest bet is to uncover a cell in the bottom-right area where there are many '?'. Let's pick (3,7) as a candidate.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,7)","uncover (3,7)"],"unflags":0,"seed":0,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The board is 9x9, but the current board shown has 14 rows? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Oh, the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so probably the display here is a mistake, but I'll focus on the 9x9 part. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines. Since it's the start, the best first move is usually to uncover a corner or edge, which has a lower chance of being a mine. Let's pick (0,0) as the first move. So the action should be 'uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current board and see what's visible. The visible part is the top-left corner, rows 0 to 3, columns 0 to 3, and some in column 4. Let's list out the known cells:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ...]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ...]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ...]\nRow 3: [1, 1, 2, 2, ?, ...]\n\nSo columns 0-3, rows 0-3 are partially uncovered. Let's analyze the numbers to find possible mines.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 3 (cell (0,3)) which has a 1. This cell has 8 adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells for (0,3):\n\nAdjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). Wait, (0,3) is at the top edge, so row 0, column 3. The adjacent cells would be:\n\nTop: none (since row 0 is top), bottom: row 1, left: (0,2), right: (0,4). Then diagonally: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So total 5 adjacent cells. The value is 1, meaning exactly one of these 5 cells is a mine.\n\nLooking at (0,2) which is 0. A 0 means none of its adjacent cells are mines. Let's check (0,2) adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Since (0,2) is 0, all these cells are safe. So (0,3) is safe (it's already uncovered), (0,1) is 0 (uncovered), (1,1) is 0 (uncovered), (1,2) is 0 (uncovered), (1,3) is 2 (uncovered). So all adjacent to (0,2) are safe, which checks out.\n\nNow (1,3) has a 2. Let's find its adjacent cells. (1,3) is in row 1, column 3. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Let's list their current status:\n\n(0,2) is 0 (safe), (0,3) is 1 (safe), (1,2) is 0 (safe), (2,2) is 0 (safe), (2,3) is 2 (safe). So the unknown cells here are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). So (1,3) has a value of 2, meaning two of these three cells (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) are mines.\n\nNext, (2,3) has a 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Known cells: (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. So unknown cells are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). The value is 2, so two of these three cells are mines.\n\nNow, (3,3) has a 2. Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Known cells: (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,2)=2. So unknown cells: (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The value is 2, so two of these five are mines.\n\nLet's look at (1,3) and (2,3). (1,3) says two mines in (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). (2,3) says two mines in (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). Let's denote A=(0,4), B=(1,4), C=(2,4), D=(3,4). Then from (1,3): A + B + C = 2. From (2,3): B + C + D = 2. So if we subtract these equations: (A + B + C) - (B + C + D) = 0 → A - D = 0 → A = D. So (0,4) and (3,4) have the same number of mines (either both 0, 1, etc., but since each is a single cell, they are either both mines or both safe).\n\nNow let's check (0,3) which has a 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=A, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=B. So (0,3) has 1 mine in A and B (since the rest are safe). So A + B = 1.\n\nFrom (1,3): A + B + C = 2. Since A + B =1, then 1 + C =2 → C=1. So (2,4) must be a mine.\n\nSo C is a mine. Then from (1,3): A + B =1 (since C=1, 1 +1=2). From (2,3): B + C + D =2. Since C=1, B +1 + D=2 → B + D=1. But from (0,3), A + B=1. And earlier we found A=D. So substituting D=A into B + D=1: B + A=1, which matches A + B=1. So that's consistent.\n\nSo (2,4) is a mine (C=1). Now, let's check (3,2) which is 2. (3,2) is row 3, column 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Known cells: (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2. So unknown cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The value is 2, so two of these three are mines.\n\n(3,1) is 1. (3,1) adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Known cells: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2. So unknown cells: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). The value is 1, so one of these three is a mine.\n\n(3,0) is 1. (3,0) adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Known cells: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1. So unknown cells: (4,0), (4,1). The value is 1, so one of these two is a mine.\n\nSo (3,0)=1: (4,0) + (4,1) =1.\n\n(3,1)=1: (4,0) + (4,1) + (4,2) =1. But since (4,0)+(4,1)=1, then 1 + (4,2)=1 → (4,2)=0. So (4,2) is safe.\n\nThen (3,2)=2: (4,1) + (4,2) + (4,3) =2. Since (4,2)=0, then (4,1) + (4,3)=2. But (4,1) can be at most 1 (since (4,0)+(4,1)=1 from (3,0)), so (4,1)=1 and (4,3)=1. Therefore, (4,1) and (4,3) are mines, and (4,0)=0 (since (4,0)+(4,1)=1 → (4,0)=0).\n\nSo (4,0) is safe. Let's confirm: (3,0)=1's adjacent cells are (4,0) and (4,1). If (4,0) is safe, then (4,1) is the mine, which fits (3,0)=1. Then (3,1)=1's adjacent cells: (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0. So 0+1+0=1, which matches (3,1)=1. (3,2)=2's adjacent cells: (4,1)=1, (4,2)=0, (4,3)=1. 1+0+1=2, which matches. Good.\n\nNow, back to the original area. (2,4) is a mine (C=1). Let's see if we can find other safe cells. Let's look at (0,4)=A and (3,4)=D. Since A=D, and A + B=1 (from (0,3)=1), and B + D=1 (from (2,3)=2), which is same as B + A=1. So possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: A=1 (mine), then D=1 (mine), B=0 (safe). Then (0,4) and (3,4) are mines, (1,4) is safe.\n\nCase 2: A=0 (safe), then D=0 (safe), B=1 (mine). Then (1,4) is a mine, (0,4) and (3,4) are safe.\n\nWhich case is correct? Let's check (3,3)=2. (3,3) has adjacent cells (2,4)=C=1 (mine), (3,4)=D, (4,2)=0 (safe), (4,3)=1 (mine), (4,4). So (3,3)=2: the mines in adjacent cells are (2,4)=1, (4,3)=1, and possibly (3,4)=D and (4,4). So total mines adjacent to (3,3) should be 2. So 1 (from C) + 1 (from (4,3)) + D + (4,4) = 2. So D + (4,4) = 0. Therefore, D=0 and (4,4)=0. So D must be 0, which means A=0 (since A=D). Therefore, Case 2 is correct: A=0 (safe), D=0 (safe), B=1 (mine).\n\nSo (0,4) is safe, (1,4) is a mine, (2,4) is a mine, (3,4) is safe.\n\nLet's verify (3,3)=2. Adjacent mines: (2,4)=1, (4,3)=1. Total 2, which matches. Good. So (3,4) is safe. That's a cell we can uncover!\n\nSo the cell (3,4) is safe. Let's check the current board: row 3, column 4 is '?', so we can uncover it. That's the move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current board and understand what's visible. The board shown is a 9x9 grid, but the way it's presented here might be a bit off. Let me parse the given board correctly. Wait, the user wrote the current board as rows with numbers and question marks. Let's list the rows properly.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, that's 14 characters, but a 9x9 grid should have 9 columns. Maybe it's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Let's assume it's 9x9, so each row has 9 cells. Let's correct that. The initial rows might be:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: All ?\n\nSo the first four rows have some uncovered cells with numbers, and the rest are unknown (marked as ?). The numbers represent the count of adjacent mines. Let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0-3: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1.\n\nA 0 means no adjacent mines. So all eight surrounding cells of a 0 are safe. Let's check the 0s. For (0,0) which is 0, its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) is already 0, (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0. So those are safe. The 0s in (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are all 0s, which means their adjacent cells are safe. So the cells around these 0s are all safe.\n\nLooking at (0,3)=1. The adjacent cells to (0,3) are: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 0 (safe), (1,3) is 2. So the 1 at (0,3) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The possible cells are (0,4) and (1,4), since (0,2), (1,2) are safe (0), (1,3) is 2 (so it's a number, not a mine). So (0,3) has 1 mine in (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 2: (1,3)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=0 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (2,2)=0 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe). So the 2 at (1,3) has 2 mines in (0,4), (1,4), (2,4).\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 2: (2,3)=2. Adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2)=0 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,2)=0 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So the 2 at (2,3) has 2 mines in (1,4), (2,4), (3,4).\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 2: (3,3)=2. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=0 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe). So 2 mines in (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 4: (3,4)=4. Adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So 4 mines in (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nLet's try to connect these. Let's denote variables for possible mine positions. Let's use letters:\n\nLet a = (0,4), b = (1,4), c = (2,4), d = (3,4), e = (2,5), f = (3,5), g = (4,3), h = (4,4), i = (4,5).\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: a + b = 1 (since (0,3)'s adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=a, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=b. So 1 mine in a or b).\n\nFrom (1,3)=2: a + b + c = 2 (since (1,3)'s adjacent cells are (0,4)=a, (1,4)=b, (2,4)=c. The others are safe).\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: a + b = 1. Substitute into (1,3)=2: 1 + c = 2 → c=1. So (2,4) is a mine.\n\nNow c=1 (mine). Then (2,3)=2: (2,3)'s adjacent cells with possible mines are (1,4)=b, (2,4)=c=1, (3,4)=d. So 2 = b + c + d → 2 = b + 1 + d → b + d = 1.\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: a + b =1 → a=1 - b.\n\nNow (3,3)=2: (3,3) has adjacent cells (2,4)=c=1, (3,4)=d, (4,2), (4,3)=g, (4,4)=h. Wait, (3,3) is (row 3, column 3). Adjacent cells are:\n\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4 → (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=c=1.\n\nRow 3: columns 2,4 → (3,2)=2, (3,4)=d.\n\nRow 4: columns 2,3,4 → (4,2), (4,3)=g, (4,4)=h.\n\nSo the 2 at (3,3) counts mines in (2,4)=1, (3,4)=d, (4,2), (4,3)=g, (4,4)=h. So 2 = 1 + d + (mines in (4,2), g, h). Let's assume (4,2) is safe for now, maybe not, but let's focus on other cells first.\n\n(3,4)=4: adjacent cells are (2,3)=2, (2,4)=c=1, (2,5)=e, (3,3)=2, (3,5)=f, (4,3)=g, (4,4)=h, (4,5)=i. So 4 = 1 + e + f + g + h + i → e + f + g + h + i = 3.\n\nBut maybe let's look at (2,4)=c=1 (mine). So (2,4) is a mine, so we should flag it? Wait, but the current board's (2,4) is in row 2, column 4. Let's check the current board display. The initial rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 ? ... (columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,1; column 4 is ?)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 ? ... (column 4 is ?)\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ... (column 4 is ?)\nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ... (column 4 is 4)\n\nSo (2,4) is in row 2, column 4, which is a ?. Since we deduced it's a mine (c=1), we should flag it. But wait, let's confirm.\n\nFrom (1,3)=2: adjacent cells (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). (0,3)=1 says (0,4) + (1,4) = 1. So (1,3) has 2 mines, which must be (0,4)+(1,4)+(2,4) = 2. Since (0,4)+(1,4)=1, then (2,4)=1. So (2,4) is a mine. So that's a mine. So we should flag (2,4).\n\nBut wait, let's check (2,3)=2. (2,3) is row 2, column 3, which is 2. Its adjacent cells are (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=b, (2,2)=0, (2,4)=c=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=d. So the 2 mines here are (1,4) and (3,4), because (2,4)=1 is a mine. So 2 = b + 1 + d → b + d = 1. So either (1,4) is a mine and (3,4) is safe, or vice versa.\n\nBut (3,4) is 4. Let's see (3,4)=4. Its adjacent cells are (2,3)=2, (2,4)=1 (mine), (2,5)=e, (3,3)=2, (3,5)=f, (4,3)=g, (4,4)=h, (4,5)=i. So 4 mines in total. We already have 1 mine at (2,4), so the remaining 3 mines are in (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nIf (3,4) is a mine (d=1), then from b + d=1, b=0. So (1,4) is safe. Then (0,4)=a=1 - b=1, so (0,4) is a mine. So (0,4) would be a mine. Let's check (0,3)=1: (0,3) has adjacent (0,4)=1 (mine), (1,4)=0 (safe), so that's 1 mine, which matches. Then (1,3)=2: (0,4)=1, (1,4)=0, (2,4)=1 → 1+0+1=2, which matches. That works.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,4) is safe (d=0), then b=1. So (1,4)=1 (mine). Then (0,4)=a=1 - b=0 (safe). Then (0,3)=1: (0,4)=0, (1,4)=1 → 0+1=1, which matches. (1,3)=2: (0,4)=0, (1,4)=1, (2,4)=1 → 0+1+1=2, which also matches. So both possibilities are there. So (0,4) and (1,4) could be either one mine, and (2,4) is definitely a mine.\n\nSo (2,4) is a mine. Let's check the coordinates. The user's input uses (row, col), with (0,0) being top-left. So row 2, column 4 is (2,4). So we should flag (2,4). But wait, the current flags are 0\/19. The total mines are 10, so 19 might be a typo, maybe 10. Anyway, flagging a confirmed mine is good.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's a safe cell to uncover. The 0s in the top-left corner (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) have all their adjacent cells uncovered, since they are 0. So the cells around them are safe. For example, (0,0) is 0, so (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe, which they are (all 0s). The next cells adjacent to 0s: (0,2)=0, so (0,3) is 1 (already uncovered), (1,2)=0 (uncovered), (1,3)=2 (uncovered). So the 0s in the top-left have all adjacent cells uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0: (3,0)=1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The 1 at (3,0) means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Since (2,0-2) are 0, they are safe, (3,1)=1 is safe. So 1 mine in (4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nRow 3, column 1=1: adjacent cells (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. So 1 mine here. The unknowns are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Same as (3,0). So (3,0) and (3,1) both have 1 mine in (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). That suggests that exactly one of those three is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 2=2: adjacent cells (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. So 2 mines here. The known safe cells are (2,1), (2,2), (3,1). So 2 mines in (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) have 2 mines.\n\nBut from (3,0) and (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) have 1 mine. Let's denote j=(4,0), k=(4,1), l=(4,2), m=(4,3). So (3,0)=1: j + k + l =1. (3,1)=1: j + k + l=1 (same). (3,2)=2: k + l + m=2. So from j + k + l=1 and k + l + m=2, we can subtract: (k + l + m) - (j + k + l) = 2 -1 → m - j=1 → m=j+1. Since m and j are 0 or 1 (mines or not), j can be 0 → m=1; or j=1 → m=2 (impossible). So j=0, m=1. Therefore, (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,3)=1 (mine). Then from j=0, j + k + l=1 → k + l=1. So (4,1) and (4,2) have 1 mine between them.\n\nSo (4,0) is safe. That's a cell we can uncover! (4,0) is in row 4, column 0. The current board shows row 4 as all ?s, so (4,0) is ?. Since we deduced it's safe (j=0), we can uncover (4,0).\n\nThat's a safe move. Let's confirm: (3,0)=1, which has adjacent (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We found j=0, so (4,0) is safe. Uncovering (4,0) should reveal a number or 0.\n\nSo the best action is to uncover (4,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,0)","uncover (4,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the rows are listed as 0 to 14, which might be a typo. Wait, no, Minesweeper is typically 9x9, so maybe that's a formatting error. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nThe current board has some uncovered cells with numbers, which indicate the number of adjacent mines. Let's list the visible cells and their coordinates (assuming rows are 0-8 and columns 0-8, maybe the input has extra rows by mistake):\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [1, 1, 2, 2, 4, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 5-8: all ?\n\nFirst, let's analyze the known numbers. Let's consider the cells that are already uncovered and their adjacent cells.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0-3:\n\nRow 0, column 0 (0): All 8 adjacent cells (but since it's a corner, only 3: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) must have 0 mines. So those cells are safe. Indeed, row 0, column 1 is 0, row 1, column 0 is 0, row 1, column 1 is 0. That checks out.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (1): This cell has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). But (0,2) is 0 (from row 0, column 2 is 0), (1,2) is 0 (row 1, column 2 is 0), so the mine must be in one of (0,4), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nRow 1, column 3 (2): This cell has 2 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). We know (0,2)=0, (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0 (row 2, column 2 is 0), (0,3)=1 (already uncovered), so the adjacent mines are in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4). Since row 1, column 3's value is 2, there are 2 mines here.\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2): Adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Known values: (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2 (row 3, column 2 is 2), (3,3)=2 (row 3, column 3 is 2). So the adjacent mines are in (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4). Wait, (1,3) is 2 (row 1, column 3), which is uncovered, so it's a number, not a mine. So (1,3) is safe. So the adjacent cells for row 2, column 3 (value 2) are (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4). The value is 2, so 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (2): Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Known: (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (uncovered), (3,2)=2 (uncovered), so the adjacent mines are (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The value is 2, so 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 4 (4): This is the cell at (3,4), which is currently a '?', but wait, the input shows row 3 as \"1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ?\", so (3,4) is 4, meaning it's uncovered and shows 4. So (3,4) is a number 4, indicating 4 adjacent mines. Let's check its adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 2 (uncovered), (3,3) is 2 (uncovered), so the adjacent cells with possible mines are (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The value is 4, so 4 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (2): Adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Known: (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (uncovered), (3,1)=1 (row 3, column 1 is 1), (3,3)=2 (uncovered). So adjacent mines are (3,1) is 1 (which is a number, so safe), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The value is 2, so 2 mines in (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nRow 3, column 1 (1): Adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Known: (2,0)=0 (row 2, column 0 is 0), (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1 (row 3, column 0 is 1), (3,2)=2 (uncovered). So adjacent mines are (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). The value is 1, so 1 mine in these three.\n\nRow 3, column 0 (1): Adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Known: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1 (uncovered). So adjacent mines are (4,0), (4,1). The value is 1, so 1 mine here.\n\nRow 4, column 0 (1): Adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). Known: (3,0)=1 (uncovered), (3,1)=1 (uncovered). So adjacent mines are (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). The value is 1, so 1 mine here.\n\nLet's try to connect these. Let's start with row 3, column 0 (1). Its adjacent cells (4,0) and (4,1) have 1 mine. Row 3, column 1 (1) has adjacent cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) with 1 mine. Since (4,0) and (4,1) have 1 mine (from row 3, column 0), then (4,2) must be safe (because 1 mine in (4,0)\/(4,1) + 0 in (4,2) = 1 total for row 3, column 1). So (4,2) is safe. Then, row 3, column 2 (2) has adjacent cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) with 2 mines. Since (4,2) is safe, then (4,1) and (4,3) must be mines (2 mines). So (4,1) is a mine, (4,3) is a mine. Then, from row 3, column 0 (1), (4,0) and (4,1) have 1 mine. Since (4,1) is a mine, (4,0) must be safe. Then, row 3, column 1 (1) has (4,0) (safe), (4,1) (mine), (4,2) (safe) → 1 mine, which matches. Good.\n\nNow, (4,1) is a mine, (4,3) is a mine. Let's check row 4, column 0 (1). Its adjacent cells are (4,1) (mine), (5,0), (5,1). The value is 1, so there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. Since (4,1) is a mine, (5,0) and (5,1) must be safe (because 1 mine already, so no more). So (5,0) and (5,1) are safe.\n\nNext, row 3, column 3 (2) has adjacent cells (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Wait, row 3, column 3 is (3,3), value 2. Adjacent cells are (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (uncovered), (3,2)=2 (uncovered), so the remaining cells are (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). The value is 2, so 2 mines here. We know (4,3) is a mine (from earlier), so one mine is there. So there's 1 more mine in (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4). (4,2) is safe (from earlier), so (2,4), (3,4), (4,4) have 1 mine.\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2) has adjacent cells (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4). (3,3)=2 (uncovered), so adjacent cells are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). The value is 2, so 2 mines here. So (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) have 2 mines.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (2) has adjacent cells (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). The value is 2, so 2 mines here. So (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) have 2 mines.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (1) has adjacent cells (0,4), (1,3), (1,4). (1,3)=2 (uncovered), so adjacent cells are (0,4), (1,4). The value is 1, so 1 mine here. So (0,4) and (1,4) have 1 mine.\n\nLet's summarize:\n\nFrom row 0, column 3 (1): (0,4) + (1,4) = 1 mine.\n\nFrom row 1, column 3 (2): (0,4) + (1,4) + (2,4) = 2 mines. Since (0,4)+(1,4)=1, then (2,4)=1 mine.\n\nFrom row 2, column 3 (2): (1,4) + (2,4) + (3,4) = 2 mines. We know (2,4)=1, so (1,4) + (3,4) = 1 mine.\n\nFrom row 0, column 3 (1): (0,4) + (1,4) = 1. Let's say (1,4)=x, then (0,4)=1-x.\n\nFrom row 1, column 3 (2): (1-x) + x + 1 = 2 → 1-x + x +1=2 → 2=2. So that's consistent.\n\nFrom row 2, column 3 (2): x + 1 + (3,4) = 2 → x + (3,4) =1. So (3,4)=1 -x.\n\nNow, row 3, column 4 is 4 (value 4), which is uncovered. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=2 (uncovered), (3,3)=2 (uncovered), (4,3)=mine (from earlier). So the remaining cells are (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5). The value is 4, so 4 mines here. We know (2,4)=1 mine (from row 1, column 3), (4,3) is a mine but not in this list (wait, (4,3) is adjacent to (3,4) yes, (3,4) is (3,4), adjacent cells include (4,3). So (4,3) is a mine, which is part of the 4. So (2,4) (1 mine) + (4,3) (1 mine) + (2,5), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5) must sum to 4. So 1 + 1 + a + b + c + d =4 → a+b+c+d=2, where a=(2,5), b=(3,5), c=(4,4), d=(4,5).\n\nAlso, row 3, column 3 (2) has adjacent cells (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). (2,4)=1 mine, (3,4)=1-x (from earlier), (4,4)=c. The total for row 3, column 3 is 2 mines, so 1 + (1-x) + c =2 → 2 -x + c =2 → c =x.\n\nSo c=x.\n\nNow, let's look at row 4, column 3. We determined it's a mine. Let's check row 4, column 4 (which is c=x). If we can find x, we can know more.\n\nBut maybe instead of getting stuck here, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The goal is to uncover safe cells to reveal more numbers. The current board has many '?' cells, but some must be safe.\n\nFor example, row 4, column 2: we determined earlier that (4,2) is safe (from row 3, column 1 and 2 analysis). So (4,2) can be uncovered. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 3, column 1 (1) has adjacent cells (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We found (4,0) is safe, (4,1) is a mine, so (4,2) must be safe (since 1 mine total here). So uncovering (4,2) is safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 5, column 0 and row 5, column 1 (from row 4, column 0 analysis). Since (4,1) is a mine, row 4, column 0 (1) has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which is (4,1), so (5,0) and (5,1) are safe.\n\nSo possible actions: uncover (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), etc. Let's pick the most likely one. (4,2) is in row 4, which is adjacent to known numbers, so uncovering it might reveal a number that helps.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (4,2).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,2)","uncover (4,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the Current Board is shown with rows that have 15 elements each? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, right, the Minesweeper board is 9x9, so maybe the way it's displayed here is a mistake, but I should focus on the given data.\n\nThe input shows rows like \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which might be a typo, perhaps each row should have 9 cells. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells, and the extra question marks are a formatting error. Let's correct that. For example, the first row is \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ?\", the second \"0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\", third \"0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\", fourth \"1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ?\", fifth \"1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", and the rest are all \"?\".\n\nSo let's index the rows from 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Let's list the known cells:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4-8)=?\nRow 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4-8)=?\nRow 2: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4-8)=?\nRow 3: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=4, (3,5-8)=?\nRow 4: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?, (4,4-8)=?\nRows 5-8: all cells are ?\n\nNow, let's recall that a cell with a number indicates the count of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0-2 are 0s. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. So for (0,0)=0, the adjacent cells (which are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) are all 0, which makes sense. The 0 at (0,2) would have adjacent cells (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Since (0,2)=0, all those adjacent cells must be safe (no mines). But (0,3)=1, which is a number, so that's okay. (0,3)=1 means that among its 8 adjacent cells, there is 1 mine. The adjacent cells of (0,3) are:\n\n(0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nWe know (0,2)=0 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe, as it's a number). So the 1 mine in (0,3)'s neighbors must be either (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Known values: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2. So the 2 mines here must be in the remaining cells: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4).\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Known: (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. So the 2 mines here are in (1,4), (2,4), (3,4).\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 4. Let's look at its adjacent cells. (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nKnown cells: (2,3)=2, (3,3)=2. So the 4 mines here must be in (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). But 4 mines in total here.\n\nLet's try to connect these. Let's denote variables for possible mine positions:\n\nLet's let A = (0,4), B=(1,4), C=(2,4), D=(3,4), E=(2,5), F=(3,5), G=(4,3), H=(4,4), I=(4,5).\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: A + B = 1 (since (0,3) adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=A, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=B; others are (0,3) is at (0,3), so adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), but (0,3) is at row 0, so row-1 is invalid. So adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). So (0,3)=1 means exactly 1 mine in these 5 cells. But (0,2)=0 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe, as it's a number, not a mine). So the 1 mine must be in (0,4) or (1,4). So A + B = 1.\n\nFrom (1,3)=2: (1,3) adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Known: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1 (safe), (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (safe). So the 2 mines here are in (0,4)=A, (1,4)=B, (2,4)=C. So A + B + C = 2.\n\nFrom (2,3)=2: (2,3) adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Known: (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So the 2 mines here are in (1,4)=B, (2,4)=C, (3,4)=D. So B + C + D = 2.\n\nFrom (3,4)=4: (3,4) adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Known: (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So the 4 mines here are in (2,4)=C, (2,5)=E, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=G, (4,4)=H, (4,5)=I. So C + E + F + G + H + I = 4.\n\nNow, let's use the first three equations:\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: A + B = 1 --> A = 1 - B.\n\nFrom (1,3)=2: A + B + C = 2. Substitute A: (1 - B) + B + C = 2 --> 1 + C = 2 --> C = 1.\n\nSo C (which is (2,4)) is a mine. That's a key point. So (2,4) is a mine. Let's note that.\n\nThen, from (2,3)=2: B + C + D = 2. Since C=1, then B + 1 + D = 2 --> B + D = 1.\n\nFrom (0,3)=1: A = 1 - B. So A is 1 - B.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find more. Let's check row 3, column 2 is 2. (3,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Known: (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe). So (3,2)=2 means there are 2 mines in (3,1), (4,1), (4,3). Wait, (3,1)=1 is a number, so it's safe. So (3,1) is not a mine. So the adjacent cells for (3,2)=2 are:\n\n(2,1)=0 (safe), (2,2)=0 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,1)=1 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe), (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2 (safe), (4,3)=G.\n\nSo the 2 mines must be in (4,1) and (4,3). So (4,1) + G = 2. Since mines are either 0 or 1, this means both (4,1) and (4,3) are mines. So (4,1) is a mine (let's call it J), and (4,3)=G is a mine. So J=1, G=1.\n\nNow, row 4, column 0 is 1: (4,0)=1. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). Known: (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,1)=1 (safe), (4,1)=J=1 (mine). So (4,0)=1 means that among these adjacent cells, there is 1 mine. We already have (4,1) as a mine, so the other cells (5,0), (5,1) must be safe (since 1 mine is already accounted for). So (5,0) and (5,1) are safe. So we can uncover those.\n\nBut maybe that's a later step. Let's get back to (3,4)=4. We know C=1 (mine at (2,4)), and G=1 (mine at (4,3)). So C + G = 2. So the remaining 2 mines in (3,4)'s adjacent cells must be in E (2,5), F (3,5), H (4,4), I (4,5). So E + F + H + I = 2.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 3 is 2: (3,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Known: (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (safe), (2,4)=C=1 (mine), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,4)=4 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe), (4,3)=G=1 (mine). So the 2 mines here are (2,4) and (4,3), which sum to 2. That checks out, so (3,3)=2 is correct.\n\nRow 4, column 2 is 2: (4,2)=2. Adjacent cells are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). Known: (3,1)=1 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe), (4,1)=J=1 (mine), (4,3)=G=1 (mine). So (4,2)=2's adjacent mines are (4,1) and (4,3), which sum to 2. That's correct, so no new info here.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is 1: (3,1)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Known: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=J=1 (mine), (4,2)=2 (safe). So the 1 mine here is (4,1), which is correct. That checks out.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is 1: (3,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Known: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1 (safe), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=J=1 (mine). So the 1 mine here is (4,1), which is correct.\n\nRow 2, column 2 is 0: (2,2)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). All known cells here are 0 or numbers (safe), so no mines, which is correct.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 0: (1,2)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). All known, no mines, correct.\n\nRow 0, column 2 is 0: (0,2)=0. Adjacent cells (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). All known, no mines, correct.\n\nSo back to (2,4)=C=1 (mine). So (2,4) is a mine, so we should flag that. But wait, the current board's row 2, column 4 is a '?', so we can flag it. But let's confirm.\n\nWait, (2,3)=2's adjacent cells include (2,4)=C. Since we found C=1, that's a mine. So (2,4) is a mine. So the action could be to flag (2,4). But let's check other possibilities.\n\nAlso, (1,4)=B. From B + D = 1 (from (2,3)=2's equation). And A + B = 1 (from (0,3)=1). So A=1-B, D=1-B.\n\nNow, (1,3)=2's equation was A + B + C = 2. We had C=1, so A+B=1, which fits.\n\nWhat about (0,4)=A. If B=0, then A=1, D=1. If B=1, then A=0, D=0.\n\nLet's see if we can find which is the case. Let's check (1,4)=B. (1,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=1, (0,4)=A, (1,3)=2, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=C=1, (2,5)=E.\n\nIf B=0 (so (1,4) is safe), then A=1 (so (0,4) is a mine). Then D=1 (so (3,4) is a mine). Let's check (3,4)=4. (3,4) is adjacent to (2,4)=C=1 (mine), (4,3)=G=1 (mine). So if D=1 (mine at (3,4)), then (3,4) itself is a mine, but (3,4) is a cell that's currently shown as 4, which is a number. Wait, no: (3,4) in the current board is a 4, which means it's an uncovered cell with 4 adjacent mines. So (3,4) cannot be a mine, because mines are hidden and only uncovered if you step on them. So D (which is (3,4)) is an uncovered cell (value 4), so it's safe. Therefore, D cannot be a mine. So D=0. Therefore, from B + D =1, since D=0, B=1.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. (3,4) is already uncovered and shows 4, so it's a safe cell (not a mine). Therefore, D=0 (since D is (3,4), which is safe). So B + 0 =1 --> B=1. Then from A + B=1, A=0.\n\nSo:\n\nB=1 --> (1,4) is a mine.\n\nA=0 --> (0,4) is safe.\n\nD=0 --> (3,4) is safe (which it is, as it's uncovered).\n\nC=1 --> (2,4) is a mine.\n\nSo now we have two confirmed mines: (1,4) and (2,4).\n\nLet's verify (1,3)=2. (1,3) adjacent mines are A=0 (0,4), B=1 (1,4), C=1 (2,4). 0+1+1=2, which matches (1,3)=2. Correct.\n\n(0,3)=1: adjacent mines are A=0 (0,4), B=1 (1,4). 0+1=1, which matches. Correct.\n\n(2,3)=2: adjacent mines are B=1 (1,4), C=1 (2,4), D=0 (3,4). 1+1+0=2, which matches. Correct.\n\nGreat, so (1,4) and (2,4) are mines. So we should flag those.\n\nNow, let's check (0,4)=A=0, which is safe. So (0,4) can be uncovered. Let's confirm: (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=1, which has 1 mine (B=1 at (1,4)). So (0,4) is safe. Uncovering (0,4) would show the number of adjacent mines. Let's see what (0,4)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,4) is at row 0, column 4. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5)\n\nKnown: (0,3)=1 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=B=1 (mine). So the number of mines adjacent to (0,4) is 1 (from (1,4)). So (0,4) should show 1. Since it's currently '?', uncovering it is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4) is safe, so uncovering it is a good move. Let's see if there are other safe cells.\n\nRow 0, column 4 is (0,4), which we determined is safe. So uncovering (0,4) is a safe action.\n\nAnother safe cell: (0,5). Let's check (0,5). Its adjacent cells include (0,4)=A=0 (safe), (0,6), (1,4)=B=1 (mine), (1,5), (1,6). But we don't know (0,5)'s adjacent mines yet, but since (0,4) is safe, maybe (0,5) can be uncovered if it's safe. But perhaps (0,4) is a better first move since we can confirm it's safe.\n\nSo the best action is to uncover (0,4) since it's confirmed safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,4)","uncover (0,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to look at the current board and understand the revealed cells to make a safe move. \n\nThe board provided is a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed here is a bit confusing. Wait, the user probably pasted it with each row separated, but let me check the rows. The first row is \"0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – that's 13 characters, but Minesweeper is 9x9, so maybe there's a formatting error. Oh, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers represent the cells from (row, 0) to (row, 8). Let's correct that. Let's list the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 cells)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ?\nRow 4: 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 5-8: All ?\n\nSo the revealed area is from row 0 to row 4, columns 0 to 4 (since some cells in row 4, column 1 and 3 are ?). Let's focus on the known cells.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a cell with a number indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Cells with 0 mean no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 0-4: [0,0,0,1,1]. \n\nRow 0, column 0 (0,0) is 0. So all 8 adjacent cells (which would be (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) are safe. But (0,0) is a corner, so adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, those cells are safe. Indeed, (0,1) is 0, (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0 – that checks out.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). All of these are 0, which is correct.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0, (0,3) is 1, (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 0, (1,3) is 2. The 0 here means there are 0 mines adjacent, which matches because (0,3) is 1 (so (0,3) has 1 mine adjacent, but (0,2) is 0, so (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) and other cells).\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The count here is 1, so among these 5 cells, 1 is a mine.\n\nRow 0, column 4 (0,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). This also has 1 mine.\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All 0, correct.\n\nRow 1, column 1 (1,1) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). All 0, correct.\n\nRow 1, column 2 (1,2) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,3) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (2,3) is 2. So 0 here means no mines adjacent, which is correct.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). The count is 2, so 2 mines in these 8 cells.\n\nRow 1, column 4 (1,4) is ?. It's adjacent to (0,3) [1], (0,4) [1], (1,3) [2], (2,3) [2], (2,4) [?], (0,5) [?], (1,5) [?], (2,5) [?].\n\nRow 2, column 0 (2,0) is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). All 0 or 1, but since it's 0, no mines here. Correct.\n\nRow 2, column 1 (2,1) is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). All 0 or 1, correct.\n\nRow 2, column 2 (2,2) is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,3) is 2, (2,3) is 2, (3,3) is 2. 0 here is correct as no adjacent mines.\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). The count is 2, so 2 mines here.\n\nRow 2, column 4 (2,4) is ?. Adjacent to (1,3) [2], (1,4) [?], (2,3) [2], (3,3) [2], (3,4) [4], (1,5) [?], (2,5) [?], (3,5) [?].\n\nRow 3, column 0 (3,0) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) is 0, (2,1) is 0, (3,1) is 1, (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is ?. So 1 mine here. Since (3,0) is 1, one of its adjacent cells is a mine. The adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0) and (2,1) are 0, so they can't be mines. So the mine must be in (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1).\n\nRow 3, column 1 (3,1) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2. So 1 mine here. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (3,0) has 1, (3,2) is 2 (so maybe adjacent to mines), (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2. Since (3,1) is 1, one mine in its adjacent cells. The cells (2,0-2) are 0, so no mines there. So possible mines in (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But (3,0) is 1, which we already considered.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?. So 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (3,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=4, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. So 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 4 (3,4) is 4. Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=2, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. So 4 mines in these 8 cells. That's a high number, which might mean that (3,4) is surrounded by many mines. But since (3,4) is a 4, it's risky to uncover it, but maybe the user's current board shows (3,4) as 4, so it's already uncovered. Wait, looking back at the current board:\n\nThe user's current board is listed as:\n\n0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n... (more rows of ?)\n\nAh, so row 3, column 4 is 4 (already uncovered). So the 4 is a revealed cell, meaning it has 4 adjacent mines. So the adjacent cells to (3,4) (which are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5)) must contain 4 mines.\n\nNow, row 4, column 0 (4,0) is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 4, column 1 (4,1) is ?. Adjacent to (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=2, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?.\n\nRow 4, column 2 (4,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,3)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?. So 2 mines here.\n\nRow 4, column 3 (4,3) is ?. Adjacent to (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=4, (4,2)=2, (4,4)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?, (5,4)=?.\n\nSo, looking for safe cells to uncover. The safest cells are those adjacent to 0s, because 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe. Let's check where there are 0s and their adjacent ? cells.\n\nLooking at row 0, columns 0-2: all 0s. The adjacent cells to these 0s would be (0,3) which is 1, (0,4) which is 1, (1,3) which is 2, etc. But the 0s in row 0, columns 0-2 (cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)) have already had their adjacent cells (to the right and below) revealed. For example, (0,0) is 0, so (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe, which are all 0. (0,1) is 0, so (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are safe, which are 0. (0,2) is 0, so (0,3), (1,2), (1,3) are safe. (0,3) is 1 (safe, just a number), (1,2) is 0 (safe), (1,3) is 2 (safe). So the 0s in row 0,1,2 (columns 0-2) have their adjacent cells already uncovered, so no new ? cells there.\n\nNext, check other 0s. Row 1, columns 0-2: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0. Their adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) which are 0, and (0,0-2), (2,0-2), etc., all already revealed. So no ? cells there.\n\nRow 2, columns 0-2: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0. Adjacent cells are (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, which are already revealed. So no ? cells there.\n\nSo the 0s have all their adjacent cells uncovered. Now, look for cells with numbers and their adjacent ? cells that can be determined.\n\nLet's take (0,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=0, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?. So the 1 in (0,3) means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,2)=0 (safe), (0,4)=1 (safe, number), (1,2)=0 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe, number), and (1,4)=?. So the only unknown adjacent cell is (1,4). Since (0,3) has 1 mine adjacent, and the other adjacent cells are safe (since they are numbers, not mines), the mine must be in (1,4). Wait, no: numbers are safe cells (they are uncovered), so (0,4) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (1,3) is 2 (uncovered, safe). So the adjacent cells to (0,3) that are covered are only (1,4). So (0,3) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The covered cell is (1,4), so (1,4) must be a mine. Because all other adjacent cells are uncovered (and thus safe), so the mine must be (1,4). That's a possible flag.\n\nWait, let's confirm: (0,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,2): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n- (0,4): 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- (1,2): 0 (uncovered, safe)\n- (1,3): 2 (uncovered, safe)\n- (1,4): ? (covered)\n\nSo the 8 adjacent cells for (0,3) are those 5 (since (0,3) is on the top edge, row 0, so no row -1). Wait, in Minesweeper, each cell has up to 8 neighbors: up, down, left, right, and diagonals. So (0,3) is at row 0, column 3. Its neighbors are:\n\n(0-1,3-1) invalid (row -1)\n(0-1,3) invalid\n(0-1,3+1) invalid\n(0,3-1) = (0,2)\n(0,3+1) = (0,4)\n(0+1,3-1) = (1,2)\n(0+1,3) = (1,3)\n(0+1,3+1) = (1,4)\n\nSo exactly those 5 cells. All except (1,4) are uncovered and safe (since they are numbers, which are safe). So the 1 in (0,3) means exactly 1 mine in these 5 cells. Since the other 4 are safe, the mine must be in (1,4). Therefore, (1,4) is a mine. So we should flag (1,4).\n\nBut wait, let's check another cell to confirm. Let's take (0,4)=1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,3) = 1 (uncovered, safe)\n(0,5) = ? (covered)\n(1,3) = 2 (uncovered, safe)\n(1,4) = ? (covered)\n(1,5) = ? (covered)\n\nSo (0,4) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3) and (1,3) are uncovered (safe), so the mine is among (0,5), (1,4), (1,5). If we already concluded that (1,4) is a mine from (0,3)=1, then (0,4)=1's mine could be (1,4), which would mean that (0,4)'s 1 is satisfied by (1,4) being a mine. Then (0,5) and (1,5) would be safe. That's possible.\n\nAnother cell: (1,3)=2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2)=0 (safe)\n(0,3)=1 (safe)\n(0,4)=1 (safe)\n(1,2)=0 (safe)\n(1,4)=? (covered)\n(2,2)=0 (safe)\n(2,3)=2 (safe)\n(2,4)=? (covered)\n\nSo (1,3)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The covered cells are (1,4) and (2,4). From (0,3)=1, we think (1,4) is a mine. So (1,3)=2 would then need 1 more mine in its adjacent cells. The remaining covered cell is (2,4). So (2,4) would be a mine. Let's check (2,3)=2. (2,3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2)=0 (safe)\n(1,3)=2 (safe)\n(1,4)=? (covered)\n(2,2)=0 (safe)\n(2,4)=? (covered)\n(3,2)=2 (safe)\n(3,3)=2 (safe)\n(3,4)=4 (safe)\n\nSo (2,3)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The covered cells are (1,4) and (2,4). If (1,4) and (2,4) are both mines, that would make 2 mines, which matches (2,3)=2. That fits. So (1,4) and (2,4) are mines.\n\nThen (3,4)=4. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3)=2 (safe)\n(2,4)=? (covered, we think mine)\n(2,5)=? (covered)\n(3,3)=2 (safe)\n(3,5)=? (covered)\n(4,3)=? (covered)\n(4,4)=? (covered)\n(4,5)=? (covered)\n\nSo (3,4)=4 has 4 mines. We think (2,4) is a mine. Let's see how many others. Let's see (3,3)=2. (3,3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(2,2)=0 (safe)\n(2,3)=2 (safe)\n(2,4)=? (mine)\n(3,2)=2 (safe)\n(3,4)=4 (safe)\n(4,2)=2 (safe)\n(4,3)=? (covered)\n(4,4)=? (covered)\n\nSo (3,3)=2 has 2 mines. If (2,4) is a mine, then another mine must be in (4,3) or (4,4). Let's say (4,3) is a mine. Then (3,3)=2 is satisfied (2 mines: (2,4) and (4,3)).\n\nThen (3,4)=4 would have mines in (2,4), (4,3), and two more. Maybe (4,4) and (2,5)? Let's not get too deep. The key point is that (1,4) is a mine based on (0,3)=1. So we should flag (1,4).\n\nBut wait, the current flags are 0\/19. The user hasn't flagged any yet. So flagging (1,4) would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, are there any safe cells to uncover? Let's see. For example, (0,5) is adjacent to (0,4)=1. (0,4) has 1 mine, which we think is (1,4). So (0,5) is safe. Because (0,4)'s adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). We think (1,4) is the mine, so (0,5) and (1,5) are safe. So (0,5) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's confirm: (0,4)=1. The adjacent cells are (0,3)=1 (safe), (0,5)=? (covered), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=? (covered, mine), (1,5)=? (covered). Since (0,4) has 1 mine, and (1,4) is the mine, then (0,5) and (1,5) are safe. So uncovering (0,5) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, (1,5) is adjacent to (0,4)=1 and (1,4)=mine. If (1,4) is a mine, then (1,5) is adjacent to (0,4)=1 (which has 1 mine, already accounted for by (1,4)), so (1,5) is safe.\n\nSo (0,5) is a safe cell to uncover. Let's check the current board: row 0, column 5 is ?. So the action could be 'uncover (0,5)'.\n\nAlternatively, (1,5) is also safe, but (0,5) is in the first row, which is more revealed, so maybe easier.\n\nLet's verify with another angle. (0,3)=1: adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?. Since all except (1,4) are uncovered and safe, (1,4) must be a mine. Therefore, (0,4)=1's mine is (1,4), so (0,5) is safe. Therefore, uncovering (0,5) is safe.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the best move is to uncover (0,5).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,5)","uncover (0,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided a 14-row board, but wait, Minesweeper is usually 9x9. Maybe there's a formatting issue. Let me check again. Oh, the initial description says it's a 9x9 grid, so perhaps the current board is displayed with rows separated by spaces? Let me parse the current board correctly.\n\nLooking at the Current Board:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? \nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ? \nRow 4: 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 5: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 6: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 7: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 8: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? \n\nWait, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers are the cells. Let's count the columns. The first row has 9 elements: 0,0,0,1,1,1,?,?,? — that's 9. So rows 0-8, each with 9 columns (0-8). The initial input might have been split into lines, but it's a 9x9 grid.\n\nNow, the goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. The score is correct flags \/ 10, so we need to flag all 10 mines correctly to win. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLet's analyze the known cells. Let's start with row 0, column 0-5 are uncovered and show 0,0,0,1,1,1. A 0 means no adjacent mines, so all 8 surrounding cells are safe. Let's check the 0s.\n\nRow 0, column 0 (0,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, these cells are safe. But (0,1) is 0, (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0 — so those are already uncovered and safe.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 0. Adjacent cells include (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). All these are 0, which are safe.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0, (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 0. (0,3) is 1, (1,3) is 2. So 0,3 is 1, which means there's 1 mine around it.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3) is 1. Let's list its adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 0, (1,2) is 0, (1,3) is 2. So the 1 in (0,3) means exactly 1 mine in the adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nRow 0, column 4 (0,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3) is 1, (1,3) is 2. So 1 mine in (0,5), (1,4), (1,5).\n\nRow 0, column 5 (0,5) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 1, (1,4) is ?, (1,5) is ?, (1,6) is ?. So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0) is 0. Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All 0s, safe.\n\nRow 1, column 1 (1,1) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). All 0s, safe.\n\nRow 1, column 2 (1,2) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0. (0,3)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,3)=2. So 0 here, so no mines around, which is consistent.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2. So the 2 here means 2 mines in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=4. So 2 mines here, possibly overlapping with (1,3)'s 2.\n\nRow 3, column 0 (3,0) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?. So 1 mine in (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). But (4,0) is 1, so let's check (4,0).\n\nRow 4, column 0 (4,0) is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0)=1, (3,1)=?, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. So 1 mine here.\n\nRow 3, column 1 (3,1) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,2)=2. So 1 mine in (3,2's adjacent?), maybe (4,1).\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=1, (3,3)=2, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?. So 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (3,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,2)=2, (4,2)=2, (3,4)=4. So 2 mines here.\n\nRow 3, column 4 (3,4) is 4. That's a high number. Let's see its adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. The 4 here means 4 mines in these 8 cells. Since (2,3) is 2, which has adjacent cells including (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), etc. Maybe (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) have 4 mines.\n\nLooking for safe cells. Let's check row 0, column 6. It's '?'. What's adjacent to (0,6)? The cell (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells of (0,5) are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 1, which is a number, so not a mine. So (0,5)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). So one of these is a mine. But (0,6) is adjacent to (0,5) and (1,5), (1,6). If (0,6) is a mine, then (0,5) would count it. But maybe there's a better cell to uncover.\n\nAnother area: row 1, column 2 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all uncovered and safe, so the cells around it are safe. The 0s in rows 0-2, columns 0-2 mean that all cells from (0,0) to (2,2) are safe and their adjacent cells are safe. So the area (0,0)-(2,2) is all safe and uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 3 (0,3)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?. So the 1 here must be from (1,4). Because (0,3) has 5 adjacent cells: (0,2) (safe), (0,4) (1, which is a number, so not a mine), (1,2) (safe), (1,3) (2, number), (1,4) (unknown). Wait, 8 adjacent cells: (0,3) is at (row 0, column 3). Adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), but row can't be -1. So (0,3)'s adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,4),\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nSo 5 cells. (0,2)=0 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (0,4)=1 (number, so not a mine), (1,3)=2 (number, not a mine). So the only possible mine adjacent to (0,3) is (1,4). Because (0,3) is 1, there must be 1 mine in those 5 cells. Since (0,2), (1,2), (0,4), (1,3) are all safe (non-mine), then (1,4) must be a mine!\n\nYes! Because (0,3) has 1 mine adjacent. The adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). All except (1,4) are already uncovered and are numbers (not mines). So (1,4) must be a mine. So we can flag (1,4).\n\nWait, let's confirm. (0,3) is 1, which counts the number of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\nTop-left: (0-1,3-1) invalid, so (0,2), (0,4),\n\nLeft: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nSo 5 cells. (0,2) is 0 (safe, not a mine), (0,4) is 1 (safe, not a mine), (1,2) is 0 (safe, not a mine), (1,3) is 2 (safe, not a mine). So the only possible mine is (1,4). Therefore, (1,4) must be a mine. So we should flag (1,4).\n\nLet me check another cell. Let's take (1,3)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2. So the 2 mines must be in (1,4) and (2,4). Because (0,3)=1's mine is (1,4), so (1,3)=2 has two mines: (1,4) and (2,4). So (2,4) is also a mine.\n\nThen (2,3)=2. Its adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=0, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2. The mines here would be (1,4) and (2,4), which are already 2 mines, so that's consistent with (2,3)=2.\n\nThen (3,4)=4. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=2 (safe), (2,4)=mine, (3,3)=2 (safe), so the 4 mines would be (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) — but (2,4) is a mine, so that's one. So (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) need to have 3 more mines to make 4 total.\n\nBut maybe let's focus on the first conclusion: (1,4) is a mine. So the action should be to flag (1,4). Let's check the current Flags: 0\/19 (probably a typo, total mines are 10). So flagging (1,4) would increase correct flags if it's a mine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's see row 4, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. (3,0)=1's adjacent cells are (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?. So (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (4,0)=1 has 1 mine in (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). If (3,1) is a mine, then (3,0)=1 would have that as the mine, and (4,0)=1 would have (3,1) as a mine, so (4,0)=1's mine is (3,1), meaning (4,1), (5,0), (5,1) are safe. But (3,1) is 1, which is a number, so it's not a mine. Wait, (3,1) is 1, which is a number, so it's a safe cell that shows the count. So (3,1) is not a mine. So (3,0)=1's mine must be in (4,0) or (4,1). (4,0) is 1, which is a number, so not a mine. Therefore, (4,1) must be the mine for (3,0)=1. Then (4,0)=1's mine is (4,1), so (5,0) and (5,1) are safe. So (5,0) and (5,1) can be uncovered safely.\n\nBut let's go back to (1,4). Since (0,3)=1's adjacent cells are all safe except (1,4), that must be a mine. So the best action is to flag (1,4).\n\nAnswer: flag (1,4)","flag (1,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user mentioned it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 15 rows? Maybe that's a typo, but I'll focus on the visible cells.\n\nThe input format includes actions like uncover, flag, or unflag. The goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags over total mines (10), so we need to flag as many correct mines as possible.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Let's index rows starting at 0. Let's list the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ... (assuming the rest are ?)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 F ? ... (F at (1,4))\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ...\nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ? ... (cell (3,4) is 4)\nRow 4: 1 ? 2 ? ... (cell (4,1) is ?, (4,2) is 2)\nRows 5-14: all ?\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Let's check cells with numbers to find possible mines.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 3 (0,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=0, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=F. The 1 at (0,3) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,2)=0 (safe), (0,4)=1 (safe), (1,2)=0 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=F (flagged). So the 1 at (0,3) has only (1,4) as adjacent, which is flagged. So (1,4) could be a mine. Since the 1's count is 1, that F is correct.\n\nRow 0, column 4 (0,4) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=1, (0,5)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=?. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells: (0,3) and (0,5) are numbers (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=F (possible mine), (1,5)=?. So if (1,4) is a mine, then (0,4)'s 1 is satisfied. So (1,4) is likely a correct flag.\n\nRow 0, column 5 (0,5) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,4)=1, (0,6)=?, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent. (0,4) is safe, (1,4) is F (mine). So that's 1 mine, so (0,5)'s 1 is satisfied. So (1,4) is correct.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,4)=F, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent. Let's count possible mines: (1,4)=F (mine) and (2,4)=? (maybe mine). Because the other adjacent cells are 0s or 1s (safe). So (1,3) has 2, so if (1,4) is a mine, then (2,4) must be a mine to make 2. So (2,4) is a possible mine.\n\nRow 2, column 3 (2,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=F, (2,2)=0, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=4. The 2 here: adjacent cells (1,4)=F (mine) and (2,4)=? (possible mine). So 2 mines, so (2,4) is a mine. That aligns with row 1, column 3's 2 needing two mines. So (2,4) is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (3,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=4, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 2 here: need 2 mines. Let's see (2,4) is a mine (from above), so maybe (4,3) or (4,4) is a mine?\n\nRow 3, column 4 (3,4) is 4. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=2, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. The 4 here means 4 mines in adjacent. Let's count possible mines. From earlier, (2,4) is a mine (from row 1,3 and row 2,3). Let's see:\n\nAdjacent cells to (3,4):\n\n(2,3) is 2 (safe), (2,4) is ? (mine), (2,5) is ?, (3,3)=2 (safe), (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?.\n\nSo (2,4) is a mine (1), then we need 3 more mines in the remaining adjacent cells: (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nRow 4, column 2 (4,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,3)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?. The 2 here: need 2 mines. Adjacent cells (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe). So (3,1), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) have 2 mines.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=2, (4,3)=?. The 2 here: adjacent cells (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,3)=2 (safe), (4,2)=2 (safe). So the possible mines are (3,1), (4,1), (4,3). So 2 mines in these three cells.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is flagged (F). The score says Flags: 1\/19, which is 1 flagged, 19 total (but there are 10 mines). So that F might be correct, but the user has only 1 flag.\n\nThe goal is to either uncover safe cells or flag mines. Since the game ends at 100 epochs or uncovering a mine, we need to make safe moves.\n\nLooking for cells that are safe to uncover. Let's check cells with 0s. For example, row 0, column 0-2 are 0s. 0 means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe. So any cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. All 0s, so no mines around. So cells adjacent to 0s can be uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 0: adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are all 0, so their adjacent cells are also safe.\n\nRow 1, column 0-2: 0,0,0. So (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are 0. Their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are 0 (row 2, columns 0-2 are 0,0,0). So these 0s form a large safe area. The cells adjacent to these 0s are safe, so we can uncover cells in this area that are still ?.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6: it's a ?. Let's see if it's adjacent to a 0. (0,5)=1. 1 means 1 mine adjacent. (0,5)'s adjacent cells are (0,4)=1, (0,6)=?, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?. Since (0,5) is 1, and (1,4) is F (mine), that's 1 mine, so (0,6) and (1,5), (1,6) are safe. So (0,6) can be uncovered safely.\n\nWait, (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\nTop: (0,4) (1, safe)\nTop-right: (0,6) (?)\nLeft: (0,4) (already considered)\nRight: (0,6)\nBottom-left: (1,4) (F, mine)\nBottom: (1,5) (?)\nBottom-right: (1,6) (?)\n\nSo (0,5) has 1 mine, which is (1,4). So the other adjacent cells (0,6), (1,5), (1,6) are safe. So uncovering (0,6) is safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 0, column 6. Let's confirm. Since (0,5) is 1, and (1,4) is a mine (F), that's the only mine adjacent to (0,5). So (0,6) has no mine, so it's safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 5: (1,5) is adjacent to (0,5)=1. Since (0,5) has 1 mine (F at (1,4)), (1,5) is safe. So (1,5) can be uncovered.\n\nBut let's check other 0 cells. For example, row 2, column 0-2 are 0,0,0. So (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are 0. Their adjacent cells are safe. So (3,0) is 1 (row 3, column 0 is 1). Let's check (3,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent. The adjacent cells (2,0) and (2,1) are 0 (safe), so the mine must be in (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1). But (3,0)=1, so only 1 mine in those three. Maybe (4,0)=1 is a number, so (4,0) is safe. So (3,1) or (4,1) could be the mine. But maybe not relevant for now.\n\nThe safest moves are to uncover cells that are adjacent to 0s or to numbers that have their mine count already satisfied, meaning the ? cells are safe.\n\nLooking back, (0,6) is adjacent to (0,5)=1, which has its mine count satisfied by (1,4)=F. So (0,6) is safe. Let's pick that.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 5 is adjacent to (1,3)=2. (1,3)=2 has (1,4)=F (mine) and (2,4)=? (mine). So (1,3) needs 2 mines. If (2,4) is a mine, then (1,3)'s 2 is satisfied. So (1,5) is adjacent to (1,3)=2. (1,5) is not adjacent to (1,4) or (2,4), so (1,5) is safe.\n\nAnother possible safe cell: row 0, column 6. Let's go with that. So the action would be 'uncover (0,6)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,6)","uncover (0,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows more rows and columns. Wait, maybe the current board is a partial view? Let me check the given board.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 F ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 4: 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 5-14: All ?\n\nHmm, maybe the board is actually 15x15? The problem statement said 9x9, but perhaps the input here is a typo. Or maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nFirst, the flags: there's one F at (1,4). The score is 1\/19, which is 0.0526, but total mines are 10, so maybe the Flags count is 1 correct out of 19 attempted? The problem statement says the final score is correct flags \/ total mines, so 1 correct so far.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or uncovering a mine.\n\nLet's analyze the known cells. Let's list the coordinates as (row, column), starting from (0,0) at top-left.\n\nRow 0: columns 0-6 are 0,0,0,1,1,1,1. Then columns 7-13 are ?.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,2. Column 4 is F (flagged). Columns 5-13 are ?.\n\nRow 2: columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,2. Columns 4-13 are ?.\n\nRow 3: columns 0-4 are 1,1,2,2,4. Columns 5-13 are ?.\n\nRow 4: column 0 is 1, column 1 is ?, column 2 is 2, column 3 is ?, columns 4-13 are ?.\n\nLet's look for clues. Let's start with the 0s, which mean no adjacent mines. So any cell adjacent to a 0 is safe.\n\nRow 0, column 0: 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are 0 in their respective rows, which makes sense. So those are safe.\n\nRow 1, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All are 0, so safe.\n\nNow, row 1, column 3 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. The 2 at (1,3) (row 1, column 3) has adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). Let's list their current states:\n\n(0,2) is 0 (row 0, column 2: 0), (0,3) is 1 (row 0, column 3: 1), (0,4) is 1 (row 0, column 4: 1), (1,2) is 0 (row 1, column 2: 0), (1,4) is F (flagged), (2,2) is 0 (row 2, column 2: 0), (2,3) is 2 (row 2, column 3: 2), (2,4) is ? (row 2, column 4: ?).\n\nThe 2 at (1,3) indicates there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. Let's count known mines: (1,4) is flagged. If that's a correct flag, then there's 1 mine accounted for. So there should be 1 more mine in the adjacent cells.\n\nAdjacent cells that are not 0 (since 0s can't be mines): (0,3) is 1, (0,4) is 1, (2,3) is 2, (2,4) is ?. Wait, 0s are safe, so cells with 0 are uncovered and safe, so their adjacent cells are known. The 2 at (1,3) is an uncovered cell showing the number of adjacent mines. So the adjacent cells to (1,3) that are still covered (?) or flagged (F) could be mines.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (1,3) are:\n\n(0,2) is 0 (safe, not a mine), (0,3) is 1 (uncovered, not a mine), (0,4) is 1 (uncovered, not a mine), (1,2) is 0 (safe, not a mine), (1,4) is F (flagged, possible mine), (2,2) is 0 (safe, not a mine), (2,3) is 2 (uncovered, not a mine), (2,4) is ? (covered, possible mine).\n\nSo the only possible cells that could be mines are (1,4) (flagged) and (2,4) (covered). Since the 2 at (1,3) says there are 2 mines adjacent, and (1,4) is flagged (assuming it's correct), then (2,4) must also be a mine. But wait, that's 2 mines: (1,4) and (2,4). So that would satisfy the 2.\n\nBut let's check another cell. The 2 at (2,3) (row 2, column 3). Let's find its adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2) = 0 (safe), (1,3) = 2 (uncovered), (1,4) = F (flagged), (2,2) = 0 (safe), (2,4) = ? (covered), (3,2) = 2 (uncovered), (3,3) = 2 (uncovered), (3,4) = 4 (uncovered).\n\nSo adjacent cells for (2,3) are: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). Among these, the covered cells are (2,4) and the flagged (1,4). The 2 at (2,3) means there are 2 mines adjacent. If (1,4) is a mine (flagged correctly) and (2,4) is a mine, then that's 2, which matches the 2 at (2,3). That seems consistent.\n\nNow, row 3, column 4 is 4. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,4) has adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3) = 2, (2,4) = ?, (2,5) = ?, (3,3) = 2, (3,5) = ?, (4,3) = ?, (4,4) = ?, (4,5) = ?.\n\nThe 4 here means there are 4 mines in those 8 cells. Let's see which of these are already known. (2,3) and (3,3) are uncovered (not mines). So the possible mine cells are (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). If (2,4) is a mine (from earlier), then we need 3 more mines in the remaining 5 cells.\n\nAnother cell: row 0, column 6 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (0,6) is 1. Wait, (0,6) is 1, so adjacent mines: 1. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=1 (uncovered), (0,7)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (0,6) is 1. So (0,6) is surrounded by (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (0,6) is 1. The 1 at (0,6) indicates 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,5) is 1 (uncovered, not a mine), so the mine must be in (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), or (1,7).\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 2, which we thought has (1,4) and (2,4) as mines. Let's assume (1,4) is a correct flag (since the score is 1\/10, maybe that's the one correct flag). So (1,4) is a mine. Then (2,4) must be a mine (from the 2 at (1,3) and (2,3)).\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 4. If (2,4) is a mine, then the 4 needs 3 more mines in its adjacent cells. Let's look at row 4, column 2 is 2. (4,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells: (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,3)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?.\n\nThe 2 at (4,2) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (3,1)=1 (uncovered), (3,2)=2 (uncovered), (3,3)=2 (uncovered) are not mines. So possible mines in (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\nRow 4, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. The 1 at (4,0) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,0)=1 and (3,1)=1 are uncovered, so the mine is in (4,1), (5,0), or (5,1).\n\nPutting this together, maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that's definitely safe. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 0, columns 0-2 are 0s. Their adjacent cells are all uncovered and safe. So any cell adjacent to a 0 is safe. Let's check row 0, column 6 is 1. The cell (0,6) is 1, so adjacent to it, (0,5) is 1 (uncovered), (1,5) is ?. If (0,6) is 1, and (0,5) is 1 (which is an uncovered cell showing 1), then (0,5) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Let's check (0,5)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=1, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=F, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (0,5) is 1. So (0,5) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,4)=1 (uncovered), (0,6)=1 (uncovered), (1,4)=F (flagged mine). If (1,4) is a mine, then that's 1 mine, so (0,5) is correct. So (1,5) would be safe? Because (0,5) is 1, and (1,4) is a mine, so no other mines adjacent to (0,5). Therefore, (1,5) is safe. So uncovering (1,5) would be safe.\n\nLet me confirm. (0,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,4) = 1 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(0,6) = 1 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(1,4) = F (flagged, assumed mine)\n\n(1,5) = ? (covered)\n\n(1,6) = ? (covered)\n\n(0,5) itself is 1, so the count is 1 mine. Since (1,4) is a mine (flagged), that's 1, so (1,5) and (1,6) must be safe. So (1,5) is safe to uncover.\n\nAnother possible safe cell: row 2, column 3 is 2. Its adjacent cells include (2,4)=? (which we think is a mine). If (2,4) is a mine, then (2,5) might be safe? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, row 3, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0)=0, (2,1)=0, (3,1)=1, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=?, (2,0) and (2,1) are 0s, so safe. So (3,0) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (2,0) (safe), (2,1) (safe), (3,1)=1 (uncovered), (4,0)=1 (uncovered), (4,1)=? (covered), (2,-1) (invalid), (3,-1) (invalid), (4,-1) (invalid). So only (4,1) is a possible adjacent cell. So (4,1) must be a mine? Because (3,0) is 1, and the only possible adjacent cell is (4,1). Wait, (3,0) is at (row 3, column 0). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row 2, column 0): 0 (safe)\n\n(row 2, column 1): 0 (safe)\n\n(row 3, column 1): 1 (uncovered)\n\n(row 4, column 0): 1 (uncovered)\n\n(row 4, column 1): ? (covered)\n\nAlso, (row 2, column -1) and (row 3, column -1) and (row 4, column -1) are out of bounds. So the valid adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). Among these, (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0) are all uncovered and not mines. So the only possible mine is (4,1). Therefore, (4,1) must be a mine. So (4,1) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag it. But the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag.\n\nWait, but the user hasn't flagged (4,1) yet. But maybe we can confirm that (4,1) is a mine. Let's check row 4, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. The 1 at (4,0) means 1 mine in these adjacent cells. (3,0) and (3,1) are uncovered (not mines). So the mine must be in (4,1), (5,0), or (5,1). But from (3,0)=1, which we determined that (4,1) is a mine. So (4,1) is a mine. Therefore, (4,1) should be flagged. But the current flags are 1, and maybe that's the correct one. But maybe the user's flag at (1,4) is incorrect. Because if (1,4) is not a mine, then our earlier reasoning is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the 4 at (3,4). (3,4) is 4. Let's list all adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3)=2 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(2,4)=? (covered)\n\n(2,5)=? (covered)\n\n(3,3)=2 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(3,5)=? (covered)\n\n(4,3)=? (covered)\n\n(4,4)=? (covered)\n\n(4,5)=? (covered)\n\nSo 8 cells, 4 of which are mines. Let's say (2,4) is a mine (from (1,3)=2 and (2,3)=2), then we need 3 more mines in (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 2. Let's check (3,3)=2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,2)=0 (safe)\n\n(2,3)=2 (uncovered)\n\n(2,4)=? (covered)\n\n(3,2)=2 (uncovered)\n\n(3,4)=4 (uncovered)\n\n(4,2)=2 (uncovered)\n\n(4,3)=? (covered)\n\n(4,4)=? (covered)\n\nSo (3,3)=2 has adjacent cells. The 2 means 2 mines here. (2,2) and (3,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,2) are uncovered (not mines). So the possible mines are (2,4), (4,3), (4,4). If (2,4) is a mine, then (4,3) or (4,4) must be 1 more mine. So (3,3)=2 would have 2 mines: (2,4) and one of (4,3)\/(4,4). That fits.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's definitely safe. Let's go back to (1,5). From (0,5)=1, which has adjacent cells (1,4)=F (flagged mine). If (1,4) is a correct flag (mine), then (0,5)=1's adjacent mine count is satisfied, so (1,5) is safe. Therefore, uncovering (1,5) is safe.\n\nLet's verify again. (0,5) is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,4) = 1 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(0,6) = 1 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\n(1,4) = F (flagged, assumed mine)\n\n(1,5) = ? (covered)\n\n(1,6) = ? (covered)\n\n(0,5) itself is 1, so the number of adjacent mines is 1. Since (1,4) is a mine (flagged), that's 1 mine. Therefore, (1,5) and (1,6) cannot be mines (since 1 mine already accounted for). Therefore, (1,5) is safe to uncover. So the action should be to uncover (1,5).\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,5)","uncover (1,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user provided a 14-row board, but Minesweeper is typically 9x9, maybe it's a typo. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nThe board has some numbers and a flagged cell (F at (1,4)). The score is 0.05, which is 1\/19, so they have 1 correct flag out of 10 mines. The goal is to either flag all 10 or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (columns 0-6 are uncovered, 7+ are ?)\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 F 3 ? ? ... (column 4 is F)\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 ? ... \nRow 3: 1 1 2 2 4 ? ... \nRow 4: 1 ? 2 ? ... \n\nLet's check the F at (1,4). The cell (1,4) is flagged. Let's see the adjacent numbers to verify if it's a correct flag. The cell (1,3) is 2. The cell (1,3) (row 1, column 3) has a value of 2, meaning it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (1,3) are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). \n\nFrom row 0, column 3 is 1 (uncovered), column 4 is 1 (uncovered). Row 1, column 2 is 0 (uncovered). Row 2, column 2 is 0 (uncovered), column 3 is 2 (uncovered). So the adjacent cells to (1,3) that are unknown are (0,4) (row 0, column 4 is 1, which is a number, so already uncovered), wait no: (1,3) is column 3, row 1. So adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4) → row 0, columns 2,3,4. Row 0, column 2 is 0 (uncovered), column 3 is 1 (uncovered), column 4 is 1 (uncovered). \n\n(1,2) is 0 (uncovered), (1,4) is F (flagged). \n\n(2,2) is 0 (uncovered), (2,3) is 2 (uncovered), (2,4) is ? (unknown). \n\nSo the adjacent cells to (1,3) that are either flagged or unknown: (1,4) is F, (2,4) is ?. The number at (1,3) is 2, which means there should be 2 mines in those 8 cells. The uncovered cells (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) are all safe (since they are numbers or 0s), so the mines must be in (1,4) and (2,4). So if (1,4) is flagged, then (2,4) should also be a mine. But (1,4) is flagged as F, so if that's a mine, then (2,4) is another mine. But let's check the cell (1,5) which is 3. (1,5) is row 1, column 5, value 3. Its adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). \n\nRow 0, column 4 is 1 (uncovered), column 5 is 1 (uncovered), column 6 is 1 (uncovered). (1,4) is F, (1,6) is ?. (2,4) is ?, (2,5) is ?, (2,6) is ?. The number at (1,5) is 3. The known safe cells here are (0,4), (0,5), (0,6) (since they are uncovered numbers). So the possible mines are (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). Since (1,4) is flagged (assuming it's a mine), then (1,5) needs 3 mines. If (1,4) is a mine, then the remaining 2 mines must be in (2,4), (1,6), (2,5), (2,6). \n\nAlso, (2,3) is 2 (row 2, column 3). Its adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2) is 0, (1,3) is 2, (1,4) is F, (2,2) is 0, (3,2) is 2 (row 3, column 2), (3,3) is 2 (row 3, column 3), (3,4) is 4 (row 3, column 4). So the unknowns here are (2,4). The number is 2, so if (1,4) is a mine, then (2,4) must be a mine (since 2 mines needed, and (1,4) is one, so (2,4) is the other). That makes (2,3)'s 2 correct. \n\nNow, (3,4) is 4 (row 3, column 4). Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 2 (uncovered), (3,3) is 2 (uncovered), (4,3) is ? (row 4, column 3 is ?). So the unknowns are (2,4), (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). The number is 4, meaning 4 mines in those 8 cells. From earlier, (2,4) is likely a mine (from (1,3) and (2,3) analysis). If (2,4) is a mine, then (3,4) needs 3 more mines. \n\nLooking at (3,3) which is 2 (row 3, column 3). Its adjacent cells: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). (2,2) is 0, (2,3) is 2, (3,2) is 2 (row 3, column 2 is 2), (3,4) is 4, (4,2) is 2 (row 4, column 2 is 2). So the unknowns are (2,4), (4,3), (4,4). The number is 2, so if (2,4) is a mine, then (4,3) and (4,4) must be safe (since 2 mines: (2,4) and one more? Wait, (3,3) has 2 mines. Let's count: (2,2) is 0 (safe), (2,3) is 2 (safe), (2,4) is ? (maybe mine), (3,2) is 2 (safe), (3,4) is 4 (safe), (4,2) is 2 (safe). So the possible mines are (2,4), (4,3), (4,4). So 2 mines here. If (2,4) is a mine, then one of (4,3) or (4,4) is a mine. \n\nThis is getting complex. Let's look for safe cells to uncover. The 0s in the top rows (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) are all 0s, which means their adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0: all 8 adjacent cells (which are (0,1), (0,-1 invalid), (1,0), (1,1), etc.) are safe. Since row 0, columns 0-2 are 0, their adjacent cells (like row 1, columns 0-2; row 2, columns 0-2) are all safe and uncovered, which they are (row 1 has 0s, row 2 has 0s). \n\nLooking at row 0, column 6 is 1 (row 0, column 6). Its adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 1 (uncovered), (1,5) is 3 (uncovered). So the unknowns are (0,7), (1,6), (1,7). The number 1 means there's 1 mine in those 3 cells. If we can find a safe cell here, maybe (0,7) is safe if (1,6) or (1,7) is a mine. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, row 4, column 0 is 1 (row 4, column 0). Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is 1 (uncovered), (3,1) is 1 (uncovered). So the unknowns are (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). The number 1 means 1 mine in those. If (4,1) is ?, maybe uncovering (4,1) is safe? Because if (4,0) is 1, and (3,0) and (3,1) are 1s, which are safe, then the mine could be in (4,1), (5,0), or (5,1). But we don't know. \n\nWait, let's check row 3, column 0 is 1 (row 3, column 0). Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are 0s (safe), (3,1) is 1 (safe), (4,0) is 1 (safe). So the only unknown is (4,1). The number 1 here means (4,1) must be a mine! Because all other adjacent cells are safe, so the mine is in (4,1). Oh, that's a key point. \n\nRow 3, column 0 (3,0) has value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,0) → 0 (safe)\n\n(2,1) → 0 (safe)\n\n(2,2) → 0 (safe)\n\n(3,1) → 1 (safe)\n\n(4,0) → 1 (safe)\n\n(4,1) → ? (unknown)\n\n(3,-1) invalid, (4,-1) invalid. So the only adjacent cell that's unknown is (4,1). Since the number is 1, that means exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are safe (uncovered), so (4,1) must be the mine. Therefore, (4,1) is a mine. So the user should flag (4,1). But wait, the current flags are 1\/19, so maybe they have a wrong flag. The F at (1,4) might be incorrect. Let's check (1,4) again. \n\n(1,4) is flagged. Let's see cell (1,3) is 2. (1,3) adjacent cells: (0,2)=0, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,4)=F, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?. So 8 cells. The uncovered ones are all safe (since they are numbers or 0s). So the mines must be in (1,4) and (2,4) to make 2 mines. So (1,4) is a mine, (2,4) is a mine. Then (1,5) is 3. (1,5) adjacent cells: (0,4)=1, (0,5)=1, (0,6)=1, (1,4)=F, (1,6)=?, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (2,6)=?. The uncovered ones are safe, so mines are (1,4), (2,4), and two more in (1,6), (2,5), (2,6) to make 3. So (1,4) is likely a correct flag. \n\nBut back to (3,0)=1. The only unknown adjacent cell is (4,1). So (4,1) must be a mine. So the user should flag (4,1). But the current action is to choose between uncover, flag, or unflag. The user's score is 1\/10 (since 1 correct flag), but the problem says \"Flags: 1\/19\" which might mean they have 1 flag, 19 total possible? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for 0 cells that have adjacent ?s. For example, row 0, column 2 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2. All adjacent cells are uncovered except maybe (0,2) is 0, but all 8 adjacent cells are already uncovered (since row 0, columns 0-3 are uncovered, row 1 columns 0-3 are uncovered). So no ?s there. \n\nRow 2, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=0, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=2. All uncovered, so no ?s. \n\nRow 1, column 0 is 0. Same as above, all adjacent cells uncovered. \n\nRow 0, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=0, (0,4)=1, (1,2)=0, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=F, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?. The number 1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The F at (1,4) is a mine, so that's 1. So (2,4) must be safe. Because 1 mine total. So (2,4) is safe. So we can uncover (2,4). \n\nYes! Let's verify. (0,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,2) → 0 (safe)\n\n(0,4) → 1 (safe)\n\n(1,2) → 0 (safe)\n\n(1,3) → 2 (safe)\n\n(1,4) → F (mine)\n\n(2,2) → 0 (safe)\n\n(2,3) → 2 (safe)\n\n(2,4) → ? (unknown)\n\nThe number 1 means exactly 1 mine in these 8 cells. We already have (1,4) as a mine (flagged), so there can't be another mine here. Therefore, (2,4) must be safe. So uncovering (2,4) is safe. That's a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,4)","uncover (2,4)"],"unflags":0,"seed":13,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to figure out what action to take in this Minesweeper game. The current board is all question marks, which means no cells have been uncovered or flagged yet. \n\nFirst, the game is on a 9x9 grid with 10 mines. The initial state has all cells as '?', so there's no information from uncovered cells. In Minesweeper, the best first move is usually to uncover a cell, preferably in the middle to get more information, but since all are unknown, any cell is a guess. \n\nThe user needs to input an action: uncover, flag, or unflag. Since no flags are placed yet, unflag isn't useful. Flagging a mine without any info is just a guess, but the first move is better to be uncovering a cell to reveal numbers, which helps in deducing mine locations. \n\nSo, I should choose to uncover a cell. Let's pick a central cell, maybe (4,4). That's a common starting point. So the action would be 'uncover (4,4)'.\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the rows are listed from row 0 to row 9, which makes sense as 10 rows (maybe a typo in the description saying 9x9, but the input shows 10 rows). Let's list out the current board rows properly:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly. Let's start by analyzing the known numbers and see if we can find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nFirst, let's note the positions of 0s because they mean no adjacent mines, so all their adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. For example, in row 2, column 4 and 5 are 0s (row 2, col 4 is 0, row 2, col 5 is 0). Let's check their adjacent cells.\n\nRow 2, col 4 (0): adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Looking at the current board:\n\n(1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 0 (row 3, col 4 is 0?), wait row 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\" so row 3, col 4 is 0. Oh right, row 3, col 4 is 0. So the 0 at row 2, col 4's adjacent cells include (3,4) which is 0. So all cells adjacent to 0s are safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, col 4 (0). Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check which of these are still unknown (marked as ?). \n\n(2,3) is 1 (known), (2,4) is 0 (known), (2,5) is 0 (known), (3,3) is 1 (known), (3,5) is 1 (known), (4,3) is 1 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ...\" so row 4, col 3 is 1), (4,4) is 0 (row 4, col 4 is 0), (4,5) is 1 (row 4, col 5 is 1). So all adjacent cells to row 3, col 4 (0) are already known. So no new info there.\n\nRow 4, col 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). All of these are known: (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0 (row 5, col 3 is 0), (5,4)=0 (row 5, col 4 is 0), (5,5)=1 (row 5, col 5 is 1). So again, all adjacent cells are known.\n\nRow 5, col 3 is 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\" so col 3 is 0). Adjacent cells: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). Let's check:\n\n(4,2) is 1 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ...\" so col 2 is 1), (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0 (row 5, col 2 is 0), (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0 (row 6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ...\" col 2 is 0), (6,3)=1 (row 6, col 3 is 1), (6,4)=1 (row 6, col 4 is 1). All these are known, so no new cells here.\n\nRow 5, col 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). All known: (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1 (row 6, col 5 is 1). So no unknown cells here.\n\nNow, let's look at the 1s and 2s to see if we can find mines or safe cells. Let's take row 3, col 1 which is 2. The cell at row 3, col 2 is unknown (marked as ?). Let's check the adjacent cells of row 3, col 1 (2). The 2 means there are 2 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nRow 3, col 0 is 1 (row 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ...\" so col 0 is 1). Row 4, col 0 is 0 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ...\" col 0 is 0). Row 4, col 1 is 1 (row 4, col 1 is 1). Row 4, col 2 is 1 (row 4, col 2 is 1). Row 2, col 0: row 2 is \"? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\" so col 0 is ?. Row 2, col 1: ?. Row 2, col 2: ?. Row 3, col 2: ?. So the 2 at (3,1) has adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) are unknown (4 cells), and (3,0)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. Wait, (3,0) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. So the 2 at (3,1) needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). Let's see if we can get more info from other cells.\n\nLooking at row 3, col 0 which is 1. The 1 at (3,0) means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,1) is 2 (a number, not a mine), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (number). So the adjacent cells for (3,0) 1 are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1) (but 3,1 is 2, not a mine), (4,0), (4,1). So the mine for (3,0) must be in (2,0) or (2,1). Because (3,0) has 1 mine, and the possible cells are (2,0) and (2,1) (since others are known numbers or 0).\n\nNow, the 2 at (3,1) has adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (3,0) (1), (4,0) (0), (4,1) (1), (4,2) (1). Since (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are not mines, the 2 mines must be in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). But from (3,0) 1, we know that exactly one of (2,0) or (2,1) is a mine. Let's say (2,0) is a mine: then (2,1) is safe. Then the 2 at (3,1) needs one more mine in (2,2) or (3,2). If (2,1) is a mine, then (2,0) is safe, and the 2 at (3,1) needs one more mine in (2,2) or (3,2). So not enough info here.\n\nLet's look at row 7, col 3 which is 1 (row 7: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" so col 3 is 1). The adjacent cells to (7,3) 1 are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Let's check these:\n\n(6,2) is 0 (row 6, col 2 is 0), (6,3) is 1 (row 6, col 3 is 1), (6,4) is 1 (row 6, col 4 is 1), (7,2) is 0 (row 7, col 2 is 0), (7,4) is ? (unknown), (8,2) is 0 (row 8, col 2 is 0), (8,3) is 2 (row 8, col 3 is 2), (8,4) is ? (unknown). So the 1 at (7,3) has adjacent cells: (6,2)=0 (safe), (6,3)=1 (number), (6,4)=1 (number), (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,4)=?, (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,3)=2 (number), (8,4)=?. So the 1 mine must be in (7,4) or (8,4). Because the other adjacent cells are known numbers or 0 (safe). So (7,4) and (8,4) are the only possible cells for the mine here. So exactly one of them is a mine.\n\nNow, row 8, col 3 is 2 (row 8: \"0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" so col 3 is 2). Let's check its adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). \n\n(7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (number), (7,4)=? (unknown), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,4)=? (unknown), (9,2)=0 (safe), (9,3)=1 (row 9, col 3 is 1), (9,4)=? (unknown). So the 2 at (8,3) needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The unknown cells here are (7,4), (8,4), (9,4). \n\nFrom the 1 at (7,3), we know that exactly one of (7,4) or (8,4) is a mine. Let's denote:\n\nLet M be the number of mines in (7,4), (8,4), (9,4). The 2 at (8,3) needs M=2.\n\nFrom (7,3) 1: (7,4) + (8,4) = 1 (since those are the only possible mines there). Let's say (7,4)=a, (8,4)=b, (9,4)=c. So a + b = 1 (from (7,3) 1). The 2 at (8,3) needs a + b + c = 2. Since a + b =1, then c=1. So (9,4) must be a mine. Because a + b is 1, adding c gives 2, so c=1. Therefore, (9,4) is a mine. That's a flag!\n\nWait, let's verify:\n\n(7,3) 1 has adjacent cells (7,4) and (8,4) as possible mines (others are safe or numbers). So exactly one of them is a mine.\n\n(8,3) 2 has adjacent cells (7,4), (8,4), (9,4) as possible mines (others are safe or numbers). So total mines there is 2. Since (7,4)+(8,4)=1, then (9,4) must be 1. So (9,4) is a mine. Therefore, we can flag (9,4).\n\nBut wait, let's check (9,3) which is 1 (row 9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" so col 3 is 1). The 1 at (9,3) has adjacent cells: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4) but wait, the board is 10 rows (0-9), so row 9 is the last. So adjacent cells are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (since row 10 doesn't exist). So (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2 (number), (8,4)=?, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=?, (so the 1 at (9,3) has adjacent cells (8,4) and (9,4) as possible mines. Because others are safe or numbers. So the 1 at (9,3) means that exactly one of (8,4) or (9,4) is a mine.\n\nFrom earlier, we have (9,4)=c=1 (mine). Then (8,4) must be 0 (safe) because (8,4) + (9,4) =1 (from (9,3) 1). So (8,4) is safe, (9,4) is a mine. That's consistent with the 2 at (8,3): (7,4) + (8,4) + (9,4) = a + 0 +1 = a +1 =2 (since 2 at (8,3) needs 2 mines). So a=1. Therefore, (7,4) is a mine, (8,4) is safe, (9,4) is a mine.\n\nSo (7,4) and (9,4) are mines, (8,4) is safe. Therefore, (8,4) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n(7,3) 1: adjacent mines are (7,4)=1 (mine) → correct, that's 1 mine.\n\n(8,3) 2: adjacent mines are (7,4)=1 and (9,4)=1 → total 2 → correct.\n\n(9,3) 1: adjacent mines are (9,4)=1 → correct.\n\nYes, that works. So (8,4) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLet's check the current board for (8,4): row 8 is \"0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so col 4 is the 5th cell (index 4) which is ?. So (8,4) is the cell to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there are other safe cells. Let's check row 6, col 6 (row 6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\" so col 6 is ?). What's the adjacent cells to row 6, col 5 (which is 1). Row 6, col 5 is 1. Adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=? (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" col 6 is ?), (6,4)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=? (from earlier, we think (7,4) is a mine), (7,5)=? (row 7: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" col 5 is ?), (7,6)=?. The 1 at (6,5) means 1 mine in these adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine (as per earlier), then that's one mine, so the rest (5,6), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6) must be safe. So (5,6), (6,6), (7,5), (7,6) are safe. So those can be uncovered.\n\nBut let's focus on the earlier conclusion that (8,4) is safe. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nYes, because (8,4) is adjacent to (8,3) which is 2. We determined that (8,4) is safe, so uncovering it would show a number. Let's go with that.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,4)","uncover (8,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current Minesweeper board and see which cells are safe to uncover or which might be mines. \n\nThe board provided is a 9x9 grid, but let me check the rows. Wait, the user listed 10 rows, which is 0-9, so that's correct for a 10-row grid (rows 0-9). Let me list out the current state row by row to visualize better:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nLet's start by looking at the cells that are already uncovered, especially the 0s, because 0s mean there are no mines in adjacent cells, so all adjacent cells can be safely uncovered.\n\nLooking at Row 2, column 4 and 5: (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0. Let's check their adjacent cells. A 0 in Minesweeper means all 8 surrounding cells are safe. So (2,4) is 0, so the cells around it (rows 1-3, columns 3-5) should be safe. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,4):\n\nAdjacent cells to (2,4):\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nBut (2,4) is 0, so all these cells have 0 mines. Let's check what's already known:\n\n(1,3) is 1 (from row 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ... so (1,3) is 1)\n(1,4) is 1 (row 1, column 4)\n(1,5) is 1 (row 1, column 5)\n(2,3) is 1 (row 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ... so (2,3) is 1)\n(2,5) is 0 (given)\n(3,3) is 1 (row 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ... so (3,3) is 1)\n(3,4) is 0 (row 3, column 4)\n(3,5) is 1 (row 3, column 5)\n\nSo all these are numbers, which is consistent with 0, since 0 just means no mines adjacent, but the numbers indicate the count of mines in their own adjacent cells. So maybe the 0s here don't directly help with new uncovers. Let's look for other 0s.\n\nRow 4, column 0 is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. (4,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells (rows 3-5, columns 0-1) are safe. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1)\n\n(3,0) is 1 (row 3: 1 2 ... so (3,0)=1)\n(3,1) is 2 (row 3: 1 2 ... (3,1)=2)\n(4,1) is 1 (row 4: 0 1 ... (4,1)=1)\n(5,0) is 0 (row 5: 0 0 ... (5,0)=0)\n(5,1) is 0 (row 5: 0 0 ... (5,1)=0)\nThese are all uncovered, so no new info here.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-4 are 0s. For example, (5,2) is 0. Its adjacent cells (rows 4-6, columns 1-3) should be safe. Let's check (5,2):\n\nAdjacent cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3)\n\n(4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,3)=0 (row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1... so (5,3)=0), (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=0 (row 6: 0 0 0 1 ... (6,3)=1). So (6,3) is 1, which is already uncovered. So no new cells here.\n\nRow 6, column 3 is 1. Let's see. Maybe look at a cell with a number that has some unknowns around it. Let's take (3,1) which is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,1) is 2, meaning there are 2 mines in the 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (3,1) are:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n(3,0), (3,2),\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\nWe know some of these:\n\n(3,0)=1 (uncovered), (4,0)=0 (uncovered), (4,1)=1 (uncovered), (4,2)=1 (uncovered). So the unknowns here are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nSo (3,1)=2, which counts the mines in those 8 cells. Let's list the known cells: (3,0)=1 (but 1 is a number, not a mine), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So the only possible mines are in the unknown cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). So 2 mines among these 4 cells.\n\nNot sure yet. Let's check (3,3)=1. Adjacent cells to (3,3):\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n(3,2), (3,4),\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nKnown cells: (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,4)=0 (uncovered), (3,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,2)=1 (uncovered), (4,3)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=0 (uncovered). So unknowns here are (2,2), (3,2). So (3,3)=1, which means there's 1 mine in (2,2) or (3,2).\n\nEarlier, (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). And (3,3)=1 has 1 mine in (2,2), (3,2). Let's denote variables:\n\nLet a = (2,0) is mine (0 or 1)\nb = (2,1) is mine (0 or 1)\nc = (2,2) is mine (0 or 1)\nd = (3,2) is mine (0 or 1)\n\nFrom (3,1)=2: a + b + c + d = 2\nFrom (3,3)=1: c + d = 1\nSo substituting, a + b + 1 = 2 → a + b = 1. So either a=1 and b=0, or a=0 and b=1.\n\nNot enough info yet. Let's check another cell. Let's look at (8,3)=2 and (8,4)=3. \n\n(8,3)=2: adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\nKnown cells: (7,2)=0 (row 7: 0 0 0 1 ... (7,2)=0), (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3=1), (8,2)=0 (row 8: 0 0 0 2 ... (8,2)=0), (9,2)=0 (row 9: 0 0 0 1 ... (9,2)=0), (9,3)=1 (row 9, column 3=1). So unknowns here are (7,4), (8,4)=3 (which is a number, not a mine), (9,4). Wait, (8,4) is 3, which is part of the adjacent cells of (8,3), but (8,4) is a number, so it's not a mine. So (8,3)=2: the adjacent mines are in (7,4), (9,4). Because (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (8,2)=0 (safe), (9,2)=0 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So (7,4) and (9,4) could be mines. Let's count: 2 mines needed here. So (7,4) and (9,4) are both mines? Because those are the only unknowns adjacent to (8,3). Let's check.\n\nThen (8,4)=3: adjacent cells. (8,4) is 3, so 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's list them:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\nKnown cells: (7,3)=1 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So unknowns: (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). \n\nIf (8,3)=2 requires 2 mines, and those are (7,4) and (9,4), then (8,4)=3's adjacent mines would be (7,4), (9,4), and one more (either (7,5), (8,5), or (9,5)). Let's see:\n\nIf (7,4) and (9,4) are mines (2 mines), then (8,4)=3 needs one more mine. Let's check (7,5), (8,5), (9,5). \n\nAlso, (7,3)=1 (row 7: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ...). (7,3)=1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent to (7,3):\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4),\n(7,2), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\nKnown cells: (6,2)=0 (row 6: 0 0 0 1 ... (6,2)=0), (6,3)=1 (row 6, column 3=1), (6,4)=1 (row 6, column 4=1), (7,2)=0 (safe), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe). So unknowns here are (6,4)=1 (already known), (7,4). So (7,3)=1 has adjacent mines: (6,4) is 1 (but 1 is a number, not a mine), (7,4). Wait, (6,4)=1 is a number, so the mine count for (7,3)=1 must come from (7,4) or (6,3) or (6,5)? Wait, (6,3)=1 (row 6, column 3 is 1, which is a number, not a mine). So (7,3)=1's adjacent mines: let's list all 8 adjacent cells:\n\n(6,2) → 0 (safe)\n(6,3) → 1 (safe)\n(6,4) → 1 (safe)\n(7,2) → 0 (safe)\n(7,4) → unknown (could be mine)\n(8,2) → 0 (safe)\n(8,3) → 2 (safe)\n(8,4) → 3 (safe)\n\nSo the only possible mine adjacent to (7,3)=1 is (7,4). Because all others are safe (numbers or 0). So (7,3)=1 implies that (7,4) must be a mine (since that's the only adjacent unknown cell). Because if (7,4) is not a mine, then (7,3)=1 would have 0 mines around it, which contradicts. So (7,4) is a mine! That's a key insight.\n\nSo (7,4) is a mine. Then, going back to (8,3)=2: adjacent mines. (7,4) is a mine, so there's 1 mine. The other mine must be in (9,4), because (8,3)=2 needs 2 mines. Let's confirm:\n\n(8,3)=2's adjacent cells: (7,4) is mine (1), (9,4) must be mine (2). That works. So (9,4) is a mine.\n\nNow, (8,4)=3: adjacent mines. (7,4) is mine (1), (9,4) is mine (2), so it needs 1 more mine. Let's look at the adjacent cells of (8,4):\n\n(7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=mine (1), (7,5)=unknown,\n(8,3)=2 (safe), (8,5)=unknown,\n(9,3)=1 (safe), (9,4)=mine (2), (9,5)=unknown.\n\nSo the third mine must be in (7,5), (8,5), or (9,5). Let's check (6,4)=1 (row 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ... (6,4)=1). (6,4)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(5,3), (5,4), (5,5),\n(6,3), (6,5),\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n\nKnown cells: (5,3)=0 (row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ... (5,3)=0), (5,4)=0 (row 5, column 4=0), (5,5)=1 (row 5, column 5=1), (6,3)=1 (row 6, column 3=1), (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3=1), (7,4)=mine (so that's 1 mine). So (6,4)=1's adjacent mines: (7,4) is 1 mine, so the other adjacent cells must have 0. (5,5)=1 is a number, (6,5) is unknown, (7,5) is unknown. So (6,4)=1 has 1 mine (from (7,4)), so (6,5) and (7,5) must be safe. Because 1 mine total. So (6,5) and (7,5) are not mines. That's because (6,4)=1's adjacent cells: (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1 (safe), (6,3)=1 (safe), (6,5)=unknown, (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=mine (1), (7,5)=unknown. So total mines here is 1 (from (7,4)), so (6,5) and (7,5) can't be mines. Therefore, (7,5) is safe.\n\nSo (7,5) is safe. Then, (8,4)=3's third mine can't be (7,5), so it must be in (8,5) or (9,5). Let's check (9,3)=1 (row 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ... (9,3)=1). Adjacent cells to (9,3):\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,4),\n(10,2), (10,3), (10,4) → but the grid is 9x9, so rows 0-9, columns 0-8? Wait, the initial problem says 9x9 grid, but the current board shows 10 rows. Maybe a typo. Let's assume it's 10x10? Because the input example shows (3,4), which is row 3, column 4, and the current board has 10 rows (0-9) and 10 columns (0-9). So 10x10. So (9,3) is valid.\n\nAdjacent cells to (9,3):\n\n(8,2)=0 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe),\n(9,2)=0 (safe), (9,4)=mine (1),\n(10,2) → invalid (since rows are 0-9), (10,3) invalid, (10,4) invalid.\n\nSo (9,3)=1's adjacent mines: only (9,4) is a mine. That's 1 mine, which matches (9,3)=1. So that's correct.\n\nBack to (8,4)=3. We have (7,4)=mine, (9,4)=mine, so need 1 more. Let's check (8,5). Let's see (7,5) is safe (from earlier). What about (6,5)=1 (row 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ... (6,5)=1). (6,5)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(5,4), (5,5), (5,6),\n(6,4), (6,6),\n(7,4), (7,5), (7,6)\n\nKnown cells: (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (7,4)=mine (1), (7,5)=safe. So (6,5)=1 has 1 mine (from (7,4)), so the other adjacent cells (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) must be safe. So (5,6) is safe.\n\n(5,5)=1 (row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ... (5,5)=1). Adjacent cells to (5,5):\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n(5,4), (5,6),\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\nKnown cells: (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe). So (5,5)=1's adjacent mines: (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Since (5,5)=1, there's 1 mine among these three. But (5,6) is safe (from (6,5)=1's analysis), so the mine is either (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nNot sure yet. Let's look for a safe cell to uncover. Let's see, (7,4) is a mine (flagged), (9,4) is a mine. What about other cells. Let's look at (3,4)=0. (3,4) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells to (3,4):\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nAll of these are already uncovered: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. So no new cells here.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4 is a mine (as per earlier analysis), so (7,4) should be flagged. But the current action is to uncover a cell. Let's find a cell that's unknown and safe.\n\nLet's check (7,5): we determined it's safe (from (6,4)=1's analysis). So (7,5) is a '?', and it's safe. So uncovering (7,5) would be safe. Let's confirm:\n\n(6,4)=1 has adjacent cells including (7,5), and we found that (7,5) can't be a mine because (6,4)=1 only has 1 mine (from (7,4)), so (7,5) is safe. So (7,5) is a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: (5,6). From (6,5)=1's analysis, (5,6) is safe. Let's check (5,6):\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ... so (5,6) is '?'. Since (6,5)=1's adjacent cells include (5,6), and (6,5)=1 has 1 mine (from (7,4)), (5,6) is safe. So (5,6) is safe.\n\nAlso, (7,5) is in row 7, column 5: current board row 7 is \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so (7,5) is '?'. Uncovering (7,5) is safe.\n\nAnother possible cell: (8,5). Let's see. (8,4)=3 has 3 mines, two of which are (7,4) and (9,4), so the third could be (8,5). But we don't know yet. So (8,5) might be a mine, so better not uncover.\n\n(9,5) is also unknown, but (8,4)=3's third mine could be there. So risky.\n\nHow about (2,2)? Let's go back to earlier. (3,3)=1 has (2,2) and (3,2) as possible mines (1 mine total). (3,1)=2 has (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) as possible mines (2 total). Since (3,3)=1 has 1 mine in (2,2) and (3,2), (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). So if (2,2) and (3,2) have 1 mine, then (2,0) and (2,1) must have 1 mine (since 2-1=1). So (2,0) and (2,1) have 1 mine between them, and (2,2) and (3,2) have 1 mine. So (2,2) could be safe or a mine. Not sure.\n\nWhat about (3,2)? It's '?'. (3,2) is in row 3, column 2: row 3 is \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". So (3,2) is '?'. If (3,2) is a mine, then (3,3)=1 would have 1 mine (correct), and (3,1)=2 would have (3,2) as mine, so (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) need 1 more mine. If (3,2) is safe, then (2,2) is a mine, and (3,1)=2 would need (2,0) and (2,1) to have 1 mine. So (3,2) could be safe or mine. Not sure.\n\nLet's go back to (7,5). Since we determined (7,5) is safe, uncovering it would be a good move. Let's check the coordinates: row 7, column 5. So the action would be 'uncover (7,5)'.\n\nAnother check: (7,5) is adjacent to (6,5)=1. (6,5)=1's adjacent mines are (7,4) (mine), so (7,5) is safe. So yes, (7,5) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,5)","uncover (7,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current Minesweeper board and see which cells are safe to uncover or which might be mines. Let's start by analyzing the revealed numbers to find clues.\n\nThe board provided is a 9x9 grid, but wait, the user wrote rows from 0 to 9, which is 10 rows? Maybe that's a typo, but let's assume it's 9x9. Let's list the rows properly. Let's index rows 0 to 8 and columns 0 to 8.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Assuming 9 columns)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?  (Hmm, maybe row 9 is a mistake, perhaps it's row 8. Let's check the input again. The user wrote \"Current Board:\" with 10 rows. Maybe it's a 10x9 grid? Or maybe a typo. Let's proceed, maybe rows are 0-9, columns 0-8. Let's note the positions.)\n\nLet's list the coordinates with revealed numbers. For example, in row 2, column 3 is 1, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 1. The 0s are important because they mean all adjacent cells are safe. So, a 0 in (2,4) and (2,5) means all 8 surrounding cells are safe. Let's check (2,4): adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Since (2,4) is 0, all those adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's see if those cells are already uncovered. (2,3) is 1 (row 2, column 3 is 1), which is okay because 1 is the count. (2,5) is 0, which is also a 0. (3,4) in row 3, column 4 is 0. So (3,4) is 0, which is safe. (3,5) is 1 (row 3, column 5 is 1). So, (2,4) being 0 tells us that cells like (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5) are safe. But some of these are already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 is 0. So the adjacent cells to (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,4) is 0, so all these adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's check which are uncovered: (2,3) is 1 (already uncovered), (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1 (row 3, column 3 is 1), (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is 1 (row 4, column 3 is 1), (4,4) is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0), (4,5) is 1 (row 4, column 5 is 1). So all these are already uncovered, which makes sense.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, in row 4, column 0 is 0. The adjacent cells to (4,0) are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is 1 (row 3, column 0 is 1), (3,1) is 2 (row 3, column 1 is 2), (4,1) is 1 (row 4, column 1 is 1), (5,0) is 0 (row 5, column 0 is 0), (5,1) is 0 (row 5, column 1 is 0). So (4,0) being 0 tells us those adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is in row 5, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,0) is 0, (4,1) is 1, (5,1) is 0, (6,0) is 0 (row 6, column 0 is 0), (6,1) is 0 (row 6, column 1 is 0). All safe, already uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 1 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,0) 0, (4,1) 1, (4,2) 1 (row 4, column 2 is 1), (5,0) 0, (5,2) 0 (row 5, column 2 is 0), (6,0) 0, (6,1) 0, (6,2) 0 (row 6, column 2 is 0). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 2 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,1) 1, (4,2) 1, (4,3) 1 (row 4, column 3 is 1), (5,1) 0, (5,3) 0 (row 5, column 3 is 0), (6,1) 0, (6,2) 0, (6,3) 0 (row 6, column 3 is 0). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,2) 1, (4,3) 1, (4,4) 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0), (5,2) 0, (5,4) 0 (row 5, column 4 is 0), (6,2) 0, (6,3) 0, (6,4) 1 (row 6, column 4 is 1). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) 1, (4,4) 0, (4,5) 1 (row 4, column 5 is 1), (5,3) 0, (5,5) 1 (row 5, column 5 is 1), (6,3) 0, (6,4) 1, (6,5) 1 (row 6, column 5 is 1). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0) 0, (5,1) 0, (6,1) 0, (7,0) 0 (row 7, column 0 is 0), (7,1) 0 (row 7, column 1 is 0). Safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 1 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (5,0) 0, (5,1) 0, (5,2) 0, (6,0) 0, (6,2) 0, (7,0) 0, (7,1) 0, (7,2) 0 (row 7, column 2 is 0). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 2 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,1) 0, (5,2) 0, (5,3) 0, (6,1) 0, (6,3) 0 (row 6, column 3 is 0), (7,1) 0, (7,2) 0, (7,3) 0 (row 7, column 3 is 0). All safe, uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,2) 0, (5,3) 0, (5,4) 0, (6,2) 0, (6,4) 1 (row 6, column 4 is 1), (7,2) 0, (7,3) 0, (7,4) is '?' (row 7, column 4 is '?'). Wait, row 7 is: 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? (assuming columns 0-8). So row 7, column 3 is 1, column 4 is '?', column 5 is 2. So (6,3) is 0, adjacent cell (7,4) is '?'. Since (6,3) is 0, (7,4) must be safe (no mine). So (7,4) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet me confirm. (6,3) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,2): 0 (uncovered)\n(5,3): 0 (uncovered)\n(5,4): 0 (uncovered)\n(6,2): 0 (uncovered)\n(6,4): 1 (uncovered)\n(7,2): 0 (uncovered)\n(7,3): 1 (uncovered)\n(7,4): '?' (unknown)\n\nSince (6,3) is 0, (7,4) must have 0 mines. Therefore, (7,4) is safe to uncover. That's a good candidate.\n\nAnother 0 area: row 4, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) is 1 (row 3, column 3 is 1), (3,4) is 0 (row 3, column 4 is 0), (3,5) is 1 (row 3, column 5 is 1), (4,3) is 1 (row 4, column 3 is 1), (4,5) is 1 (row 4, column 5 is 1), (5,3) is 0 (row 5, column 3 is 0), (5,4) is 0 (row 5, column 4 is 0), (5,5) is 1 (row 5, column 5 is 1). All these are uncovered, so nothing new here.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3 is 1. Let's check (7,3) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,2): 0 (uncovered)\n(6,3): 0 (uncovered)\n(6,4): 1 (uncovered)\n(7,2): 0 (uncovered)\n(7,4): '?' (unknown)\n(8,2): 0 (row 8, column 2 is 0)\n(8,3): 2 (row 8, column 3 is 2)\n(8,4): 3 (row 8, column 4 is 3)\n\nSo (7,3) is 1, meaning exactly one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (7,4). The others are uncovered. So if (7,3) is 1, and all other adjacent cells (6,2, 6,3, 6,4, 7,2, 8,2, 8,3, 8,4) are known, then the only unknown is (7,4). Since (7,3) is 1, and the known adjacent cells (6,4 is 1, 8,3 is 2, 8,4 is 3) are numbers, not mines. So (7,3) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which must be (7,4). Wait, but earlier we thought (6,3) is 0, which would mean (7,4) is safe. There's a contradiction here. Let me recheck.\n\n(6,3) is 0. The adjacent cells of (6,3) are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). All of these cells except (7,4) are uncovered. Since (6,3) is 0, none of its adjacent cells can be mines. So (7,4) is not a mine. Therefore, (7,3) is 1, which counts the number of mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (7,3) are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). Let's list which of these could be mines:\n\n(6,2): 0 (safe)\n(6,3): 0 (safe)\n(6,4): 1 (safe, it's a number)\n(7,2): 0 (safe)\n(7,4): safe (from (6,3) being 0)\n(8,2): 0 (safe)\n(8,3): 2 (safe)\n(8,4): 3 (safe)\n\nSo none of the adjacent cells of (7,3) are mines. But (7,3) is 1, which is a problem. That suggests a mistake in my analysis. Maybe the row and column indices are different. Let's check the original board again.\n\nThe user wrote the current board as:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells)\n\nAh, each row has 10 cells, so the grid is 10 rows (0-9) and 10 columns (0-9). That's a 10x10 grid, not 9x9. The initial problem statement said 9x9, but the current board is 10x10. Maybe that's a mistake, but we'll go with the given board. So columns 0-9, rows 0-9.\n\nLet's reindex. For example, row 2, column 4 is 0 (since row 2: ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? → columns 0-9, so column 3 is 1, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 1).\n\nNow, let's take (6,3): row 6 is \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\", so column 3 is 1 (row 6, column 3 is 1). Earlier mistake: I thought (6,3) was 0, but no. Let's correct that.\n\nLet's list the coordinates properly with 10x10:\n\nRow 0: [0,0] to [0,9] all ?\nRow 1: [1,0]?, [1,1]?, [1,2]?, [1,3]1, [1,4]1, [1,5]1, [1,6]1, [1,7]?, [1,8]?, [1,9]?\nRow 2: [2,0]?, [2,1]?, [2,2]?, [2,3]1, [2,4]0, [2,5]0, [2,6]1, [2,7]?, [2,8]?, [2,9]?\nRow 3: [3,0]1, [3,1]2, [3,2]?, [3,3]1, [3,4]0, [3,5]1, [3,6]2, [3,7]?, [3,8]?, [3,9]?\nRow 4: [4,0]0, [4,1]1, [4,2]1, [4,3]1, [4,4]0, [4,5]1, [4,6]?, [4,7]?, [4,8]?, [4,9]?\nRow 5: [5,0]0, [5,1]0, [5,2]0, [5,3]0, [5,4]0, [5,5]1, [5,6]?, [5,7]?, [5,8]?, [5,9]?\nRow 6: [6,0]0, [6,1]0, [6,2]0, [6,3]1, [6,4]1, [6,5]1, [6,6]?, [6,7]?, [6,8]?, [6,9]?\nRow 7: [7,0]0, [7,1]0, [7,2]0, [7,3]1, [7,4]?, [7,5]2, [7,6]?, [7,7]?, [7,8]?, [7,9]?\nRow 8: [8,0]0, [8,1]0, [8,2]0, [8,3]2, [8,4]3, [8,5]?, [8,6]?, [8,7]?, [8,8]?, [8,9]?\nRow 9: [9,0]0, [9,1]0, [9,2]0, [9,3]1, [9,4]?, [9,5]?, [9,6]?, [9,7]?, [9,8]?, [9,9]?\n\nNow, let's look for 0s. For example, [2,4] is 0 (row 2, column 4). The adjacent cells to [2,4] (which is (2,4)) are:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\nThese cells are:\n\n(1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1. All are uncovered. Since [2,4] is 0, all adjacent cells have 0 mines, which is consistent because they are numbers (not mines).\n\n[2,5] is 0 (row 2, column 5). Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n(2,4), (2,6),\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n(1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. All uncovered, and no mines, which is correct.\n\n[3,4] is 0 (row 3, column 4). Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1.

All uncovered, no mines.\n\n[8,1] is 0 (row 8, column 1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,0), (7,1), (7,2),\n(8,0), (8,2),\n(9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\n(7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=0, (8,0)=0, (8,2)=0, (9,0)=0, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=0. All uncovered, no mines.\n\n[8,2] is 0 (row 8, column 2). Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,1), (7,2), (7,3),\n(8,1), (8,3),\n(9,1), (9,2), (9,3)\n\n(7,1)=0, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=0, (8,3)=2, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=1. All uncovered, no mines.\n\n[9,0] is 0 (row 9, column 0). Adjacent cells:\n\n(8,0), (8,1),\n(9,1),\nNo row 10, so only up. (9,0) has adjacent cells (8,0), (8,1), (9,1). All are 0, 0, 0. Safe.\n\n[9,1] is 0 (row 9, column 1). Adjacent cells: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2), (9,0), (9,2). All 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Safe.\n\n[9,2] is 0 (row 9, column 2). Adjacent cells: (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3). (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (9,1)=0, (9,3)=1. All uncovered, no mines.\n\nNow, let's look for cells adjacent to 0s that are still '?'. For example, [5,6] (row 5, column 6) is '?'. Let's see if any 0s are adjacent to it. The 0s in row 5 are [5,0] to [5,4]. [5,5] is 1. So [5,6] is to the right of [5,5] (which is 1). Let's check [5,5]=1. [5,5] is 1, so it has one mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of [5,5] are:\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n(5,4), (5,6),\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6)\n\n(4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?.\n\nSo [5,5] is 1, meaning exactly one mine in these 8 cells. The known cells (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1 are safe (not mines). So the possible mines are (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). So one of these three is a mine. Not sure yet.\n\nAnother area: [7,4] is '?'. Let's check [7,3]=1. [7,3] (row 7, column 3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4),\n(7,2), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\n\n(6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=?, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3.\n\nSo [7,3] is 1, which means one mine in these 8 cells. The known cells: (6,2)=0 (safe), (6,3)=1 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (7,2)=0 (safe), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe). So the only unknown is (7,4). Therefore, (7,4) must be the mine. Because [7,3] is 1, and the only unknown adjacent cell is (7,4), so (7,4) is a mine.\n\nWait, that makes sense. [7,3] has 1 mine in adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are safe (numbers or 0s), so the only possible mine is (7,4). Therefore, (7,4) is a mine. So we should flag it. But wait, let's confirm.\n\n[7,3] is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,2) → 0 (safe)\n(6,3) → 1 (safe, it's a number)\n(6,4) → 1 (safe)\n(7,2) → 0 (safe)\n(7,4) → ? (unknown)\n(8,2) → 0 (safe)\n(8,3) → 2 (safe)\n(8,4) → 3 (safe)\n\nSo the only cell that could be a mine is (7,4). Therefore, (7,4) is a mine. So we should flag (7,4).\n\nAnother check: [7,5] is 2. [7,5] (row 7, column 5) is 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6),\n(7,4), (7,6),\n(8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\n(6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=? (mine?), (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?.\n\nIf (7,4) is a mine, then [7,5] has that mine as one. [7,5] is 2, so there's another mine in its adjacent cells. Possible candidates could be (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), etc. But that's more complex.\n\nLet's check [8,3]=2 (row 8, column 3). Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n(7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=? (mine?), (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?.\n\n[8,3] is 2, so two mines in adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine, then there's one mine. The other could be (9,4). Let's see [9,3]=1 (row 9, column 3) is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,4),\n(10,2) (invalid), (10,3) (invalid), (10,4) (invalid)\n\nSo [9,3] has adjacent cells (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=?. So [9,3] is 1, meaning one mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (9,4). So (9,4) must be a mine. Therefore, [9,3]=1 has (9,4) as a mine.\n\nSo [8,3]=2 has adjacent mines at (7,4) and (9,4). That adds up to 2, which matches. So (7,4) and (9,4) are mines.\n\nLet's check [8,4]=3 (row 8, column 4) is 3. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n(7,3)=1, (7,4)=mine, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=mine, (9,5)=?.\n\nSo [8,4] is 3, which should count the number of mines in adjacent cells. So far, we have (7,4) and (9,4) as mines. That's 2. There must be one more mine in the adjacent cells. Possible candidates are (7,5) adjacent cells, but (7,5) is 2. Let's see (7,5)=2. Its adjacent cells include (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=mine, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?. So (7,5)=2 has two mines. We know (7,4) is a mine, so there's one more mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), or (8,6). If (8,5) is a mine, then [8,4] would have (7,4), (9,4), (8,5) as mines, totaling 3. That fits. So (8,5) could be a mine.\n\nBut maybe I'm getting ahead. Let's focus on cells that can be safely uncovered. Let's look for 0s that have adjacent '?' cells. For example, [4,6] (row 4, column 6) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells to [4,6]. The cell above is [3,6]=2 (row 3, column 6 is 2). [3,6] is 2, so it has two mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells of [3,6]:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5), (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n(2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?.\n\n[3,6]=2, so two mines here. Known cells: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1 are safe. So mines could be in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7).\n\nNot sure. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to multiple 0s. For example, [6,6] (row 6, column 6) is '?'. Adjacent cells include [5,5]=1, [5,6]=?, [5,7]=?, [6,5]=1, [6,7]=?, [7,5]=2, [7,6]=?, [7,7]=?.\n\nNot helpful. Let's go back to [7,4] being a mine. So we should flag (7,4). But the problem is the initial score is 0.0, flags are 0\/11. The total mines are 10, so maybe the user made a typo, but according to the problem statement, there are 10 mines. The current flags are 0\/11, which might be a mistake. Anyway, let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, [3,2] (row 3, column 2) is '?'. Let's check [3,1]=2 (row 3, column 1 is 2). [3,1] is 2, so two mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells of [3,1]:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n(3,0), (3,2),\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\n[3,0] is 1 (row 3, column 0 is 1). Adjacent cells of [3,0]:\n\n(2,0), (2,1),\n(3,1),\n(4,0)\n\n(2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=2, (4,0)=0.\n\n[3,0]=1, so one mine in (2,0), (2,1). [3,1]=2, so two mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of [3,1] include (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. Since [3,0]=1 has one mine in (2,0), (2,1), [3,1]=2 must have two mines, which are (2,0), (2,1), and possibly (2,2) or (3,2). If (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (1 each from [3,0]), then [3,1] would have those two mines, which fits 2. So (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, (2,2) and (3,2) are safe. Therefore, [3,2] is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLet's verify:\n\n[3,0]=1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). (4,0)=0 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe). So one mine in (2,0), (2,1).\n\n[3,1]=2. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So two mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). Since [3,0] has one mine in (2,0), (2,1), then [3,1] must have two mines. If (2,0) and (2,1) are the two mines, then that's two, which fits. Therefore, (2,2) and (3,2) are safe. So [3,2] is safe to uncover.\n\nThat's a good move. Let's confirm. If (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, then [3,0] (which is 1) has one mine (either (2,0) or (2,1)), but wait, [3,0] is 1, which counts the number of mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of [3,0] are:\n\nTop: (2,0), (2,1)\nLeft: none (column 0)\nRight: (3,1)\nBottom: (4,0)\n\nSo the adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). (3,1) is 2 (safe), (4,0) is 0 (safe). So [3,0] is 1, meaning one mine in (2,0) or (2,1).\n\n[3,1] is 2, which has adjacent cells:\n\nTop: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nLeft: (3,0)\nRight: (3,2)\nBottom: (4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So [3,1] is 2, meaning two mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nIf (2,0) is a mine, then [3,0] counts 1 (correct). Then [3,1] has (2,0) as one mine, so needs one more mine in (2,1), (2,2), (3,2).\n\nIf (2,1) is a mine, then [3,0] counts 1 (correct), and [3,1] has (2,1) as one mine, needing one more.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,0) and (2,1) are both mines, then [3,0] would be 2 (since two mines in adjacent cells), but [3,0] is 1. So that's impossible. Therefore, only one of (2,0) or (2,1) is a mine. Then [3,1] has that one mine plus another mine in (2,2) or (3,2), totaling 2.\n\nTherefore, (3,2) could be a mine or safe. This line of reasoning is getting complicated. Let's look for another safe cell.\n\nLet's check [6,6] (row 6, column 6). Adjacent to [5,5]=1. [5,5] has adjacent cells including [4,6], [5,6], [6,6]. If [5,5] is 1, and we don't know about those cells, maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother area: [2,3]=1 (row 2, column 3). Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n(2,2), (2,4),\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\n(1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=?, (2,4)=0, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0.\n\n[2,3] is 1, so one mine in these cells. (1,3)=1 (safe), (1,4)=1 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe). So possible mines in (1,2), (2,2), (3,2). So one of these three is a mine.\n\nNot helpful. Let's go back to the 0s. All the 0s have their adjacent cells uncovered, so there are no cells adjacent to 0s that are still '?'. Therefore, the remaining '?' cells are either adjacent to numbers or unknown.\n\nIn Minesweeper, when there are no obvious 0s to uncover, the next best move is to look for cells that are adjacent to numbers and see if the numbers can help deduce safe cells.\n\nLet's look at [3,2] again. [3,1]=2, [3,0]=1. [4,2]=1 (row 4, column 2 is 1). [4,2] has adjacent cells:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3),\n(4,1), (4,3),\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3)\n\n(3,1)=2, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0.\n\n[4,2] is 1, so one mine in its adjacent cells. The known cells: (3,1)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (5,1)=0 (safe), (5,2)=0 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe). So the only unknown is (3,2). Therefore, (3,2) must be the mine. Wait, that's a key point!\n\n[4,2] is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,1) → 2 (safe)\n(3,2) → ?\n(3,3) → 1 (safe)\n(4,1) → 1 (safe)\n(4,3) → 1 (safe)\n(5,1) → 0 (safe)\n(5,2) → 0 (safe)\n(5,3) → 0 (safe)\n\nSo [4,2] is 1, meaning exactly one mine in these 8 cells. All cells except (3,2) are safe (they are numbers or 0s, not mines). Therefore, (3,2) must be the mine. So (3,2) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,2).\n\nBut wait, let's confirm. [4,2] is 1. If (3,2) is a mine, then that's the one mine, which matches. So yes, (3,2) is a mine.\n\nAnother check: [3,1]=2. Its adjacent cells include (3,2). If (3,2) is a mine, then [3,1] has that mine plus another mine in its adjacent cells. Let's see [3,1] adjacent cells:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n(3,0), (3,2),\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2)\n\n(3,0)=1 (safe), (3,2)=mine (so that's one), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So [3,1] needs one more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So (2,0), (2,1), or (2,2) is another mine. That's possible.\n\nSo, (3,2) is a mine. So we should flag it. But let's see if there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nWait, let's look at [1,3]=1 (row 1, column 3). Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n(1,2), (1,4),\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n(0,2)=?, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=?, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0.\n\n[1,3] is 1, so one mine in these cells. (1,4)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe). So possible mines in (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2). Not helpful.\n\nAnother cell: [1,4]=1 (row 1, column 4). Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3), (0,4), (0,5),\n(1,3), (1,5),\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\n\n(0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0.\n\n[1,4] is 1, so one mine in these cells. (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0 are safe. So mines in (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). Not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's consider [7,6] (row 7, column 6) is '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,5), (6,6), (6,7),\n(7,5), (7,7),\n(8,5), (8,6), (8,7)\n\n(6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=?, (7,5)=2, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the win condition: uncover all safe cells or flag all mines. Since there are 10 mines, and the current flags are 0\/11 (maybe a typo, should be 0\/10), we need to flag 10 mines. But we need to find safe cells to uncover.\n\nWait, let's go back to the 0s. All 0s have their adjacent cells uncovered, so the next step is to look for cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number equals the number of adjacent flags, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe. But since we have no flags yet, that's not applicable.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells where the number of adjacent unknowns equals the number, meaning those unknowns are mines. For example, [7,3]=1 has one adjacent unknown (7,4), so (7,4) is a mine. As we deduced earlier.\n\nSimilarly, [9,3]=1 (row 9, column 3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,4),\n(10,2) (invalid), (10,3) (invalid), (10,4) (invalid)\n\nSo [9,3] is 1, and the adjacent cells are (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=?. So the only unknown is (9,4), which must be a mine. So (9,4) is a mine.\n\n[8,3]=2 (row 8, column 3) has adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n(7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=mine, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=mine. So [8,3] is 2, which counts (7,4) and (9,4) as mines. That's correct, so 2 mines.\n\n[8,4]=3 (row 8, column 4) has adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n(7,3)=1, (7,4)=mine, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=mine, (9,5)=?. So [8,4] is 3, which means there are 3 mines here. We already have two mines: (7,4) and (9,4). So there must be one more mine in (7,5), (8,5), (9,5). But (7,5)=2, which has adjacent cells including (7,4)=mine, so (7,5)=2 must have one more mine. Let's check [7,5]=2:\n\nAdjacent cells of [7,5]:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6),\n(7,4), (7,6),\n(8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\n(6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=mine, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?.\n\n[7,5]=2, so two mines. We have (7,4) as one, so one more mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). If [8,4]=3 needs one more mine, and [7,5]=2 needs one more mine, it's possible that (8,5) is that mine. So (8,5) is a mine. Then [8,4] has (7,4), (9,4), (8,5) as mines (3 total), which matches. [7,5] has (7,4) and (8,5) as mines (2 total), which matches. So (8,5) is a mine.\n\nContinuing, [7,5]=2 is satisfied, [8,4]=3 is satisfied.\n\nNow, [8,5] is a mine. Let's check [8,6] (row 8, column 6) is '?'. Adjacent cells include [8,5]=mine, so [8,6] might be a number. But we need to find a safe cell.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is not a mine. For example, [3,2] we thought might be a mine, but let's confirm with [4,2]=1. [4,2] is 1, adjacent to (3,2). So (3,2) is a mine.\n\nAnother cell: [2,2] (row 2, column 2) is '?'. Adjacent to [2,3]=1. [2,3]=1 has adjacent cells including (2,2). If (2,2) is a mine, then [2,3] would count it. But [2,3] is 1, and other adjacent cells are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0 are safe. So (2,2), (1,2), (3,2) could have one mine. Since (3,2) is a mine (from [4,2]=1), then [2,3]=1's mine is (3,2), so (2,2) and (1,2) are safe. Therefore, (2,2) is safe.\n\nYes! Let's see:\n\n[4,2]=1 → (3,2) is a mine.\n\n[2,3]=1 → adjacent cells include (3,2)=mine. So [2,3] counts that mine. Therefore, [2,3] is 1, which is satisfied by (3,2) being a mine. Therefore, the other adjacent cells of [2,3] (like (2,2), (1,2)) are safe. So (2,2) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nThat's a solid move. Let's confirm:\n\n[2,3] is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n(2,2), (2,4),\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4)\n\nWe know (3,2) is a mine (from [4,2]=1). (1,3)=1 (safe), (1,4)=1 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe). So the mine in [2,3] is (3,2). Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells (1,2), (2,2) are safe. So (2,2) can be safely uncovered.\n\nThat's a good move. So the action should be to uncover (2,2).\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,2)","uncover (2,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but wait, the first row has 10 question marks? Maybe that's a typo, but I'll assume it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the first line is a mistake. Let's focus on the rows that make sense.\n\nLooking at the board, let's list out the visible cells. The coordinates are (row, col), with (0,0) being top-left. Let's note the known numbers and their positions.\n\nRow 1 (index 1) has \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\" — wait, maybe rows are 0-indexed. Let's list each row properly:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, 9x9 grid should have rows 0-8, maybe the user made a mistake in row indices. Maybe rows are 0-8, so the last row is row 8. Let's adjust. Let's assume rows are 0-8, 9 rows. So the input might have a formatting error, but let's proceed with the data given.)\n\nLet's correct the rows to 0-8 (9 rows):\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? \nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? \nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? \nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? \nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? \n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. Let's start with the 0s, because 0 means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 4 and 5 (0-based): (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0. Their adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check the 0 at (2,4). The adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But (2,4) is 0, so all 8 neighbors have 0 mines. Let's see which of these are still '?'.\n\n(2,4) is 0. Let's list its neighbors:\n\n- (1,3): row 1, column 3 is 1 (already uncovered)\n- (1,4): row 1, column 4 is 1 (uncovered)\n- (1,5): row 1, column 5 is 1 (uncovered)\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3 is 1 (uncovered)\n- (2,5): row 2, column 5 is 0 (uncovered)\n- (3,3): row 3, column 3 is 1 (uncovered)\n- (3,4): row 3, column 4 is 0 (uncovered)\n- (3,5): row 3, column 5 is 1 (uncovered)\nSo all neighbors of (2,4) are already uncovered.\n\nNext, (2,5) is 0. Its neighbors are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). Let's check which are '?':\n\n- (1,6): row 1, column 6 is '?' (needs to be checked)\n- (2,6): row 2, column 6 is 1 (uncovered)\n- (3,6): row 3, column 6 is 2 (uncovered)\nSo (1,6) is a neighbor of (2,5) which is 0. Since (2,5) has 0 mines around, (1,6) must be safe (since 0 means no mines in adjacent cells). Therefore, (1,6) can be uncovered safely.\n\nWait, (2,5) is 0. The cell (1,6) is adjacent to (2,5). Since (2,5) has 0 adjacent mines, (1,6) cannot be a mine. So (1,6) is safe to uncover.\n\nLet's check another 0. For example, row 4, column 0: (4,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells would be (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). But (4,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's check if those are already uncovered. (3,0) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (4,1) is 1, (5,0) is 0, (5,1) is 0. All are uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 0: (5,0) is 0. Its neighbors are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). All are uncovered (4,0 is 0, 4,1 is 1; 5,1 is 0; 6,0 is 0; 6,1 is 0). So no new cells here.\n\nRow 5, column 1: (5,1) is 0. Neighbors include (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (5,0), (5,2), (6,0), (6,1), (6,2). (4,2) is 1 (row 4, column 2: row 4 is \"0 1 1 1 0 1...\", so (4,2) is 1, which is uncovered. (5,2) is 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1...\", so (5,2) is 0, uncovered. (6,2) is 0 (row 6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1...\", (6,2) is 0, uncovered). So no new cells.\n\nRow 5, column 2: (5,2) is 0. Its neighbors: (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,3) is 1 (row 4, column 3: 1), (5,3) is 0 (row 5, column 3: 0), (6,3) is 1 (row 6, column 3: 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 3: (5,3) is 0. Its neighbors: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,4) is 0 (row 4, column 4: 0), (5,4) is 0 (row 5, column 4: 0), (6,4) is 1 (row 6, column 4: 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4: (5,4) is 0. Its neighbors: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,5) is 1 (row 4, column 5: 1), (5,5) is 1 (row 5, column 5: 1), (6,5) is 1 (row 6, column 5: 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0: (6,0) is 0. Neighbors are (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (7,0) is 0 (row 7, column 0: 0), (7,1) is 0 (row 7, column 1: 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 1: (6,1) is 0. Neighbors: (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (7,2) is 0 (row 7, column 2: 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 2: (6,2) is 0. Neighbors: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (7,3) is 1 (row 7, column 3: 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 0: (7,0) is 0. Neighbors: (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). (8,0) is 0 (row 8, column 0: 0), (8,1) is 0 (row 8, column 1: 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 1: (7,1) is 0. Neighbors: (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,0), (7,2), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). (8,2) is 0 (row 8, column 2: 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 2: (7,2) is 0. Neighbors: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (8,3) is 2 (row 8, column 3: 2). All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 0: (8,0) is 0. Neighbors: (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0), but wait, if it's 9x9, row 8 is the last. So (8,0) neighbors are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 1: (8,1) is 0. Neighbors: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2). But assuming 9x9, row 8 is last, so (8,1) neighbors are (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2). (8,2) is 0 (row 8, column 2: 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 2: (8,2) is 0. Neighbors: (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3). (7,3) is 1 (row 7, column 3: 1), (8,3) is 2 (row 8, column 3: 2). All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at the 1s and 2s to find possible safe cells. Let's take row 3, column 0: (3,0) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). (2,0) and (2,1) are '?', (3,1) is 2, (4,0) is 0. So (3,0) is 1, meaning exactly one of its adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1) is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 1: (3,1) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are '?', (3,2) is '?', (3,0) is 1, (4,0) is 0, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. So (3,1) is 2, which means two of the adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2) are mines.\n\nRow 2, column 2: (2,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) are '?', (3,2) is '?', (1,3) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is 1. So (2,2) is 2, meaning two mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nThis might be getting complicated. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which we know is safe. Earlier, (2,5) is 0. Its adjacent cell (1,6) is '?'. Since (2,5) is 0, (1,6) can't be a mine, so uncovering (1,6) is safe.\n\nLet's confirm: (2,5) is 0. The 8 adjacent cells to (2,5) are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). We know (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,4) is 0, (2,6) is 1, (3,4) is 0, (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is 2. So the only '?' in these is (1,6). Since (2,5) has 0 mines around, (1,6) must be safe. Therefore, (1,6) can be safely uncovered.\n\nAnother possible cell: (3,4) is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,4) is 0 (row 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\", so (3,4) is 0). Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 1. All uncovered, so no new cells here.\n\nWhat about (7,5) is 2 (row 7: \"0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ?\"). (7,5) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4) is 1, (6,5) is 1, (7,4) is '?', (8,4) is 3, (8,5) is '?'. So (7,5) is 2, which might have 2 mines in adjacent cells, but not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, (8,3) is 2 (row 8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\"). (8,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,2) is 0, (7,3) is 1, (7,4) is '?', (8,2) is 0, (8,4) is 3, (9,2) is 0 (row 9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,2) is 0). So (8,3) is 2, which might relate to (7,4) and (9,3) or (9,4), but not sure.\n\nBack to (1,6). Since (2,5) is 0, (1,6) is safe. Let's check if (1,6) is adjacent to any other numbers. (1,6) is in row 1, column 6. Let's see its adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (1,5) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 1. The others are '?'. Uncovering (1,6) should reveal a number (since adjacent to (1,5)=1 and (2,6)=1, but since (2,5)=0, (1,6) can't be a mine. So this is a safe move.\n\nAnother possible safe cell: (4,6). Let's check row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ?\". (4,6) is '?'. What's adjacent to (4,6)? Its neighbors are (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (5,5), (5,6), (5,7). (3,5) is 1, (3,6) is 2, (4,5) is 1, (5,5) is 1. So (4,6) is adjacent to (3,6)=2. Let's see (3,6) is 2. (3,6) has adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1. So (3,6) is 2, which means there are 2 mines in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). But not sure yet.\n\nBut (1,6) is a safer bet because it's adjacent to a 0, which guarantees it's safe. So the best move is to uncover (1,6).\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the given current board seems to have 10 columns? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me check again. Oh, maybe it's a formatting error. Let's assume it's a 9x9 grid, so each row should have 9 cells. Let me parse the current board row by row.\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (9 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (Wait, that's 9? Let's count: 0-8 columns. So row 1 has columns 0-8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [?, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [1, 2, ?, 1, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 2, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] Wait, but 9x9 grid should have rows 0-8. Maybe the user made a mistake in the row indices. Let's assume rows 0-8, so row 8 is the last. Let's adjust. Maybe the input has a typo, but I'll proceed.\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe or definitely mines.\n\nFirst, let's look at cells with 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. For example, in row 2, column 4 is 0 (row 2, col 4). So all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check which cells are adjacent to (2,4). The adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Looking at row 1, columns 3-5 are 1,1,1. Row 2, columns 3 is 1, column 5 is 0. Row 3, columns 3 is 1, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 1. So (2,4) being 0 means all those adjacent cells are safe. But some of them are already uncovered (like (3,4) is 0). Wait, (3,4) is 0, which is an uncovered cell, so that's correct.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check: (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 1. All of these are uncovered, so that's consistent with 0 (no mines adjacent).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are unknown (?) and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines based on the numbers around them.\n\nTake row 3, column 2: it's a '?'. Let's check the adjacent numbers. The cell (3,2) is adjacent to (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). Let's list the known numbers around (3,2):\n\n(2,2) is 2, (2,3) is 1, (3,1) is 2, (3,3) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 1.\n\nWait, (3,1) is 2 (row 3, column 1: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\" so row 3 is [1,2,?,1,0,1,2,?,?]. So (3,1) is 2.\n\nThe cell (3,1) is a 2, which means there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Let's list adjacent cells to (3,1):\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nKnown cells in these: (3,0) is 1 (row 3 starts with 1), (4,0) is 0, (4,1) is 1, (4,2) is 1. The others are (2,0) (row 2, col 0: ?), (2,1) (row 2, col 1: ?), (2,2) (row 2, col 2: 2), (3,2) (row 3, col 2: ?).\n\nSo (3,1) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The known cells here are (3,0)=1 (uncovered, safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So the possible mines are in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). But (2,2) is 2, which is an uncovered number, so it's safe. So (2,2) is not a mine. So the possible mine locations for (3,1)'s 2 are (2,0), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nNow, let's check (2,2) which is 2. The cell (2,2) is 2, so it has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nKnown cells here: (1,3)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). The others are (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,2)=?.\n\nSo (2,2) has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nNow, (3,1) is 2, which needs 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). (2,2) is 2, which needs 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). Let's see if there's overlap.\n\nIf (3,2) is a mine, then (3,1) would have one mine there, so it needs one more in (2,0) or (2,1). Then (2,2) would have one mine in (3,2), so it needs one more in (1,1), (1,2), or (2,1). But this might not be definitive.\n\nLet's look at another area. Row 7, column 4 is a '?'. Let's check its neighbors. Row 7: [0,0,0,1,?,2,?,?,?]. So (7,3)=1, (7,5)=2. (7,4) is the cell in question.\n\nAdjacent to (7,4) (row 7, column 4) are:\n\n(6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5).\n\nKnown cells: (6,3)=1 (row 6: [0,0,0,1,1,1,...]), (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=1, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2 (row 8: [0,0,0,2,3,...]), (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?.\n\n(7,5) is 2, which means 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Adjacent to (7,5) are:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6).\n\nKnown cells: (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (7,4)=? (unknown), (8,4)=3 (safe), (8,5)=? (unknown). So the possible mines are (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6).\n\n(7,5)=2, so two mines in those five cells.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 3. Adjacent to (8,4) are:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). Wait, if the grid is 9x9, row 8 is the last, so (9,3) would be out of bounds. Let's correct to 0-8 rows and 0-8 columns. So (8,4) adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (7,3) is (7,3)=1, (7,4)=?, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (7,3) is 1 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe). So (8,4)=3 has 3 mines in its adjacent cells: (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), and maybe (7,6), (8,6), (9,4) but 9 is invalid. So (8,4) is 3, which means 3 mines in (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6).\n\nBut (7,5)=2, which needs 2 mines in (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). Let's assume (7,4) is a mine. Then (7,5) would have 1 mine there, so needs 1 more in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). (8,4)=3 would have 1 mine in (7,4), so needs 2 more in (7,5) (but (7,5) is a 2, which is safe), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). This is getting complicated.\n\nLet's look for cells that are adjacent to 0. For example, row 4, column 4 is 0 (row 4: [0,1,1,1,0,1,...]). So (4,4)=0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Let's check these:\n\n(3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe). All are uncovered, so that's good.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0 (row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,1,...]). Adjacent cells to (5,4) are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). All of these are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1. All safe, which is consistent.\n\nRow 6, column 3 is 1 (row 6: [0,0,0,1,1,1,...]). Adjacent cells to (6,3) are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (5,2)=0 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe), (6,2)=0 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=? (unknown). So (6,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (7,4). So (7,4) must be a mine! Because all other adjacent cells are safe (uncovered and not mines). So (7,4) is a mine. That's a definite flag.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (6,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,2) = 0 (row 5, col 2: 0) → safe\n(5,3) = 0 (row 5, col 3: 0) → safe\n(5,4) = 0 (row 5, col 4: 0) → safe\n(6,2) = 0 (row 6, col 2: 0) → safe\n(6,4) = 1 (row 6, col 4: 1) → safe (uncovered, number)\n(7,2) = 0 (row 7, col 2: 0) → safe\n(7,3) = 1 (row 7, col 3: 1) → safe (uncovered, number)\n(7,4) = ? (unknown)\n\nSo out of 8 adjacent cells, 7 are safe (not mines). The 1 mine must be in the remaining cell, which is (7,4). Therefore, (7,4) is a mine. So we should flag that.\n\nBut wait, the current flags are 0\/11. Wait, the problem says 10 hidden mines. Oh, maybe the user made a typo in \"Flags: 0\/11\". Anyway, the correct number is 10 mines. So (7,4) is a mine, so we should flag it.\n\nBut let's check another cell to confirm. Let's look at (7,3)=1. Its adjacent cells are (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. All are safe except (7,4). So (7,3)=1 has 1 mine, which must be (7,4). So yes, (7,4) is a mine.\n\nSo the action should be to flag (7,4). But wait, the user's current board shows row 7 as \"0 0 0 1 ? 2 ? ? ? ?\", which probably is row 7: columns 0-8 are [0,0,0,1,?,2,?,?,?]. So (7,4) is column 4, row 7. So the coordinate is (7,4). So the action is 'flag (7,4)'.\n\nWait, but let's check if there's a cell that's definitely safe to uncover. For example, let's look at row 3, column 2: '?'. Is there a way to know if it's safe? Let's see. (3,0) is 1. (3,0) is 1, so adjacent cells have 1 mine. Adjacent to (3,0) are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,1)=2 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe). So (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (2,0) or (2,1). (2,1) is adjacent to (2,2)=2. (2,2)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. If (2,1) is a mine, then (2,2) would have 1 mine there, needing 1 more. But this is not certain.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 5: '?'. (8,4)=3. Adjacent to (8,4) are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=mine (as we determined), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe). So (8,4)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells. We already have (7,4) as a mine, so there are 2 more mines in (7,5) adjacent cells. (7,5)=2, which has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. (7,5) adjacent cells are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (7,4)=mine, (8,4)=3 (safe). So (7,5)=2 has 2 mines: (7,4) and one more in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (8,4)=3 has (7,4) as one mine, and needs 2 more from (7,5) adjacent mines. So (8,5) might be a mine, but not sure.\n\nBut back to the earlier conclusion: (7,4) is definitely a mine. So the action should be to flag (7,4).\n\nAnswer: flag (7,4)","flag (7,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current Minesweeper board and see what information I can get from the revealed numbers. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly to improve the score. \n\nThe current board is a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed here might have a formatting issue. Let me list out the rows properly. Let's index the rows from 0 to 8 (since 9 rows) and columns 0 to 8. Wait, the initial description says the top-left is (0,0), so row 0 is the first line. Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, the first line shows 9 question marks? The user might have made a typo, but maybe it's 9 columns. Let's confirm each row's length. The input shows:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → Maybe that's a typo, perhaps 9 columns. Let's assume each row is 9 cells. Let's list them properly, maybe the user's formatting is off. Let's correct the rows as 9 cells each:\n\nRow 0: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [?, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [1, 2, ?, 1, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 1, F, 2, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] → Wait, 9 rows (0-8), but here there's a row 9. That's a problem. Oh, the user probably made a mistake in the board display. Let's check the original input again. The user wrote:\n\nCurrent Board:\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\n? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\n1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\n0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nThat's 10 rows. Oh, the board is 9x9, so maybe the user made a mistake in the number of rows. Let's assume that it's 9 rows, and perhaps the first row is a typo. Let's proceed with rows 0-8 (9 rows), and each row has 9 columns. Let's index them correctly.\n\nLet's list the cells with their coordinates (row, col):\n\nLooking at Row 7 (since 0-based), which has [0, 0, 0, 1, F, 2, ?, ?, ?]. So (7,4) is flagged (F). \n\nNow, let's look for cells that are uncovered and have numbers, which indicate the number of adjacent mines. Let's check cells with 0, which mean no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells can be safely uncovered.\n\nFor example, in row 2, column 4 is 0 (2,4). The adjacent cells to (2,4) are all safe. Let's list 0 cells:\n\n- (2,4) = 0: adjacent cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Let's check if those are already uncovered. (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1. So (2,5) is 0, which is already uncovered. (3,4)=0, which is in row 3, column 4. Let's check (3,4). (3,4)=0, so its adjacent cells are all safe. The adjacent cells of (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. (4,4)=0, which is another 0. So (4,4)=0. Adjacent cells to (4,4) are (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. Let's check (5,3)=0: adjacent cells (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. (5,2)=0, (6,2)=0. (5,2)=0: adjacent cells (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,3), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3). (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1. (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0. (6,1)=0: adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,0), (6,2), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,2)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=0. All those are 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. \n\nNow, let's look for cells that are still '?' and adjacent to 0s, which can be safely uncovered. For example, (3,2) is '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Let's see the adjacent cells to (3,2):\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1) is '?', row 2, column 2: (2,2)=2, row 2, column 3: (2,3)=1.\n\nRow 3, column 1: (3,1)=2, row 3, column 3: (3,3)=1.\n\nRow 4, column 1: (4,1)=1, row 4, column 2: (4,2)=1, row 4, column 3: (4,3)=1.\n\nThe cell (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)=2. The number 2 at (2,2) means there are 2 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,2):\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nWe know (1,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,1)=2 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered). The other cells: (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,2)=?.\n\nThe 2 at (2,2) has 4 adjacent cells that are uncovered (1,3, 2,3, 3,1, 3,3) which are all safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So the 2 mines must be in the remaining 4 cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nNow, let's look at (3,1)=2. (3,1) is in row 3, column 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\n(3,0)=1 (uncovered), (4,0)=0 (uncovered), (4,1)=1 (uncovered), (4,2)=1 (uncovered), (2,2)=2 (uncovered). The remaining cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,2)=?.\n\nThe 2 at (3,1) means 2 mines in these adjacent cells. (3,0)=1 is a number, so not a mine. (4,0)=0, not a mine. So the 2 mines must be in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nBut from (2,2)=2, which needs 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). Let's see if we can find overlaps. Suppose (3,2) is a mine. Then (3,1)=2 would have one mine in (3,2), so another mine in either (2,0) or (2,1). Then (2,2)=2 would have (3,2) as a mine, so one more mine in (1,1), (1,2), or (2,1). But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a safer cell to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4 is flagged (F). The cell (7,5) is 2. Let's check (7,5)=2. Its adjacent cells are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?.\n\n(6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,4)=F (flagged as mine), (8,4)=3. The 2 at (7,5) means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. Since (7,4) is flagged, if that's a correct flag (mine), then there's 1 mine accounted for. So the remaining 1 mine is in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). But maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nLet's look for 0 cells and their adjacent '?'. For example, (5,0)=0 (row 5, column 0). Its adjacent cells are (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0. All of these are uncovered, so no '?' there. \n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0 (4,4). Its adjacent cells: (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. All uncovered. \n\nRow 3, column 4 is 0 (3,4). Adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. All uncovered. \n\nRow 2, column 5 is 0 (2,5). Adjacent cells: (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. (1,6)=1, (2,6)=1, (3,6)=2 are uncovered. (1,6) is 1: adjacent cells include (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?. The 1 at (1,6) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. Since (1,5)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1 are safe, the mine must be in (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7). But not sure.\n\nLooking for cells that are '?' and adjacent to 0s. For example, (5,6) is '?'. Let's check (5,5)=1 (row 5, column 5). (5,5)=1: adjacent cells (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?.\n\nThe 1 at (5,5) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1 are safe, so the mine is in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 must be safe. Let's check if there are any '?' cells adjacent to 0s that haven't been uncovered yet. \n\nLooking at row 6, column 2 is 0 (6,2). Its adjacent cells are (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1. All adjacent cells are uncovered except maybe none. \n\nRow 7, column 3 is 1 (7,3). Its adjacent cells are (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. (6,2)=0, (7,2)=0, (8,2)=0 are safe, so (7,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The F at (7,4) is a possible mine, so if that's correct, then (7,3)=1's mine is (7,4). So (7,3) is safe.\n\nWait, (7,3)=1: adjacent cells. Let's list them:\n\n(6,2) = 0 → safe\n(6,3) = 1 → safe\n(6,4) = 1 → safe\n(7,2) = 0 → safe\n(7,4) = F → possible mine\n(8,2) = 0 → safe\n(8,3) = 2 → safe\n(8,4) = 3 → safe\n\nSo the only possible mine adjacent to (7,3) is (7,4). Since (7,3)=1, there's exactly 1 mine adjacent, so (7,4) must be a mine. So the flag at (7,4) is correct. That's good, so the user has 1 correct flag (since total mines are 10). \n\nNow, let's look at (8,3)=2 (row 8, column 3). Its adjacent cells are (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0 (if row 9 exists, but maybe row 8 is the last). Wait, original board has 10 rows, which is a mistake. Let's assume it's 9 rows (0-8), so row 8 is the last. Then (8,3)=2's adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,3) is (8,3), so adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) but row 9 doesn't exist. So (8,3) has adjacent cells (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (8,3's row 8, columns 2-4, and row 7, columns 2-4). So (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3. So (8,3)=2: the number of mines here is 2. The F at (7,4) is a mine, so that's 1. The 3 at (8,4) might have mines around it. \n\nLooking at (8,4)=3 (row 8, column 4). Adjacent cells: (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1 (if row 9 exists), (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. Assuming row 8 is last, then (8,4)=3's adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (8,4) is center. So (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2. So (8,4)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells. The F at (7,4) is 1 mine. (7,5)=2: adjacent cells include (7,4)=F, so if (7,5)=2, then there's 1 more mine in its adjacent cells. (7,5) is row 7, column 5: adjacent cells (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?. So (7,5)=2: 2 mines. Since (7,4)=F is 1, there's 1 more mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). \n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. Let's look for cells that are '?' and are adjacent to 0s. For example, (3,4) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. Wait, (3,4) is 0. Let's check (3,4)'s adjacent cells. (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Its adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). All of these are uncovered (numbers 0 or 1), so no '?' there. \n\nWhat about (4,6)? (4,6) is in row 4, column 6. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=?. (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1 are uncovered. The 2 at (3,6) (row 3, column 6) has adjacent cells: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?. The 2 at (3,6) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (2,5)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1 are safe, so mines are in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). \n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 must be safe. Let's check (5,6): row 5, column 6. What's adjacent to (5,6)? (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=?. (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,5)=1 are safe, so no info from 0s here.\n\nWait, let's check row 0. All cells in row 0 are '?'. Maybe there's a way to find mines there, but without any adjacent numbers, it's hard. \n\nAnother angle: the user's score is 0.0909..., which is 1\/11, meaning they have 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged (but the problem says \"Flags: 1\/11\", which might mean they flagged 11 cells, 1 correct). The total mines are 10, so they have 1 correct flag and 10 incorrect flags. So they need to unflag the incorrect ones, but the current action could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (3,2) is '?'. Let's check (3,2)'s adjacent cells. (3,1)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,1)=?, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1. The (3,1)=2 has adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (3,0)=1 (row 3, column 0) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (3,1)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (3,0)=1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (4,0)=0 is safe, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1 are safe, (3,1)=2 is safe, (2,2)=2 is safe. So the mine is in (2,0) or (2,1). \n\n(2,2)=2: adjacent cells (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1. (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1 are safe. So 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). \n\nIf (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (2,0) or (2,1), and (2,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), then if (2,1) is a mine, that would count for both (3,0)=1 and (2,2)=2. Let's say (2,1) is a mine: then (3,0)=1's mine is (2,1), and (2,2)=2's mines include (2,1) and one more in (1,1), (1,2), or (3,2). Then (3,1)=2 (row 3, column 1) has adjacent cells (2,0)=?, (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1)=2 has 2 mines: (2,1) and one more in (2,0) or (3,2). If (2,1) is a mine, then (3,1)=2 needs another mine. If (2,0) is a mine, then (3,0)=1's mine is (2,0), and (2,1) is safe. Then (2,2)=2's mines would be in (1,1), (1,2), (3,2). This is getting too speculative.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5)=1, but (5,5) is 1, not 0. What about (6,6)? (6,5)=1, (6,6) is '?'. (6,5)=1's adjacent cells are (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?. (5,4)=0 is safe, so (6,5)=1 has 1 mine in (5,6), (6,6), (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6). Since (7,4)=F is a mine, that's 1, so (6,5)=1's mine is (7,4). So (6,5)=1 is safe, so (6,6) is safe? Not necessarily. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are '?' and have all adjacent cells with numbers that allow us to determine they are safe. For example, (3,4) is 0, but all adjacent cells are uncovered. \n\nWait, looking at row 3, column 2: (3,2) is '?'. Let's check (2,2)=2. (2,2) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). We know (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1 are all safe (not mines). So the 2 mines must be in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). Now, (3,1)=2 has adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). We know (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1 are safe. So (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). \n\nIf (3,2) is a mine, then (3,1)=2 has one mine there, so another mine in (2,0) or (2,1). Then (2,2)=2 has one mine in (3,2), so another mine in (1,1), (1,2), or (2,1). If (2,1) is a mine, then (3,1)=2 has (2,1) and (3,2) as mines, but that would be 2 mines, which matches (3,1)=2. Then (2,2)=2 would have (2,1) and (3,2) as mines, which also matches. So that's possible. But we can't be sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, (5,6) is adjacent to (5,5)=1, but (5,5) is 1. (6,6) is adjacent to (6,5)=1. (7,6) is adjacent to (7,5)=2. (8,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3. \n\nWait, let's check (4,6). (4,6) is in row 4, column 6. Its adjacent cells are (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=?. (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1 are safe. (3,6)=2: adjacent cells (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?. (2,5)=0 is safe, so (3,6)=2 has 2 mines in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). If (4,6) is safe, then (3,6)=2's mines are in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). But we don't know.\n\nMaybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, (5,6) is not adjacent to a 0. What about (6,6)? (6,6) is adjacent to (6,5)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,5)=2. No 0s there. \n\nWait, let's look at row 8, column 5 (8,5). It's '?'. Adjacent cells are (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=?, (9,4)=? (if row 9 exists). Assuming row 8 is last, (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=?. (7,4)=F is a mine, (7,5)=2 has 2 mines (one is F, so one more), (8,4)=3 has 3 mines (one is F, so two more). So (8,5) could be a mine, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the initial moves. The user has to uncover a safe cell. The best bet is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which are all safe. Let's check (3,2) again. No, (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)=2, which has mines. \n\nWait, (5,6) is in row 5, column 6. Let's check the cell (5,6). What's the value of (5,5)=1. (5,5)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?. (4,4)=0 and (5,4)=0 are safe, so (5,5)=1's mine is in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). If (5,6) is safe, then the mine is in (4,6) or (6,6). But we can't be sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are '?' and have all adjacent numbers that sum up to the number of possible mines, indicating the cell is safe. For example, if a '?' is adjacent to a 1, and that 1 already has a flagged mine, then the '?' is safe. Let's check (7,6) (row 7, column 6). (7,5)=2 (row7, col5) has 2 mines. (7,4)=F is one mine, so there's 1 more mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,6) could be a mine or safe. \n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,2) again. If (3,2) is uncovered and it's a number, that might give more info. But if it's a mine, the game ends. So we need to find a cell that's definitely safe. \n\nWait, let's look at (4,6). (4,5)=1 (row4, col5). (4,5)=1's adjacent cells are (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=?. (3,4)=0 and (4,4)=0 and (5,4)=0 are safe, so (4,5)=1's mine is in (3,5)=1 (no, 1 is a number), (3,6)=2 (number), (4,6)=?, (5,5)=1 (number), (5,6)=?. So the mine is in (4,6) or (5,6). So (4,6) could be a mine. \n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, (5,6) is not adjacent to a 0, but (5,5)=1. What about (2,1)? (2,1) is '?'. Adjacent to (2,2)=2, which needs 2 mines. If (2,1) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 has one mine there. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are in the \"safe zone\" of 0s. The 0s in the lower-left area (rows 4-8, columns 0-4) are all 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (5,6) is outside that zone. \n\nWait, (3,4) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. But they are already uncovered. What about (2,5)=0, adjacent cells are (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. All uncovered. \n\nMaybe the safest cell to uncover is (3,2). Let's see why. (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Let's check the adjacent cells again. (3,1)=2, which has 2 mines. If (3,2) is safe, then (3,1)=2's mines are in (2,0) and (2,1). (2,2)=2's mines would be in (1,1) and (1,2). That's possible. So (3,2) could be safe. \n\nAlternatively, let's check (1,6)=1 (row1, col6). (1,6)=1's adjacent cells are (0,5)=?, (0,6)=?, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?. (1,5)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1 are safe, so the mine is in (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7). So (1,6)=1's adjacent '?' cells are all possible mines, but we can't be sure. \n\nI think the best move here is to uncover (3,2) because it's a '?' cell that might be safe based on the numbers around it. Alternatively, maybe (3,2) is a mine, but I have to take a chance. Alternatively, let's see if there's a cell that is definitely safe. \n\nWait, (5,6) is '?'. Let's check (5,5)=1. (5,5)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=?. So the mine is in (4,6), (5,6), (6,6). If (5,6) is safe, then the mine is in (4,6) or (6,6). But we don't know. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at (6,6). (6,5)=1 (row6, col5). (6,5)=1's adjacent cells are (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (safe), (7,6)=?. So (6,5)=1 has 1 mine, which is (7,4)=F. So the other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) are safe! Because (6,5)=1's only mine is (7,4). So (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) are safe. That's a key insight. \n\nLet me explain: (6,5) is 1, which means there's exactly 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(5,4) = 0 → safe\n(5,5) = 1 → safe (since it's a number, not a mine)\n(5,6) = ?\n(6,4) = 1 → safe\n(6,6) = ?\n(7,4) = F → flagged as mine\n(7,5) = 2 → safe (number)\n(7,6) = ?\n\nSince (7,4) is flagged as a mine, and (6,5)=1, that means there's exactly 1 mine in the adjacent cells. Since (7,4) is a mine, that's the only mine. Therefore, all other adjacent cells to (6,5) must be safe. So (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) are safe. That's a sure thing! \n\nSo (5,6) is safe. Let's confirm: (6,5)=1 has 1 mine, which is (7,4). Therefore, (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) cannot be mines. So uncovering (5,6) is safe. \n\nYes, that makes sense. So the action should be to uncover (5,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,6)","uncover (5,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the rules. The board is 9x9, but looking at the current board provided, there are 10 rows listed. Wait, maybe that's a typo, but maybe it's 10 rows? Wait, the problem says 9x9 grid, so perhaps the current board is displayed with 10 rows by mistake, but maybe I should focus on the cells given.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10. Right now, the score is 0.0909..., which is 1\/11, but wait, total mines are 10. Oh, the note says \"Flags: 1\/11\"—maybe that's 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged? But the total mines are 10, so having 11 flags would mean some are incorrect. The user has 1 correct flag so far.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse each row. Let's index rows from 0 to 9 (since there are 10 rows listed, maybe the original 9x9 was a mistake, or perhaps the display is off). Let's list each row with their positions (row, col):\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9 (10 columns)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? → cols 0-8 (9 columns)\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? → cols 0-8\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? → cols 0-8\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? → cols 0-8\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9 (F at (7,4))\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? → cols 0-9\n\nWait, maybe the board is actually 10x10? The problem statement might have a typo. But regardless, let's focus on the cells with numbers and flags.\n\nFirst, the flagged cell is at (7,4) with an 'F'. Let's check the adjacent cells to see if that flag is correct. The cell (7,4) is in row 7, column 4. Let's look at the surrounding cells. For example, the cell to the right is (7,5) which is '2'. Let's check the cell (7,5): it's a '2', meaning it has two adjacent mines. The adjacent cells to (7,5) are:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6),\n(7,4), (7,6),\n(8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\nSo (7,5) is a 2. The cell (7,4) is flagged (F), so if that's a mine, then (7,5) has at least one mine. Let's see other cells around (7,5). The cell (8,4) is '3', which is in row 8, column 4. Let's check (8,4): it's a 3, so it has three adjacent mines. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n(8,3) is '2', (8,4) is '3', (8,5) is '?'. (7,3) is '1', (7,4) is 'F', (7,5) is '2'. (9,3) is '1', (9,4) is '?', (9,5) is '?'.\n\nIf (7,4) is a mine (flagged correctly), then (8,4) has that as one mine. Let's see (8,3) is '2'. (8,3) is in row 8, column 3. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n(7,2) is '0' (row 7, column 2: row 7 is \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\", so (7,2) is 0), (7,3) is 1, (7,4) is F. (8,2) is 0 (row 8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\" → (8,2)=0), (8,4)=3. (9,2)=0 (row 9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → (9,2)=0), (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?.\n\nSo (8,3) is '2', which means two adjacent mines. The adjacent cells that are possible mines are (7,4) (F), (8,4) (3 is a number, not a mine), (9,4) (unknown). (7,3) is 1 (safe, since it's a number), (7,2) is 0 (safe), (8,2) is 0 (safe), (9,2) is 0 (safe), (9,3) is 1 (safe). So the possible mines for (8,3) are (7,4) and (9,4). Since (8,3) is 2, there must be two mines in those adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine (flagged), then (9,4) must also be a mine. That's a possibility.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover. Safe cells are those that are either 0 (which when uncovered, all adjacent cells are automatically uncovered) or cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". The cell (3,4) is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (3,4): row 3, column 4. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\n(2,3) is 1 (row 2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\" → (2,3)=1), (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" → (4,3)=1), (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. All these are numbers (1, 0, 1, etc.), which are safe. So (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered (since it's a number). Wait, no: the 0 in (3,4) is a number, meaning it's already been uncovered. So any adjacent cells to a 0 that are still '?' can be uncovered safely. Let's check the adjacent cells of (3,4) that are '?'.\n\n(3,4) is 0. The adjacent cells are (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,4)=0 (uncovered), (2,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=1 (uncovered), (4,3)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,5)=1 (uncovered). So all adjacent cells to (3,4) are already uncovered. So no help there.\n\nLet's look at row 2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". The cell (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0. So their adjacent cells should be safe. Let's check (2,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(1,3)=1 (row 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\" → (1,3)=1), (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1. All uncovered, so no new cells here.\n\nRow 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\". (4,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,5),\n(5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\n(3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0 (row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\" → (5,3)=0), (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. All uncovered, so no new cells.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\". (5,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5),\n(5,3), (5,5),\n(6,3), (6,4), (6,5)\n\n(4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1 (row6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\" → (6,3)=1), (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\". Let's check (6,3)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(5,2), (5,3), (5,4),\n(6,2), (6,4),\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4)\n\n(5,2)=0 (row5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1... → (5,2)=0), (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0 (row6: 0 0 0 1... → (6,2)=0), (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0 (row7: 0 0 0 1 F... → (7,2)=0), (7,3)=1 (row7: (7,3)=1), (7,4)=F. So (6,3) is 1, which has adjacent cells. The possible mines here would be in the adjacent cells that are unknown. But all adjacent cells are either 0, 1, or F. So (6,3) is 1, and the F at (7,4) is adjacent. If (7,4) is a mine, then (6,3) has one mine, which matches the 1. That's consistent.\n\nLooking at row 7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\". (7,5)=2. Let's check (7,5)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6),\n(7,4), (7,6),\n(8,4), (8,5), (8,6)\n\n(6,4)=1 (row6: 0 0 0 1 1 1... → (6,4)=1), (6,5)=1, (6,6)=? (row6: (6,6) is '?'), (7,4)=F, (7,6)=? (row7: (7,6) is '?'), (8,4)=3 (row8: 0 0 0 2 3... → (8,4)=3), (8,5)=? (row8: (8,5) is '?'), (8,6)=? (row8: (8,6) is '?'). So (7,5) is 2. The known adjacent cells: (7,4) is F (potential mine), (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe). The unknown cells are (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,5) needs two mines in its adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine (1), then there's one more mine in the remaining four cells.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\". (8,3)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4)\n\n(7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,3)=1 (row9: 0 0 0 1... → (9,3)=1), (9,4)=? (row9: (9,4) is '?'). So (8,3)=2. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (7,4)=F and (9,4)=?. If (7,4) is a mine, then (9,4) must be a mine to make the total 2. Because (8,3) is 2, so two mines in adjacent cells. The other cells are safe (0 or 1). So (9,4) is a mine? Maybe.\n\n(8,4)=3. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3), (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5)\n\n(7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. So (8,4)=3. The known adjacent cells: (7,4)=F (potential mine), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So the possible mines are (7,4), (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). If (7,4) is a mine (1), then we need two more mines in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5) to reach 3.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\". (9,3)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,4),\n(10,2) [invalid], (10,3) [invalid], (10,4) [invalid]\n\nAssuming the grid is 9x9, row 9 is the last row, so (9,3) adjacent cells are (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=?. So (9,3)=1. The adjacent cells that could be mines: (9,4)=? (since others are 0, 2, 3 which are safe). So (9,3) is 1, meaning one mine in adjacent cells. The only possible mine is (9,4). So if (9,4) is a mine, that matches. Which aligns with the earlier thought from (8,3)=2 needing (9,4) as a mine.\n\nSo (9,4) is likely a mine. But we need to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s, which are guaranteed safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 that is still '?' can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0: all '?'. Not helpful.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". The 1s here are in columns 3-6. Let's check (1,3)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n(1,2), (1,4),\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4)\n\n(0,2)=?, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=2 (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1... → (2,2)=2), (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0. So (1,3)=1. The 0 at (2,4) is adjacent, which is safe. So (1,3) has one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2). But since (2,4) is 0, all its adjacent cells are safe, so (1,4) is 1 (safe), (2,3) is 1 (safe), etc. Not sure.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n(2,1), (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3)\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2 (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2... → (3,1)=2), (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1. So (2,2)=2. It needs two mines in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1. The unknowns are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). So two of these are mines.\n\nRow 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". (3,2)=? (row3, column2). Let's check adjacent cells to (3,2). (3,2) is in row3, column2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,3),\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1 (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1... → (4,1)=1), (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1. So (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)=2, (3,1)=2, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, etc. If (3,2) is a number, it's the count of mines around it. But since it's '?', maybe we can find if it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 4, column 0: (4,0)=0. Adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0)=1 (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2... → (3,0)=1), (3,1)=2, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=0 (row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1... → (5,0)=0), (5,1)=0. All these are numbers, so (4,0)=0 is already processed.\n\nRow 5, column 0: (5,0)=0. Adjacent cells (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=0, (6,0)=0 (row6: \"0 0 0 1... → (6,0)=0), (6,1)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 6, column 0: (6,0)=0. Adjacent cells (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=0 (row7: \"0 0 0 1 F... → (7,0)=0), (7,1)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 7, column 0: (7,0)=0. Adjacent cells (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,0)=0 (row8: \"0 0 0 2 3... → (8,0)=0), (8,1)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 8, column 0: (8,0)=0. Adjacent cells (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,1)=0, (9,0)=0 (row9: \"0 0 0 1... → (9,0)=0), (9,1)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 9, column 0: (9,0)=0. Adjacent cells (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (9,1)=0. All safe.\n\nSo the leftmost columns (0-2) in rows 4-9 are all 0s or 1s, already uncovered.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 4: (3,4)=0. As before, all adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 4: (4,4)=0. Same.\n\nRow 5, column 4: (5,4)=0. Same.\n\nSo the central area around (3,4) to (5,4) is all 0s and 1s, already uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for a '0' that has adjacent '?' cells. For example, row 2, column 4: (2,4)=0. Adjacent cells are (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 5: (2,5)=0. Adjacent cells (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1 (row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1... → (1,6)=1), (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1 (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1... → (2,6)=1), (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2 (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2... → (3,6)=2). All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 5: (3,5)=1. Adjacent cells (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=? (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ?... → (4,6)=?). So (3,5)=1. The adjacent cell (4,6) is '?'. Let's check (3,5)=1: it has one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are safe: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,4)=0. The other adjacent cells: (2,6)=1 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine adjacent to (3,5) would be (4,6). But (3,5) is 1, so if (4,6) is a mine, that would make sense. But maybe (4,6) is safe. Wait, (3,6)=2. Let's check (3,6)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5), (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n\n(2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=? (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ?... → (2,7)=?), (3,5)=1, (3,7)=? (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ?... → (3,7)=?), (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=? (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ?... → (4,7)=?). So (3,6)=2 needs two mines in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (2,5)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1. The unknowns: (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). So two mines among these.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell has a number equal to the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's check if any number cell has adjacent flags equal to its number.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 3: (7,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. So (7,3)=1. It has one adjacent flag (F at (7,4)). So if (7,4) is a mine, then (7,3) has exactly one mine, which matches the 1. So that's correct. So the flag at (7,4) is likely correct (so that's the one correct flag contributing to the score).\n\nNow, let's see if there are any cells where the number of adjacent flags is equal to the cell's number, meaning the other adjacent cells are safe. For example, if a cell is '2' and has two adjacent flags, then the rest are safe. But I don't see such a case here.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells that are adjacent to a 0, which are safe. Wait, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe, but if those adjacent cells are already uncovered, then look for cells adjacent to 1s, 2s, etc., where the count can be determined.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends if we uncover a mine, so we need to avoid that. So we should uncover cells that are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered. Its adjacent cells are all uncovered, so no help.\n\nRow 4, column 4: 0, same.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 0, same.\n\nRow 5, column 3: 0. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 2: 0. Adjacent cells: (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1. All uncovered.\n\nHow about row 1, column 6: (1,6)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,5), (0,6), (0,7),\n(1,5)=1, (1,7)=?,\n(2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?\n\n(1,6)=1. The adjacent cells that are safe: (1,5)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. The unknowns: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7). So (1,6)=1 has one mine in those. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 2: (3,2)=? (row3, column2). Let's check the cell (2,2)=2 (row2, column2). (2,2) has adjacent cells including (3,2). (2,2)=2, so it has two mines in its adjacent cells. Let's list (2,2)'s adjacent cells again:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)=1,\n(2,1), (2,3)=1,\n(3,1)=2, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1.\n\nSo (2,2) has two mines. The known safe cells: (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1. So the possible mines are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). So two of these four are mines.\n\nNow, (3,1)=2 (row3, column1). Let's check (3,1)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2,\n(3,0)=1, (3,2)=?,\n(4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\nSo (3,1)=2 has two mines in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (3,0)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. The unknowns: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2, (3,2)=?.\n\n(2,2)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So the possible mines for (3,1)=2 are (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). So two mines in these three.\n\nIf (3,1)=2 needs two mines from (2,0), (2,1), (3,2), and (2,2)=2 needs two mines from (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), perhaps there's overlap.\n\nSuppose (3,2) is a mine. Then (3,1)=2 would need one more mine from (2,0) or (2,1). And (2,2)=2 would need one more mine from (1,1) or (1,2). That's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,2) is not a mine, then (3,1)=2 needs two mines from (2,0) and (2,1), and (2,2)=2 needs two mines from (1,1) and (1,2). That's also possible.\n\nBut we can't be sure, so (3,2) might be a mine or safe. Not helpful.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is still '?'. Wait, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe, but if those are already uncovered, then look for cells adjacent to 1s where the 1 has only one possible mine, meaning the rest are safe.\n\nFor example, row 9, column 3: (9,3)=1. Adjacent cells are (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0, (9,4)=?. As (9,3)=1, and the only unknown adjacent cell is (9,4), which must be a mine (since 1 mine is needed). So (9,4) is a mine. Therefore, we shouldn't uncover (9,4); instead, we should flag it. But the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag. But maybe there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAnother example: row 7, column 3: (7,3)=1. Adjacent cells are (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. Since (7,3)=1 and there's one flag (F) adjacent, which is a mine, then (7,3) is satisfied. So no other mines there.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 6: (6,6)=? (row6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ?... → (6,6)=?). Let's check the cell (5,6)=1 (row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1... → (5,6)=1). (5,6)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?,\n(5,5)=1, (5,7)=?,\n(6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=?\n\nSo (5,6)=1 needs one mine in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,5)=1. The unknowns: (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7). So one mine among these.\n\n(6,5)=1 (row6, column5) has adjacent cells:\n\n(5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1,\n(6,4)=1, (6,6)=?,\n(7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?\n\n(6,5)=1 needs one mine. The adjacent cells: (5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (safe). So (6,5)=1 has one mine (F at (7,4)), which matches. So (6,5)=1 is satisfied.\n\nBack to (5,6)=1: since (6,5)=1 is satisfied by (7,4) being a mine, (5,6)=1's mine could be in (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7). Not sure.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 4 is 0, but all adjacent are uncovered. What about row 4, column 6: (4,6)=? (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ?... → (4,6)=?). Let's check (3,6)=2 (row3, column6=2). (3,6)=2's adjacent cells include (4,6). (3,6)=2 has adjacent cells: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?. So (3,6)=2 needs two mines. If (4,6) is safe, then two mines must be in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 5: (8,5)=? (row8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ?... → (8,5)=?). (8,4)=3 (row8, column4=3) has adjacent cells including (8,5). (8,4)=3 needs three mines. If (7,4)=F is a mine (1), then (8,5), (9,4), (9,5) could have two more mines. But (9,4) is likely a mine (from (8,3)=2 and (9,3)=1), so (9,4) is a mine (2), then (8,5) or (9,5) is the third. So (8,5) might be a mine or not.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is still '?'. Wait, 0 cells have all adjacent cells safe, but if those are already uncovered, then look for cells that are in the \"expanded\" area of 0s. For example, in Minesweeper, when you uncover a 0, all adjacent cells are uncovered, and if they are 0, their adjacent cells are uncovered, etc. So the area around 0s is all safe and uncovered. The '?' cells are outside this area.\n\nLooking at the board, the left side (columns 0-2) in rows 4-9 are all 0s and 1s, already uncovered. The central area (columns 3-5) in rows 2-6 are 0s and 1s, uncovered. The '?' cells are mostly in the top-left (rows 0-2, columns 0-2), top-right (rows 0-3, columns 7-9), bottom-right (rows 4-9, columns 6-9), and some in row3, column2.\n\nLet's check row 3, column 2: (3,2)=? (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2...\"). The cell (3,1)=2 (row3, column1=2). (3,1)=2's adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1)=2 has two mines. (3,0)=1 is a number (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So the possible mines are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=?. So two mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nIf (3,2) is safe (not a mine), then (2,0) and (2,1) must be mines. If (3,2) is a mine, then one of (2,0) or (2,1) is a mine.\n\nBut we can't be sure. However, maybe (3,2) is safe. Let's assume that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 0, column 4: (0,4)=? (row0: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\"). Adjacent to row1, column4=1 (row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1... → (1,4)=1). (1,4)=1's adjacent cells include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. So (1,4)=1 has one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are safe: (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. So the possible mines are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). So one of these three is a mine. So (0,4) has a 1\/3 chance of being a mine. Not safe.\n\nAnother cell: row 1, column 2: (1,2)=? (row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1... → (1,2)=?). Adjacent to (2,2)=2 (row2, column2=2). (2,2)=2's adjacent cells include (1,2). (2,2)=2 has two mines. So (1,2) could be a mine or not.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the best bet is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is likely safe. Wait, all 0-adjacent cells are already uncovered. So maybe the next best is to uncover a cell that is in an area with known numbers that indicate it's safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 6: (4,6)=? (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ?...\"). Let's check (4,5)=1 (row4, column5=1). (4,5)=1's adjacent cells are (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. So (4,5)=1 has one mine. The adjacent cells that are safe: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. The unknowns: (3,6)=2, (4,6)=?. (3,6)=2 is a number (safe), so the only possible mine is (4,6). So (4,5)=1 has one mine, which is (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover (4,6).\n\nWait, (4,5)=1: adjacent cells. (3,6)=2 is a number, so it's safe. So the adjacent cells to (4,5) are:\n\n(3,4)=0 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe),\n(4,4)=0 (safe), (4,6)=? (unknown),\n(5,4)=0 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe).\n\nSo (4,5)=1 needs one mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) must be a mine. So (4,6) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover it.\n\nHow about row 3, column 7: (3,7)=? (row3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ?... → (3,7)=?). Let's check (3,6)=2 (row3, column6=2). (3,6)=2's adjacent cells are (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?. (3,6)=2 needs two mines. We know (4,6) is a mine (from above), so that's one. So (3,6)=2 needs one more mine in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). So (3,7) has a chance of being a mine.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the best approach is to find a cell that is in the 0-expanded area, but all those are already uncovered. So perhaps the next step is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 1 with only one possible mine, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at row 7, column 6: (7,6)=? (row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ?... → (7,6)=?). The cell (7,5)=2 (row7, column5=2) has adjacent cells including (7,6). (7,5)=2 needs two mines. (7,4)=F is a mine (1), so (7,5)=2 needs one more mine in (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=?, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?. So the possible mines are (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,6) might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is in a corner with many 0s. For example, row 9, column 5: (9,5)=? (row9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ?... → (9,5)=?). Adjacent to (9,3)=1 (row9, column3=1), which we think (9,4) is a mine. (9,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3 (row8, column4=3), which needs three mines. If (9,4) is a mine (1), (8,5)=? (2), (9,5)=? (3), then (8,4)=3 could have those three. So (9,5) might be a mine.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the safest cell to uncover is one that is adjacent to a 0 and is in the expanded area, but I don't see any. Alternatively, maybe the cell (3,4) is already uncovered, but wait, (3,4) is 0, which is already uncovered.\n\nWait, looking back at the current board, row 3 is \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". So (3,4) is 0, which is uncovered. The cell (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Its adjacent cells are all uncovered, as we checked before.\n\nAnother idea: the user has 1 correct flag out of 11, which is bad. The total mines are 10, so there's 1 correct flag and 10 incorrect flags. So the F at (7,4) is the correct one. The other 10 flags are incorrect. But the current board shows only one F: (7,4). So maybe the \"Flags: 1\/11\" means 1 correct flag and 11 total flags (so 10 incorrect). But the board displayed only has one F. Maybe the board display is truncated, but according to the given current board, only (7,4) is flagged. So perhaps the 11 flags are a mistake, but regardless, the correct flag is (7,4).\n\nTo win, we need to flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. Since uncovering all safe cells is an option, maybe we can find a safe cell to uncover.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is a '?' and is adjacent to a 0. But all 0-adjacent cells are already uncovered. How about a cell adjacent to a 1 where the 1 has all other adjacent cells uncovered except one, meaning that cell is safe.\n\nFor example, row 2, column 6: (2,6)=1 (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1... → (2,6)=1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?,\n(2,5)=0, (2,7)=?,\n(3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?\n\n(2,6)=1 has one mine. The known safe cells: (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. The unknowns: (1,7), (2,7), (3,7). So one mine among these. So (1,7), (2,7), (3,7) each have a 1\/3 chance of being a mine. Not safe.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 7: (1,7)=? (row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ?... → (1,7)=?). Adjacent to (1,6)=1 (row1, column6=1), which has one mine. (1,6)=1's adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?. So (1,6)=1 has one mine in (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7). So (1,7) has a 1\/5 chance. Still risky.\n\nI think I need to pick a cell that is likely safe. Let's look at row 3, column 2: (3,2)=? (row3, column2). The cell (3,0)=1 (row3, column0=1). (3,0)=1's adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2, (3,1)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,0)=1 has one mine. The known safe cells: (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (3,1)=2 (number), (2,2)=2 (number). So the possible mine is (2,0) or (2,1). So (3,0)=1 has one mine in (2,0) or (2,1). So (3,2) is not adjacent to (3,0), so maybe (3,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick (3,4) but it's already uncovered. Wait, no, (3,4) is 0, which is uncovered. What about (4,6)? We thought it might be a mine, so avoid. (7,6)? Maybe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 6, column 6: (6,6)=? (row6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 ?... → (6,6)=?). Adjacent to (5,6)=1 (row5, column6=1), which has one mine. (5,6)=1's adjacent cells are (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=?. So (5,6)=1 has one mine in those. If (4,6) is a mine (from earlier), then (5,6)=1's mine is (4,6), so (6,6) is safe. So (6,6) is safe. Let's uncover (6,6).\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (6,6)","uncover (6,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules and the current state of the board. The goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is based on correct flags over total mines (10), and right now the user has 1 correct flag out of 11 flagged, which might mean some flags are wrong.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse it row by row. The coordinates are (row, col), with (0,0) being top-left. The rows are numbered 0 to 9 (since it's a 9x9 grid, wait, wait—the user wrote \"9x9 grid\" but the current board has 10 elements per row. That's a typo, probably. Let's assume it's 9 rows, each with 9 columns. Maybe the way it's displayed here has a formatting error, like extra spaces. Let's check the rows:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? → Maybe 9 columns, so 9 elements. Maybe the extra space is a mistake. Let's focus on the numbers.\n\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? → Columns 3-6 are 1s.\n\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? → Columns 2 is 2, 3 is 1, 4-5 are 0, 6 is 1.\n\nRow 3: 1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? → Column 0 is 1, 1 is 2, 2 is ?, 3 is 1, 4 is 0, 5 is 1, 6 is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ? → Columns 0-1: 0, 1; 2-3:1; 4:0; 5:1; 6:?\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ? → Columns 0-4: 0s; 5-6:1.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? → Columns 3:1, 4-6:1.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ? → Column 4 is F (flagged), 5 is 2.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? → Column 3:2, 4:3.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? → Column 3:1.\n\nFirst, let's note that 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe. So any cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's look for 0s.\n\nRow 2, columns 4 and 5 are 0. So their adjacent cells are safe. Let's list the 0s:\n\nRow 2, (2,4) and (2,5) are 0. Let's check their adjacent cells. The 8 surrounding cells of (2,4):\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5) [itself], (2,5) is 0, (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But (2,4) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's check which of those are still covered (marked as ?).\n\n(1,3) is 1 (already uncovered), (1,4) is 1 (uncovered), (1,5) is 1 (uncovered), (2,3) is 1 (uncovered), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (3,4) is 0 (uncovered), (3,5) is 1 (uncovered). So all adjacent to (2,4) are already uncovered. Similarly, (2,5) is 0. Its adjacent cells: (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1 (row 1, column 6 is 1), (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1 (row 2, column 6 is 1), (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2 (row 3, column 6 is 2). All those are uncovered except maybe (1,6) is 1, which is already a number. So 0s here don't give new safe cells.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1 (row 4, column 3 is 1), (4,4)=0 (row 4, column 4 is 0), (4,5)=1 (row 4, column 5 is 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0 (row 5, column 3 is 0), (5,4)=0 (row 5, column 4 is 0), (5,5)=1 (row 5, column 5 is 1). All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-4 are 0s. Let's take (5,0): 0. Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,0)=0 (row 4, column 0 is 0), (4,1)=1 (row 4, column 1 is 1), (5,1)=0 (row 5, column 1 is 0), (6,0)=0 (row 6, column 0 is 0), (6,1)=0 (row 6, column 1 is 0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, columns 0-2 are 0s. (6,0)=0, adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=0 (row 7, column 0 is 0), (7,1)=0 (row 7, column 1 is 0). All uncovered.\n\nSo 0s don't help here. Let's look for cells that must be safe or must be mines.\n\nLet's take row 7, column 4 is flagged (F). The cell (7,5) is 2. So (7,5) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (7,5) are:\n\n(6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6).\n\nWe know (7,4) is F (flagged as mine). So the 2 mines in (7,5)'s neighbors include that F. So there's 1 more mine among the other 7 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(6,4): row 6, column 4. The row 6 is \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\", so column 4 is 1 (already uncovered). 1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. So (6,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5). (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3 is 1), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2. So (6,4)=1. The 1 mine here is (7,4) (F). So that's correct.\n\n(6,5): row 6, column 5 is 1 (uncovered). Its adjacent cells: (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6). (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1 (row 5, column 6 is 1), (6,4)=1, (6,6)=1 (row 6, column 6 is 1), (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=? (unknown). So (6,5)=1. The mine here is (7,4) (F). So that's 1 mine, which matches.\n\n(6,6): row 6, column 6 is 1 (uncovered). Its adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=? (row 5, column 7 is ?), (6,5)=1, (6,7)=? (row 6, column 7 is ?), (7,5)=2, (7,6)=? (row 7, column 6 is ?), (7,7)=? (row 7, column 7 is ?). (6,6)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. Could be (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7), (5,6) is 1 (uncovered, so not a mine).\n\n(7,6): ? (unknown). Part of (7,5)'s adjacent cells.\n\n(8,4): row 8, column 4 is 3 (uncovered). Let's look at (8,4)=3. Its adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,3)=1 (row 7, column 3 is 1), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2 (row 8, column 3 is 2), (8,5)=? (unknown), (9,3)=1 (row 9, column 3 is 1), (9,4)=? (unknown), (9,5)=? (unknown). So (8,4)=3 means 3 mines in these 8 cells. We already have (7,4) as a mine (F). So 2 more mines here. (7,3) is 1 (not a mine), (7,5)=2 (not a mine), (8,3)=2 (not a mine), (9,3)=1 (not a mine). So possible mines in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5).\n\n(8,3)=2: row 8, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,2)=0 (row 7, column 2 is 0), (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0 (row 8, column 2 is 0), (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0 (row 9, column 2 is 0), (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?. So (8,3)=2: 2 mines in adjacent cells. (7,4)=F is one, so one more. Possible (9,4) or others. But (7,2)=0, (8,2)=0, (9,2)=0: those are safe, so not mines. So (8,3)=2 has mines at (7,4) and maybe (9,4).\n\nRow 3, column 2 is ? (unknown). Let's check the cell (3,2). The surrounding cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=? (row 2, column 1 is ?), (2,2)=2 (row 2, column 2 is 2), (2,3)=1 (row 2, column 3 is 1), (3,1)=2 (row 3, column 1 is 2), (3,3)=1 (row 3, column 3 is 1), (4,1)=1 (row 4, column 1 is 1), (4,2)=1 (row 4, column 2 is 1), (4,3)=1 (row 4, column 3 is 1). \n\n(3,1)=2: adjacent cells to (3,1) are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0)=? (row 2, column 0 is ?), (2,1)=? (row 2, column 1 is ?), (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1 (row 3, column 0 is 1), (3,2)=?, (4,0)=0 (row 4, column 0 is 0), (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in these cells. (4,0)=0 is safe, (3,0)=1 is safe, (4,1)=1 and (4,2)=1 are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So possible mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). (2,2)=2 is a number, so not a mine. So 2 mines among (2,0), (2,1), (3,2).\n\n(2,2)=2: adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=? (row 1, column 1 is ?), (1,2)=? (row 1, column 2 is ?), (1,3)=1 (row 1, column 3 is 1), (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=1. (1,3)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1 are numbers, not mines. So (2,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2).\n\nSo (3,1)=2 and (2,2)=2 both have (2,1) and (3,2) as possible overlapping cells. Let's denote variables:\n\nLet A = (2,0), B=(2,1), C=(3,2), D=(1,1), E=(1,2).\n\nFrom (3,1)=2: mines in A + B + C = 2.\n\nFrom (2,2)=2: mines in D + E + B + C = 2.\n\nIf we assume that (3,2) is a mine (C=1), then (3,1)=2 would require A + B = 1. Then (2,2)=2 would need D + E + B = 1. But without more info, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for cells that are definitely safe. Let's check row 3, column 4 is 0, which we already did. What about row 4, column 6? It's ?. Let's check adjacent cells. (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,6)=1. (3,5)=1: adjacent mines. (3,6)=2: has 2 mines. (4,5)=1: 1 mine. (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1: 1 mine each. Not sure.\n\nAnother area: row 7, column 4 is F. Let's check if that's a correct flag. The cell (7,3) is 1. (7,3) adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=0 (row 6, column 2 is 0), (6,3)=1 (row 6, column 3 is 1), (6,4)=1 (row 6, column 4 is 1), (7,2)=0 (row 7, column 2 is 0), (7,4)=F (mine), (8,2)=0 (row 8, column 2 is 0), (8,3)=2 (row 8, column 3 is 2), (8,4)=3 (row 8, column 4 is 3). So (7,3)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. (7,4)=F is that mine, so that's correct. So the flag at (7,4) is correct (since (7,3)=1 requires 1 mine, and (7,4) is the only possible mine there). So that's a correct flag.\n\nNow, the user has 1 correct flag out of 11, which suggests 10 incorrect flags. So the F at (7,4) is correct, others are wrong.\n\nLet's look for safe cells to uncover. The safest cells are those adjacent to 0s, but we checked those. Another approach: cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number of known mines equals the number, so the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 0 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). (4,0)=0 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe, since it's a number). So (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (2,0) or (2,1). So those two cells have 1 mine.\n\nRow 4, column 1 is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (5,1)=0 (safe), (5,2)=0 (safe). So (4,1)=1 has 1 mine in (3,2). So (3,2) must be a mine? Wait, (4,1)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,2), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2). All except (3,2) are safe (since they are 0 or numbers). So (3,2) must be the mine. Because (4,1)=1 requires exactly 1 mine, and all others are safe. So (3,2) is a mine!\n\nWait, let's confirm. (4,1)=1: the 8 adjacent cells. Let's list them:\n\n- (3,0): value 1 (uncovered, so not a mine)\n- (3,1): value 2 (uncovered, not a mine)\n- (3,2): ? (unknown)\n- (4,0): value 0 (uncovered, not a mine)\n- (4,2): value 1 (uncovered, not a mine)\n- (5,0): value 0 (uncovered, not a mine)\n- (5,1): value 0 (uncovered, not a mine)\n- (5,2): value 0 (uncovered, not a mine)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (3,2) are safe (not mines). Since (4,1) is 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Therefore, (3,2) must be the mine. So (3,2) is a mine. So we should flag that. But wait, the user's current flags are 11, and only 1 is correct. So maybe they have a flag there already? Let's check the current board again.\n\nCurrent board row 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\" → column 2 is ?, so no flag there. So (3,2) is a mine, so we should flag it. But wait, let's check another angle.\n\nWait, (3,1)=2: adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). If (3,2) is a mine (from (4,1)=1), then (3,1)=2 needs 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,2)=2: adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,3)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So (2,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 needs 1 more mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Which aligns with (3,1)=2 needing 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So (3,2) is a mine.\n\nBut let's check (3,2) again. If (4,1)=1, then (3,2) must be a mine. So we should flag (3,2). But the user's current flags are 11, which is more than the 10 mines. So they have 11 flags, 1 correct. So maybe some of those flags are wrong, and (3,2) is a mine that's not flagged yet. So flagging (3,2) would increase the correct flags.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe. Let's look at row 7, column 6. (7,5)=2, which has 2 mines. We know (7,4)=F is a mine, so 1 more mine in (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe). So those are numbers, not mines. So the remaining possible cells are (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (8,4)=3 (safe, it's a number). So (8,4) is not a mine. So (7,5)=2's remaining mine is in (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,6) might be a mine or not.\n\nAnother cell: row 8, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe), (9,2)=0 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So (8,3)=2 has 2 mines. We have 1 mine at (7,4), so 1 more mine in (9,4). So (9,4) must be a mine. Because all other adjacent cells are safe. Let's confirm:\n\n(8,3)=2: adjacent cells are (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe), (9,2)=0 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (9,4)=?. So only (9,4) is unknown. So (8,3)=2 needs 2 mines, one is (7,4), so the other must be (9,4). So (9,4) is a mine. So we should flag (9,4).\n\nWait, that's a solid deduction. (8,3)=2 has 8 adjacent cells. 6 of them are safe (0 or numbers), 1 is a known mine (F at (7,4)), so the 8th cell (9,4) must be the second mine. Therefore, (9,4) is a mine. So flagging (9,4) would be correct.\n\nLet's check another angle. (9,3)=1: adjacent cells are (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2)… wait, rows are 0-8 (since 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8). Wait, the current board shows 10 rows (0-9), which is a mistake. Probably, it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. The user might have made a typo in the board display, showing 10 rows. Let's assume rows 0-8. So row 9 in the display is actually row 8, but that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's 10x10, but the problem says 9x9. Let's proceed with the given data, assuming that the rows are 0-9 (maybe 10x10), but the problem states 9x9. Maybe the input has a formatting error. Let's ignore that and focus on the logic.\n\nAssuming (8,3)=2 (row 8, column 3) has adjacent cells including (9,4) (row 9, column 4). If (8,3)=2, and we have one mine at (7,4), then (9,4) must be the other mine. So (9,4) is a mine.\n\nAnother cell: row 8, column 4 is 3. Adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So (8,4)=3 has 3 mines. We have 1 mine at (7,4), so 2 more mines in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). If (9,4) is a mine (from (8,3)=2), then (8,4)=3 needs 1 more mine in (8,5) or (9,5).\n\nLet's go back to (4,1)=1. Its adjacent cells: (3,2) is the only unknown. So (3,2) must be a mine. So (3,2) is a mine.\n\nSo possible correct flags are (7,4), (3,2), (9,4). The user has 1 correct flag, so likely (7,4) is the correct one. So to increase the score, we should flag (3,2) and (9,4). But the question is, what action to take now. The options are uncover, flag, unflag.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe to uncover. Let's look for a cell that has all adjacent mines already accounted for, so the cell is safe.\n\nFor example, row 3, column 6 is 2. Let's check (3,6)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=1 (safe), (3,5)=1 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe). So (3,6)=2 has 2 mines in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7). If we can determine how many mines are there.\n\nAlternatively, row 5, column 6 is 1. (5,6)=1: adjacent cells (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5)=1 (safe), (5,5)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe). So (5,6)=1 has 1 mine in (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7).\n\nNot helpful. Let's think of the 0s again. Are there any 0s that have adjacent ? cells? For example, row 4, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0). (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe). All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 0 is 0: adjacent cells (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0). All safe.\n\nRow 6, column 0 is 0: adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0). All safe.\n\nRow 7, column 0 is 0: adjacent cells (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0). All safe.\n\nRow 8, column 0 is 0: adjacent cells (7,0), (7,1), (8,1), (9,0). All safe.\n\nSo no 0s with adjacent ? cells. So the next best is to find a cell that's adjacent to a number where the number of known mines is less than the number, but the remaining cells are all safe. Wait, maybe (3,4) is 0. Wait, (3,4) is 0, which we already checked.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's surrounded by numbers that indicate it's safe. For example, row 7, column 6 is ?. Let's check (7,6). Its adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7). (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,5)=? (unknown), (8,6)=? (unknown). So not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: since the user has 11 flags, which is more than the 10 mines, they must have some incorrect flags. So unflagging a wrong flag might help. But the problem states the score is correct flags \/ total mines, so unflagging a wrong flag doesn't decrease the score (since correct flags stay the same, but total flags decrease). But the user's current flags are 1\/11, so unflagging 10 wrong flags would leave 1\/1, which is 1.0, but that's only if the remaining flag is correct. However, the user might not know which flags are wrong.\n\nBut the question is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nGiven that we deduced (3,2) is a mine (from (4,1)=1), and (9,4) is a mine (from (8,3)=2), we should flag those. Let's check if (3,2) is currently flagged. Looking at the current board:\n\nRow 3: \"1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\" → column 2 is ?, so not flagged. So we can flag (3,2).\n\nSimilarly, row 9, column 4: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\" → column 4 is ?, so not flagged. So flag (9,4).\n\nBut which one to choose first? Let's confirm (3,2) again. (4,1)=1 has 8 adjacent cells, 7 of which are safe (0 or numbers), so the 8th (3,2) must be a mine. That's a solid deduction. So flagging (3,2) is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,2) in the context of (3,1)=2. (3,1)=2 has 8 adjacent cells. (3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So 4 safe cells. The remaining 4 cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2). (3,1)=2 needs 2 mines here. If (3,2) is a mine, then there's 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,2)=2 has 8 adjacent cells. (1,3)=1 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So 4 safe cells. The remaining 4 cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). (2,2)=2 needs 2 mines here. If (3,2) is a mine, then 1 more mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Which is possible. So (3,2) being a mine fits both (3,1)=2 and (2,2)=2.\n\nTherefore, (3,2) is a mine. So the action should be to flag (3,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,2)","flag (3,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's look at the current Minesweeper board. The goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells without hitting a mine. The score is based on correct flags, so we need to make sure we flag mines accurately.\n\nFirst, let's parse the current board. The user mentioned the board is 9x9, but the given board has 10 rows. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let's check the rows:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (10 cells, maybe row 0 is 0-9)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nAssuming rows are 0-9 and columns 0-9 (since 10 cells per row). Let's note the known cells.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells with 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 2 has a 0 at (2,4) and (2,5). Let's check their neighbors.\n\n(2,4) is 0. Adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). But (2,4) is 0, so all adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's check those cells. For example, (3,4) is 0 (from row 3: \"1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\" so (3,4) is 0). That's already uncovered. (2,5) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (2,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells have 0 mines. (3,5) is 1, which is okay because 1 is the count of adjacent mines, not that it's a mine. Wait, 0 means no adjacent mines, so the cell itself is safe, and all 8 neighbors are safe. So if a cell is 0, all 8 neighbors are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\". The 0 at (4,0). Adjacent cells would be (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (4,0) is 0, so those cells are safe. (3,0) is 1 (from row 3: \"1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\"), which is uncovered, (3,1) is 2 (uncovered), (4,1) is 1 (uncovered), (5,0) is 0 (uncovered), (5,1) is 0 (uncovered). So that's all good.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\". The 0s here are (5,0) to (5,4). Let's take (5,4) which is 0. Adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (5,4) is 0, so all those cells are safe. Let's check: (4,3) is 1 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1...\"), (4,4) is 0 (row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0...\"), (4,5) is 1 (row 4: \"...0 1...\"), (5,3) is 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0...\"), (5,5) is 1 (row 5: \"...0 1 1...\"), (6,3) is 1 (row 6: \"0 0 0 1...\"), (6,4) is 1 (row 6: \"...1 1 1...\"), (6,5) is 1 (row 6: \"...1 1 1...\"). All of these are uncovered, so no new info there.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". Let's look at (6,3) which is 1. Its adjacent cells: (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). (6,3) is 1, so there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. Let's check which are known: (5,2)=0 (row5), (5,3)=0 (row5), (5,4)=0 (row5), (6,2)=0 (row6), (6,4)=1 (row6), (7,2)=0 (row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2...\"), (7,3)=1 (row7: \"...0 1 F...\"), (7,4)=F (flagged). So (7,4) is flagged. So (6,3) has 1 mine, and (7,4) is a flag. If that flag is correct, then (6,3)'s count is satisfied (1 mine at (7,4)). So that's possible.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\". (7,4) is F (flagged). Let's check (7,5) which is 2. Adjacent cells to (7,5): (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (7,5) is 2, so 2 mines in those cells. Known cells: (6,4)=1 (row6), (6,5)=1 (row6), (6,6)=1 (row6), (7,4)=F (flag), (8,4)=3 (row8: \"0 0 0 2 3...\"), (8,5)=? (unknown). So (7,5)=2. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). The flagged cell (7,4) is a possible mine. If (7,4) is a mine, then that's 1 mine. So we need 1 more mine in the adjacent cells.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\". (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. Let's check (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (8,4)=3, so 3 mines here. Known cells: (7,3)=1 (row7), (7,4)=F (flag), (7,5)=2 (row7), (8,3)=2 (row8), (9,3)=1 (row9: \"0 0 0 1...\"), (9,4)=? (unknown), (9,5)=? (unknown). So (7,4) is a flag (possible mine). So if (7,4) is a mine, then we need 2 more mines in the adjacent cells: (7,5), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). But (7,5) is 2, which is a number, not a mine. (8,3)=2 is a number. So possible mines could be in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5), etc.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\". (9,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2) [but 9 is the last row], (10,3), (10,4). So (9,3) adjacent cells are (8,2)=0 (row8), (8,3)=2 (row8), (8,4)=3 (row8), (9,2)=0 (row9), (9,4)=? (unknown), and the rest are out of bounds. So (9,3)=1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that could be mines are (8,4) (but it's a 3, which is a number), (9,4). So (9,4) might be a mine? Or (8,4)'s adjacent cells.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover. The 0 cells' adjacent cells are all safe. Let's check row 2, column 4 is 0. Its adjacent cells include (3,4) which is 0 (already uncovered), (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,5)=0 (uncovered), (1,4)=1 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=1 (uncovered). All covered.\n\nRow 3 has (3,4)=0. Adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,4)=0 (uncovered), (2,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=1 (uncovered), (4,3)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=0 (uncovered), (4,5)=1 (uncovered). All covered.\n\nRow 4, (4,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). All of these are uncovered (3,3=1, 3,4=0, 3,5=1, 4,3=1, 4,5=1, 5,3=0, 5,4=0, 5,5=1). So no new cells here.\n\nRow 5, (5,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, (6,0)=0. Adjacent cells: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=0 (row7: \"0 0 0 1...\"), (7,1)=0 (row7), (5,-1) invalid, (6,-1) invalid, (7,-1) invalid. So all adjacent cells are safe and uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are unknown (?) and see if they can be determined as safe.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". Columns 0-2 and 7-9 are unknown. Let's take (1,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (1,3)=1, so 1 mine in those cells. Known cells: (1,4)=1 (row1), (2,3)=1 (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0...\"), (2,4)=0 (row2). So (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2) are unknown. (2,2)=2 (row2: \"? ? 2 1...\"), so (2,2)=2. Let's check (2,2)=2. Its adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2)=2, so 2 mines here. Known cells: (1,3)=1 (row1), (2,3)=1 (row2), (3,1)=2 (row3: \"1 2 F 1...\"), (3,2)=F (flagged), (3,3)=1 (row3). So (3,2) is F (flagged). So (2,2) has adjacent cells including (3,2)=F (possible mine). So (3,2) is a flag. Let's see if that's a correct mine. (2,2)=2, so if (3,2) is a mine, then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1). (3,1)=2 (uncovered, so not a mine). So (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) could have 1 mine.\n\nRow 3: \"1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". (3,2)=F (flagged). Let's check (3,1)=2. Its adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,1)=2, so 2 mines here. Known cells: (2,2)=2 (row2), (3,0)=1 (row3), (3,2)=F (flag), (4,0)=0 (row4), (4,1)=1 (row4), (4,2)=1 (row4). So (3,2) is a flag (possible mine). If (3,2) is a mine, then there's 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) (but (2,2) is 2, a number, not a mine), (3,0) (1, number), so (2,0) or (2,1). So (3,1)=2 could have (3,2) as mine and one more in (2,0)\/(2,1).\n\nNow, let's check the flags. The user has 2 flags (Flags: 2\/11), but the total mines are 10. So there are 10 mines, and they've flagged 2, but 11 flags (maybe a typo, 2\/10? Or 2 flagged, 11 total attempts? The score is 0.1818, which is 2\/11, so 2 correct out of 11 flagged. So 11 flags placed, 2 correct, 9 incorrect. So the current flags (F) on the board are 2? Let's check the board:\n\nLooking at the current board, there are two F's: (3,2) and (7,4). So row 3, column 2 is F, and row 7, column 4 is F. So those are the two flags. The score is 2\/10 (if 10 mines), but the user says 2\/11, so maybe 11 flags placed, 2 correct. So those two F's might be correct or not.\n\nLet's check (3,2)=F. Let's see if that's a mine. (3,1)=2, which has 2 adjacent mines. (3,1) adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,0)=1 (number, not mine), (4,0)=0 (number), (4,1)=1 (number), (4,2)=1 (number). (2,2)=2 (number). So possible mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,0) or (2,1) must be the other mine. Let's check (2,2)=2. (2,2) adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,3)=1 (number), (2,3)=1 (number), (3,1)=2 (number), (3,3)=1 (number). So possible mines: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2) needs 1 more mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (3,1)=2 and (2,2)=2 both could have (3,2) as a mine. So (3,2) is a possible mine.\n\nNow (7,4)=F. Let's check (7,3)=1. (7,3) adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=0 (row6), (6,3)=1 (row6), (6,4)=1 (row6), (7,2)=0 (row7), (8,2)=0 (row8), (8,3)=2 (row8), (8,4)=3 (row8). So (7,3)=1. If (7,4) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine. So (7,3)=1 is satisfied. That's a good sign. (7,5)=2. (7,5) adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1 (row6), (6,5)=1 (row6), (6,6)=1 (row6), (7,4)=F (flag), (8,4)=3 (row8). So if (7,4) is a mine, then (7,5)=2 needs 1 more mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). That's possible.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any 0 cell's adjacent cells that are still ?. Let's check row 6, column 6 is 1 (row6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\"), so (6,6)=1. Its adjacent cells: (5,5), (5,6), (5,7), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5), (7,6), (7,7). (5,5)=1 (row5), (5,6)=1 (row5), (6,5)=1 (row6), (7,5)=2 (row7). So (6,6)=1 has 1 mine in those cells. If (7,4) is a mine, maybe (7,6) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 5. (8,5) is ?. Its adjacent cell (8,4)=3. (8,4)=3, which has 3 mines in adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine, then (8,4) has (7,4) as 1 mine. Then (8,4) needs 2 more mines. Adjacent cells to (8,4) are (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. So (7,3) is 1 (number), (7,5) is 2 (number), (8,3) is 2 (number), (9,3) is 1 (number). So possible mines in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5).\n\nBut maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe. Let's check row 1, column 4=1. Its adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (1,4)=1, so 1 mine here. (1,3)=1 (row1), (1,5)=1 (row1), (2,3)=1 (row2), (2,4)=0 (row2), (2,5)=0 (row2). So (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) are unknown. Since (2,4) and (2,5) are 0, their adjacent cells (1,4) and (1,5) are safe, so (1,4) and (1,5) are numbers, not mines. So (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) could have 1 mine in total.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 5, column 5=1 (row5: \"...0 1 1...\"). Its adjacent cells: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1. (4,4)=0, so (4,5) is safe (already uncovered). (5,4)=0, so (5,5) is safe (uncovered). So (4,6) and (5,6) are adjacent to (5,5)=1. (5,5)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,4)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1 are all safe. So the mine must be in (4,6) or (5,6). But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are surrounded by numbers that indicate they must be safe. For example, in row 3, column 4=0. All adjacent cells are safe, which are already uncovered. How about row 4, column 6=? (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\"). (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. Let's check (3,6)=2. (3,6)=2's adjacent cells: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). (2,5)=0 (row2), (3,5)=1 (row3), (4,5)=1 (row4). So (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7) are unknown. (3,6)=2 needs 2 mines here. (2,5)=0, so (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5)=0? (2,5) is 0, so (2,6) is safe (since 0 means no adjacent mines, so (2,6) is not a mine). Wait, (2,5)=0's adjacent cells include (2,6). Since (2,5)=0, (2,6) has 0 mines adjacent to (2,5), but (2,6) itself could be a number. Wait, no: (2,5)=0 means that all 8 adjacent cells to (2,5) have 0 mines. So (2,6) is adjacent to (2,5), so (2,6) cannot be a mine. Because if (2,6) were a mine, then (2,5) would have at least 1 adjacent mine, but (2,5) is 0. Therefore, (2,6) is safe. That's a key point!\n\nYes! If a cell is 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe (not mines). So (2,5)=0. Its adjacent cells include (2,6). Therefore, (2,6) is not a mine. So (2,6) can be safely uncovered.\n\nLet's confirm: (2,5) is in row 2, column 5. The 8 adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\n\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nSince (2,5)=0, all of these adjacent cells have 0 mines. Therefore, (2,6) is not a mine. So (2,6) is safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at the current board, row 2 is \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". So (2,6) is 1 (already uncovered). Wait, row 2: columns 0-9 are \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". So (2,6) is 1 (uncovered). Oh right, so (2,6) is 1, which is a number, so that's already uncovered. My mistake.\n\nLet's check another 0 cell. Row 2, column 4=0. Its adjacent cells include (1,5). (1,5)=1 (row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\"), which is uncovered. (1,5) is 1, so it's safe.\n\nRow 3, column 4=0. Its adjacent cells include (4,5)=1 (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1...\"), which is uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 4=0. Its adjacent cells include (5,5)=1 (row5: \"...0 1 1...\"), which is uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4=0. Its adjacent cells include (6,5)=1 (row6: \"...1 1 1...\"), which is uncovered.\n\nHow about row 6, column 0=0. Its adjacent cells are (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 0=0 (row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2...\"). Adjacent cells are (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,0)=0 (row8: \"0 0 0 2...\"), (8,1)=0 (row8). All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 0=0 (row8: \"0 0 0 2 3...\"). Adjacent cells (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,1)=0, (9,0)=0 (row9: \"0 0 0 1...\"), (9,1)=0 (row9). All uncovered.\n\nRow 9, column 0=0 (row9: \"0 0 0 1...\"). Adjacent cells (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (9,1)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 cells' adjacent cells are already uncovered. Now, let's look for cells that are adjacent to numbers and can be determined.\n\nLet's take (7,6) which is ? (row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\"). (7,6) is adjacent to (7,5)=2. (7,5)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. We know (7,4)=F (flagged). If (7,4) is a mine, then (7,5) needs 1 more mine. The adjacent cells of (7,5) are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (6,4)=1 (row6), (6,5)=1 (row6), (6,6)=1 (row6), (7,4)=F, (8,4)=3 (row8). So (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are numbers, not mines. (8,4)=3 is a number. So possible mines are (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,6) could be a mine or not.\n\nHow about (8,5) in row8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\". (8,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3. (8,4)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells. If (7,4)=F is a mine, then (8,4) has 1 mine. So needs 2 more. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=1 (number), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (number), (8,3)=2 (number), (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1 (number), (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. So possible mines: (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). If (8,5) is a mine, then (8,4)=3 would have 2 mines (F and 8,5), needing 1 more.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (9,3)=1 (row9: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"). (9,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells: (8,2)=0 (row8), (8,3)=2 (row8), (8,4)=3 (row8), (9,2)=0 (row9), (9,4)=?, (9,3) is at (9,3), so other adjacent cells are (10,2), (10,3), (10,4) which are out of bounds. So the only possible mine is (9,4). So (9,3)=1 implies (9,4) is a mine. Because all other adjacent cells are numbers (not mines). So (9,4) must be a mine.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (9,3) is at row 9, column 3. Its 8 adjacent cells are:\n\nrow 8, column 2: (8,2)=0 (number, not mine)\n\nrow 8, column 3: (8,3)=2 (number, not mine)\n\nrow 8, column 4: (8,4)=3 (number, not mine)\n\nrow 9, column 2: (9,2)=0 (number, not mine)\n\nrow 9, column 4: (9,4)=? (unknown)\n\nrow 10, column 2: out of bounds (since rows are 0-9)\n\nrow 10, column 3: out of bounds\n\nrow 10, column 4: out of bounds\n\nSo the only adjacent cell that could be a mine is (9,4). Since (9,3)=1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Therefore, (9,4) must be a mine. So we should flag (9,4). But wait, the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag. But maybe we can uncover a safe cell.\n\nWait, but (9,4) is a mine, so if we flag it, that's a correct flag. But the user has 2 correct flags out of 11, so maybe they have 11 flags placed, 2 correct. But the current board shows only 2 F's, so perhaps the 11 flags are a mistake. Anyway, let's focus on safe cells to uncover.\n\nAnother cell: (5,7) in row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\". (5,7) is ?. Let's check its adjacent cells. (5,7) is adjacent to (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,6)=1 (row5), (5,8)=?, (6,6)=1 (row6), (6,7)=?, (6,8)=?. (5,6)=1 (row5) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (5,6) adjacent cells: (4,5)=1 (row4), (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1 (row5), (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1 (row6), (6,6)=1 (row6), (6,7)=?. (5,6)=1, so 1 mine here. Known cells: (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1 are numbers, not mines. So possible mines in (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). Not helpful.\n\nHow about (6,7) in row6: \"0 0 0 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". (6,7) is ?. Adjacent cells: (5,6)=1 (row5), (5,7)=?, (5,8)=?, (6,6)=1 (row6), (6,8)=?, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=?. (6,6)=1 (row6) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (6,6) adjacent cells: (5,5)=1 (row5), (5,6)=1 (row5), (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1 (row6), (6,7)=?, (7,5)=2 (row7), (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?. (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=1, (7,5)=2 are numbers, not mines. So (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7) could have 1 mine. Not helpful.\n\nLet's think of the win condition: uncover all safe cells. Safe cells are all non-mine cells. There are 9x9=81 cells, 10 mines, so 71 safe cells. The current board has some uncovered cells. Let's count how many are uncovered.\n\nRow 0: all ? (10 cells) → 0 uncovered.\n\nRow 1: columns 3-6 are 1s (4 cells), others ? → 4.\n\nRow 2: columns 2-6: 2,1,0,0,1 (5 cells) → 5.\n\nRow 3: columns 0-6: 1,2,F,1,0,1,2 (7 cells) → 7.\n\nRow 4: columns 0-5: 0,1,1,1,0,1 (6 cells) → 6.\n\nRow 5: columns 0-6: 0,0,0,0,0,1,1 (7 cells) →7.\n\nRow 6: columns 0-6: 0,0,0,1,1,1,1 (7 cells) →7.\n\nRow 7: columns 0-5: 0,0,0,1,F,2 (6 cells) →6.\n\nRow 8: columns 0-4: 0,0,0,2,3 (5 cells) →5.\n\nRow 9: columns 0-3: 0,0,0,1 (4 cells) →4.\n\nTotal uncovered cells: 0+4+5+7+6+7+7+6+5+4=51. So 51 uncovered, 71 safe cells needed. So 71-51=20 safe cells left to uncover.\n\nTo win, we need to uncover all safe cells. So we need to find safe cells (non-mine) that are still ?.\n\nLet's find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look at (1,4)=1 in row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". (1,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0 are all uncovered. (2,4)=0 and (2,5)=0 mean their adjacent cells (1,4) and (1,5) are safe (which they are, as numbers). The cells (0,3), (0,4), (0,5) are adjacent to (1,4)=1. Since (1,4)=1, there's 1 mine among these three. But we can't determine which.\n\nHow about (3,7) in row3: \"1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". (3,7) is ?. Adjacent cells: (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), (3,6), (3,8), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8). (2,6)=1 (row2), (3,6)=2 (row3), (4,6)=? (row4). (3,6)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. (3,6) adjacent cells: (2,5)=0 (row2), (2,6)=1 (row2), (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1 (row3), (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1 (row4), (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?. (2,5)=0, so (2,6) is safe (already 1). (3,5)=1 and (4,5)=1 are safe. So (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7) could have 2 mines. Not helpful.\n\nLet's look at (4,6) in row4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\". (4,6) is ?. Adjacent cells: (3,5)=1 (row3), (3,6)=2 (row3), (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1 (row4), (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1 (row5), (5,6)=1 (row5), (5,7)=?. (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1 are numbers. So (3,7), (4,7), (5,7) could be mines. (3,6)=2 needs 2 mines in adjacent cells, which include (3,7) and (4,6), (4,7). Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the game ends at 100th epoch, so we have time. We need to uncover a safe cell. Let's pick a cell that is likely safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, all cells are ?. But row 1 has (1,3)=1. (1,3) adjacent to (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,3)=1 (row2), (2,4)=0 (row2), (2,2)=2 (row2). (2,2)=2 has adjacent cells including (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)=F, (3,3). (3,2)=F is a flag. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 has 1 mine there, so another mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (1,2) could be a mine. Then (1,3)=1 has 1 mine in (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2). If (1,2) is a mine, then (1,3)=1 is satisfied. So (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are safe. So (0,3) could be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (5,7) in row5: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 ? ? ?\". (5,7) is ?. Its adjacent cell (5,6)=1 (row5). (5,6)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (5,6) adjacent cells: (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=?, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?. (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1 are numbers, not mines. So 1 mine in (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). So (5,7) has a 25% chance of being a mine, which is low. Maybe safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (7,6) in row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\". (7,6) is ?. Adjacent to (7,5)=2. (7,5)=2 has 2 mines. If (7,4)=F is a mine, then 1 more mine needed. (7,5) adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?. (6,4), (6,5), (6,6) are numbers, (8,4)=3 is a number. So possible mines: (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). So (7,6) has a 1\/3 chance of being a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has only one possible mine. For example, (9,4) we thought might be a mine, but (9,3)=1. If (9,4) is a mine, then (9,3)=1 is satisfied. So (9,4) is a mine. But if we uncover (9,4), we hit a mine and lose. So we shouldn't uncover that.\n\nHow about (8,5) in row8: \"0 0 0 2 3 ? ? ? ? ?\". (8,5) is ?. Adjacent to (8,4)=3. (8,4)=3 has 3 mines. If (7,4)=F is a mine, then 2 more needed. (8,4) adjacent cells: (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. (7,3)=1, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (9,3)=1 are numbers. So (8,5), (9,4), (9,5) could have 2 mines. So (8,5) has a 2\/3 chance of being a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (1,0) in row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". (1,0) is ?. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,2)=2 (row2). (2,2) has 2 mines in adjacent cells, which include (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1)=2, (3,2)=F. (3,2)=F is a flag. So (2,2)=2 has 1 mine at (3,2) if it's correct, and 1 more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (1,0) is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,1). (2,0) is ?, (2,1) is ?. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: look for cells that are adjacent to multiple 1s. For example, (0,4) in row0: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\". (0,4) is adjacent to (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1. (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1 each have 1 mine in their adjacent cells. (1,3) adjacent cells include (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (1,4) adjacent cells include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (1,5) adjacent cells include (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, so (1,4) and (1,5) have adjacent cells (2,4) and (2,5) which are 0, meaning no mines there. So (1,3)=1 has 1 mine in (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2). (1,4)=1 has 1 mine in (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,2), (1,6), (2,2), (2,6). (1,5)=1 has 1 mine in (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6). If (0,4) is a mine, then (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) would each have that mine, but they each need only 1 mine. So (0,4) being a mine would satisfy all three, but that's impossible because (1,3), (1,4), (1,5) each need 1 mine, but (0,4) is a single mine. So (0,4) is not a mine. Therefore, (0,4) is safe.\n\nYes! Let's think: (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1.\n\nIf (0,4) were a mine, then:\n\n- (1,3)=1: adjacent to (0,4) (mine), so that's 1 mine. Good.\n\n- (1,4)=1: adjacent to (0,4) (mine), so that's 1 mine. Good.\n\n- (1,5)=1: adjacent to (0,4) (mine), so that's 1 mine. Good.\n\nBut that would mean (0,4) is a mine, and all three 1s are satisfied by that single mine. Is that possible? Yes, because a single mine can be adjacent to multiple cells. For example, a mine at (0,4) is adjacent to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), so each of those cells would count that mine. So (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1 could all have their mine count satisfied by (0,4) being a mine. But that's possible. So (0,4) could be a mine.\n\nAlternatively, if (0,4) is not a mine, then each of the 1s must have their mine in other cells. For (1,3)=1, the mine could be in (0,2), (0,3), (1,2), (2,2). For (1,4)=1, the mine could be in (0,3), (0,5), (1,2), (1,6), (2,2), (2,6). For (1,5)=1, the mine could be in (0,5), (0,6), (1,6), (2,6). So it's possible that (0,4) is safe.\n\nBut we need to find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's go back to the 0 cells. For example, (3,4)=0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, and they are all uncovered. How about (4,4)=0. Same thing.\n\nAnother approach: look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has only one unknown cell. For example, (2,1) in row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". (2,1) is ?. Adjacent to (2,2)=2. (2,2)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,3)=1 (row1), (2,3)=1 (row2), (3,1)=2 (row3), (3,2)=F (row3), (3,3)=1 (row3). So (3,2)=F is a flag. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 needs 1 more mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (2,1) could be a mine or not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (7,7) in row7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? ? ?\". (7,7) is ?. Adjacent to (7,6)=?, (7,8)=?, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=?, (6,8)=?, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?, (8,8)=?. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best bet is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is unknown. Wait, all 0 adjacent cells are already uncovered. So next, look for cells adjacent to 1s that have multiple 1s indicating safety.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 0, column 4. If we uncover (0,4), if it's a mine, we lose. If it's safe, we uncover it. But how likely is it a mine?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (5,7). Since row5 has many 0s, maybe (5,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (4,6). Row4, column 6 is ?. Adjacent to (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. (3,5)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which are (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (4,5)=1. (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,4)=0 are all safe, so (3,5)=1's mine must be in (2,6)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,6)=?, (4,5)=1. But (2,6)=1 and (3,6)=2 are numbers, not mines. (4,5)=1 is a number. So the mine must be in (4,6). So (4,6) is a mine. Oh! That's a key point.\n\nLet's recheck (3,5)=1. (3,5) is in row3, column5. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,4), (2,5), (2,6),\n\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6),\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6).\n\n(3,5)=1 means there is 1 mine in these 8 cells.\n\nNow, let's list the known status of these cells:\n\n(2,4)=0 (row2: \"? ? 2 1 0...\") → safe (not a mine)\n\n(2,5)=0 (row2: \"...0 0 1...\") → safe\n\n(2,6)=1 (row2: \"...0 1 ?...\") → number (not a mine)\n\n(3,4)=0 (row3: \"...1 0 1...\") → safe\n\n(3,5)=1 → current cell (not a mine)\n\n(3,6)=2 (row3: \"...0 1 2...\") → number (not a mine)\n\n(4,4)=0 (row4: \"0 1 1 1 0...\") → safe\n\n(4,5)=1 (row4: \"...0 1 ?...\") → number (not a mine)\n\n(4,6)=? → unknown\n\nSo all adjacent cells to (3,5) are either safe (not mines) or numbers (not mines) except (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) must be the mine that makes (3,5)=1 correct. Therefore, (4,6) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, let's check (3,6)=2. (3,6) is in row3, column6. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n\n(3,5), (3,6), (3,7),\n\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n\n(3,6)=2 means 2 mines in these cells.\n\nKnown cells:\n\n(2,5)=0 → safe\n\n(2,6)=1 → number\n\n(3,5)=1 → number\n\n(4,5)=1 → number\n\n(4,6)=mine (from previous deduction)\n\nSo (2,7), (3,7), (4,7) are unknown. So (3,6)=2 has 1 mine at (4,6), so needs 1 more mine in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7).\n\nNow, let's check (4,5)=1. (4,5) is in row4, column5. Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6),\n\n(4,4), (4,5), (4,6),\n\n(5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n\n(4,5)=1 means 1 mine in these cells.\n\nKnown cells:\n\n(3,4)=0 → safe\n\n(3,5)=1 → number\n\n(3,6)=2 → number\n\n(4,4)=0 → safe\n\n(4,6)=mine → mine\n\n(5,4)=0 → safe\n\n(5,5)=1 → number\n\n(5,6)=1 → number\n\nSo (4,5)=1 has 1 mine at (4,6), which satisfies the count. Good.\n\nNow, let's find a safe cell. Let's look at (2,7) in row2: \"? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\". (2,7) is ?. Adjacent to (3,6)=2. (3,6)=2 has 2 mines, one at (4,6), so one more in (2,7), (3,7), (4,7). So (2,7) could be a mine or not.\n\nHow about (1,6) in row1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\". (1,6)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,5), (0,6), (0,7),\n\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7),\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\n(1,6)=1 means 1 mine in these cells.\n\nKnown cells:\n\n(1,5)=1 → number\n\n(2,5)=0 → safe\n\n(2,6)=1 → number\n\nSo (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,7), (2,7) are unknown. (2,5)=0 means (2,6) is safe (already 1). So (1,6)=1 has 1 mine in those unknown cells.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is unknown, but all 0 adjacent cells are uncovered. So next, look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has the least chance of being a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 9, column 5. (9,5) is ?. Adjacent to (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=?. (9,3)=1 has 1 mine at (9,4). (8,4)=3 has 3 mines, one at (7,4)=F, one at (9,4), so one more at (8,5) or (8,6) or (9,5). So (9,5) has a low chance.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick (0,4). If we uncover (0,4) and it's safe, we can get information. Let's assume (0,4) is safe.\n\nBut wait, let's think of another angle. The current score is 2\/11, which is 2 correct flags. The total mines are 10, so there are 8 mines left to flag. The user has 2 flags, so maybe the two F's are correct. Let's assume (3,2) and (7,4) are correct mines.\n\nIf (3,2) is a mine, then (3,1)=2's adjacent mines are (3,2) and one more. (3,1)=2's adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,2)=mine, so one more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,2)=2's adjacent mines are (3,2)=mine and one more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (2,1) could be a mine.\n\nIf (7,4) is a mine, then (7,3)=1 is satisfied. (7,5)=2's adjacent mines are (7,4)=mine and one more in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). (6,6)=1's adjacent mines are one in (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7). So (7,6) could be a mine.\n\nBut we need to uncover a safe cell. Let's pick (0,4). Let's say we uncover (0,4). If it's a mine, we lose. If it's safe, we see a number.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (5,7) again. Row5, column7 is ?. Adjacent to (5,6)=1. (5,6)=1's adjacent mines are one in (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7). We know (4,6) is a mine (from earlier deduction), so (5,6)=1's mine is (4,6), so (5,7) is safe. Oh! That's a key point.\n\nYes! (5,6)=1 is in row5, column6. Its adjacent cells include (4,6), which we deduced is a mine. So (5,6)=1 has exactly 1 mine at (4,6). Therefore, the other adjacent cells to (5,6) (which are (4,7), (5,7), (6,7)) are safe. So (5,7) is safe.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n(5,6) adjacent cells:\n\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7),\n\n(5,5), (5,6), (5,7),\n\n(6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\n(5,6)=1 means 1 mine in these cells.\n\nKnown cells:\n\n(4,5)=1 → number\n\n(4,6)=mine → mine\n\n(5,5)=1 → number\n\n(6,5)=1 → number\n\n(6,6)=1 → number\n\nSo the only mine is (4,6). Therefore, (4,7), (5,7), (6,7) are safe. So (5,7) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nThat's a solid deduction. So the action should be to uncover (5,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,7)","uncover (5,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. Let's start by looking at the given board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but wait, the first line has 10 '?', which might be a typo. Probably each row should have 9 cells. Let me check again. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (maybe a typo, should be 9)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (9)\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? (9)\nRow 3: 1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? (9)\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 1 1 (maybe 9, perhaps a typo in the last 1)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (maybe 9)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 (maybe 9)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? 1 0 (9)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? 2 1 1 0 (9)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0 (maybe 9)\n\nHmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the number of cells per row, but I'll proceed assuming each row is 9 cells. Let's focus on the cells that are uncovered and see if we can find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nFirst, let's note the flags. The current Flags are 2\/11, meaning there are 11 flags placed, but only 2 are correct. Wait, the problem statement says \"Flags: 2\/11\"—so 11 flags have been placed, 2 correct, 9 incorrect. The total mines are 10, so the user has over-flagged.\n\nLooking at the board, there are F's in row 3, column 2 (F at (3,2)) and row 7, column 4 (F at (7,4)). Let's check if these are likely correct.\n\nLet's start with row 3: \"1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\". The cell (3,2) is F. Let's check the adjacent cells. The cell to the left is (3,1) which is 2. The 2 at (3,1) has adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells for (3,1) (row 3, column 1):\n\nAdjacent cells are:\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n(3,0), (3,2) [F],\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\nThe value at (3,1) is 2, meaning there are 2 mines in those 8 cells. Let's see what's known: (3,0) is 1 (uncovered, so safe), (4,0) is 0 (safe), (4,1) is 1 (safe), (4,2) is 1 (safe). (2,0) is ?, (2,1) is ?, (2,2) is 2 (uncovered, safe). So the 2 at (3,1) must have 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2) [F]. If (3,2) is a mine, then the other mine would be either (2,0) or (2,1). But let's check another cell. The cell (2,2) is 2. Let's look at (2,2) (row 2, column 2) which is 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n(2,1), (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,2) [F], (3,3).\n\n(2,3) is 1 (safe), (3,1) is 2 (safe), (3,3) is 1 (safe). (1,3) is 1 (safe). So the 2 at (2,2) must have 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2) [F]. If (3,2) is a mine, then there's 1 mine left among (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Let's check (3,3) which is 1. (3,3) has adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (3,2)=F, (3,4)=0, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0. The 1 at (3,3) means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown: (2,2) is 2 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (3,2)=F (maybe mine), (3,4)=0 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe). So the only possible mine here is (3,2) if it's a mine, which would satisfy the 1 at (3,3). So (3,2) being a mine seems possible. But the user has 11 flags, 2 correct, so this F might be incorrect. Maybe (3,2) is not a mine.\n\nNow row 7: \"0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? 1 0\" (assuming row 7 is (7,0) to (7,8)). The F is at (7,4). Let's check the cell (7,5) which is 2. (7,5) has adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4)=F, (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). The 2 at (7,5) means 2 mines in those 8 cells. (6,4) is 1 (safe), (6,5) is 1 (safe), (6,6) is 1 (safe), (7,4)=F (maybe mine), (7,6)=? (unknown), (8,4)=3 (safe), (8,5)=? (unknown), (8,6)=2 (safe). So if (7,4) is a mine, then there's 1 more mine in (7,6) or (8,5). Let's check (8,4) which is 3. (8,4) adjacent cells: (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=?. The 3 at (8,4) means 3 mines in those 8 cells. (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe). So mines could be (7,4)=F, (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). But 3 mines needed. If (7,4) is a mine, then 2 more mines in (8,5), (9,4), (9,5). Let's check (7,5)=2 again. If (7,4) is a mine, then (7,6) or (8,5) must be 1 mine. If (8,5) is a mine, that contributes to (8,4)'s 3. So possible. But since the user has 11 flags, which is more than the 10 mines, some flags are wrong. So maybe (7,4) is not a mine, and one of those F's is incorrect.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. A safe cell is one that is '?' and has no mine, which can be determined by the numbers around it.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 1 1\" (assuming (4,0) to (4,8)). The cell (4,6) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. The cell (3,5) is 1. (3,5) adjacent cells: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?. The 1 at (3,5) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,4)=0, (4,4)=0. So the possible mines are (2,6)=1 (but (2,6) is 1, which is a number, so safe), (3,6)=2 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (4,6)=? (unknown). Wait, (2,6) is 1, which is a number, so it's already uncovered. So (3,5)'s 1 must be from (4,6) if that's a mine, but (3,5) is 1, so if (4,6) is a mine, that's 1. But (4,5) is 1, which is adjacent to (4,6). (4,5) is 1, adjacent cells: (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. The 1 at (4,5) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. Known safe: (3,4)=0, (4,4)=0, (5,4)=0. So possible mines: (3,5)=1 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe), (4,6)=?, (5,5)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe). So (4,5)'s 1 could be from (4,6). If (4,6) is a mine, that would satisfy both (3,5) and (4,5). But maybe not. Let's check another cell.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5 is 0. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,5) (row 2, column 5):\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6),\n(2,4), (2,6),\n(3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\n(2,5) is 0, so all these 8 cells are safe. Let's check which of these are '?'. (1,4) is ?, (1,5) is ?, (1,6) is ?, (2,4) is 0 (safe), (2,6) is 1 (safe), (3,4) is 0 (safe), (3,5) is 1 (safe), (3,6) is 2 (safe). So (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are all adjacent to a 0, which means they are safe. Therefore, these cells can be uncovered safely!\n\nSo (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) are safe because they are adjacent to (2,5)=0. Let's confirm: (2,5)=0 implies all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines, so they are safe. Therefore, uncovering (1,4), (1,5), or (1,6) is safe.\n\nLet's check the coordinates. The top-left is (0,0). So row 1, column 4 is (1,4), row 1, column 5 is (1,5), row 1, column 6 is (1,6). These cells are currently '?', and since they are adjacent to a 0, they must be safe. So the best action is to uncover one of these. Let's pick (1,5) as an example, but any of them is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the given current board has 10 columns in the first row? Wait, maybe that's a typo. Let me check the input again. Oh, the user probably made a mistake in formatting the board rows. Let's assume each row should be 9 cells. Let's list out the rows properly, maybe the first row is a typo with an extra '?'. Let's correct that:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (9 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (Wait, that's 9 cells? Let's count: positions 0-8. So row 1: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?] maybe? Or maybe the user input has some formatting errors. Let's proceed carefully.\n\nThe current board as given:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (maybe 9 cells, so maybe the last ? is a mistake)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (9 cells: columns 0-8)\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? (columns 0-8)\nRow 3: 1 2 F 1 0 1 2 ? ? ? (columns 0-8)\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 1 1 (maybe 9 cells: 0-8, so the last 1 is extra)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? 1 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? 2 1 1 0 (columns 0-8)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0 (columns 0-8)\n\nWait, no, Minesweeper is 9x9, so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. So the user probably made a mistake in the number of columns per row. Let's correct each row to 9 cells:\n\nRow 0: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (9 cells)\nRow 1: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?] (columns 0-8)\nRow 2: [?, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] (columns 0-8)\nRow 3: [1, 2, F, 1, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?] (columns 0-8)\nRow 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] (columns 0-8)\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 1, F, 2, ?, ?, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, ?, 2, 1, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0] (columns 0-8) → Wait, 9x9, so rows 0-8, so row 8 is the last. So maybe the user's input has a row count error. Let's assume the correct rows are 0-8 (9 rows), each with 9 columns. Let's adjust:\n\nRow 0: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (0,0 to 0,8)\nRow 1: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?] (1,0 to 1,8)\nRow 2: [?, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] (2,0 to 2,8)\nRow 3: [1, 2, F, 1, 0, 1, 2, ?, ?] (3,0 to 3,8)\nRow 4: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?, 1, 1] (4,0 to 4,8)\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0] (5,0 to 5,8)\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (6,0 to 6,8)\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 1, F, 2, ?, ?, 1] (7,0 to 7,8)\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, ?, 2, 1, 1] (8,0 to 8,8)\n\nNow, let's look at the current state. The flags are at (3,2) and (7,4) since the user mentioned \"Flags: 2\/11\". Wait, the score is 0.1818 which is 2\/11, so 2 correct flags out of 11 flagged? But the total mines are 10, so 11 flags is over. So some flags are incorrect.\n\nOur goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe (0 adjacent mines) or definitely mines.\n\nStarting with the 0 cells, which when uncovered, reveal all adjacent cells. For example, row 4, column 4 is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. The 0 at (4,4) (row 4, column 4) means all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's see which of those are still unknown. (4,4) is 0, so adjacent cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). Let's check those:\n\n(3,3): 1 (already uncovered)\n(3,4): 0 (uncovered)\n(3,5): 1 (uncovered)\n(4,3): 1 (uncovered)\n(4,5): 1 (uncovered)\n(5,3): 0 (uncovered)\n(5,4): 0 (uncovered)\n(5,5): 1 (uncovered). So all adjacent to (4,4) are already uncovered, so no help there.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells are (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,0) is 0, (4,1) is 1, (5,1) is 0, (6,0) is 0, (6,1) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). All 0s or 0s, already uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 0. Adjacent cells (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 1, (5,3) is 0, (5,5) is 1, (6,3) is 1, (6,4) is 1, (6,5) is 1. All uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4: 0. Adjacent cells (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3) is 1, (2,4) is 0, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,5) is 1, (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 0, (4,5) is 1. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at numbered cells and their adjacent unknown cells. For example, row 3, column 1 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,1) is 2. The adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Let's list their states:\n\n(2,0): ?\n(2,1): ?\n(2,2): 2 (uncovered)\n(3,0): 1 (uncovered)\n(3,2): F (flagged)\n(4,0): 0 (uncovered)\n(4,1): 1 (uncovered)\n(4,2): 1 (uncovered)\n\nSo (3,1)=2. The number 2 means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown or flagged are (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). (3,2) is flagged (F), so if that's a correct mine, then there should be 1 more mine in (2,0) or (2,1). But since total mines are 10, and there are 11 flags (Flags: 2\/11), one of the flags is wrong. The flag at (3,2) might be incorrect. Let's check another cell.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is F (flagged). Let's check (7,5)=2. (7,5) is 2. Adjacent cells to (7,5) are (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). Their states:\n\n(6,4): 1 (uncovered)\n(6,5): 1 (uncovered)\n(6,6): 1 (uncovered)\n(7,4): F (flagged)\n(7,6): ? (unknown)\n(8,4): 3 (uncovered)\n(8,5): ? (unknown)\n(8,6): 2 (uncovered)\n\nSo (7,5)=2. The adjacent cells with possible mines: (7,4) [F], (7,6), (8,5). The 2 means there are 2 mines here. If (7,4) is a correct mine, then (7,6) or (8,5) has 1 mine. If (7,4) is not a mine, then 2 mines in (7,6) and (8,5).\n\nLooking at row 8, column 3: 2. Adjacent cells (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4) but since it's 9x9, row 8 is last, so (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,3) is 2. So (8,3)=2: adjacent cells (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2) is out of bounds. So the adjacent cells with possible mines are (7,4) [F]. Since (7,3)=1, which is adjacent to (7,4). (7,3)=1: adjacent cells (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3. So (7,3)=1 has one mine in adjacent cells. If (7,4) is a mine, that's the one. So (7,4) is likely a correct mine.\n\nBack to row 3, column 1=2. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,2)=F. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,0) and (2,1) have 1 mine. If (3,2) is not a mine, then (2,0) and (2,1) have 2 mines. Let's check row 2, column 2=2. (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Their states:\n\n(1,1): ?\n(1,2): ?\n(1,3): 1 (uncovered)\n(2,1): ?\n(2,3): 1 (uncovered)\n(3,1): 2 (uncovered)\n(3,2): F (flagged)\n(3,3): 1 (uncovered)\n\nSo (2,2)=2. The adjacent unknowns are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The 2 means 2 mines here. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2) has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). If (3,2) is not a mine, then (2,2) still has 2 mines in those three.\n\nLet's look for 0 cells that have adjacent unknowns. For example, row 4, column 6 is ?, adjacent to (4,6). Let's check the cell (4,6). The cell above it is (3,6)=2. (3,6)=2: adjacent cells (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,7), (4,6). Their states:\n\n(2,5): 0 (uncovered)\n(2,6): 1 (uncovered)\n(2,7): ? (unknown)\n(3,5): 1 (uncovered)\n(3,7): ? (unknown)\n(4,5): 1 (uncovered)\n(4,7): 1 (uncovered)\n(4,6): ? (unknown)\n\nSo (3,6)=2. The adjacent unknowns are (2,7), (3,7), (4,6). The 2 means 2 mines in these three. If we can find a cell that must be safe, that's a good move.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 6=1. (5,6)=1: adjacent cells (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). Their states:\n\n(4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1. So (5,6)=1 has adjacent unknown cell (4,6). So the 1 here means there is 1 mine in adjacent cells, which could be (4,6). But (3,6)=2, which has 2 mines in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6). If (4,6) is a mine, then (2,7) and (3,7) have 1 mine. If (4,6) is not a mine, then (2,7) and (3,7) have 2 mines.\n\nAnother area: row 8, column 4=3. (8,4)=3. Adjacent cells (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). Since it's 9x9, row 8 is last, so (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3) is out of bounds. So (8,4)=3: adjacent cells (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?. The 3 means 3 mines in adjacent cells. (7,3)=1: adjacent mines count is 1, which could be (7,4)=F. (7,5)=2: adjacent mines count is 2, which could include (7,4)=F and another. So (7,4)=F is likely a mine (correct flag). Then (8,4)=3: if (7,4) is a mine, then we need 2 more mines in (7,5), (8,3), (8,5). But (7,5)=2, which already has (7,4) as a mine, so (7,5) needs 1 more mine in its adjacent cells. (7,5) adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2. So (7,5)=2: 2 mines. If (7,4) is a mine, then 1 more mine in (7,6) or (8,5). So (8,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3. If (8,5) is a mine, that contributes to (8,4)'s 3. Let's say (7,4)=1 mine, (7,6)=1, (8,5)=1: total 3 for (8,4)=3. That works.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, row 0 has all '?'. But maybe we can find a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 2, column 4=0. (2,4)=0. Adjacent cells (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). All of these are uncovered (1,3=1; 1,4=1; 1,5=1; 2,3=1; 2,5=0; 3,3=1; 3,4=0; 3,5=1). So no unknowns there.\n\nRow 2, column 5=0. (2,5)=0. Adjacent cells (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6). (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=? (unknown), (2,4)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2. So (2,5)=0 has adjacent cell (1,6)=? which is unknown. Since (2,5)=0, (1,6) must be safe (no mine). Because 0 means all adjacent cells have 0 mines. So (1,6) is safe! That's a good candidate to uncover.\n\nLet me confirm: (2,5) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. (1,6) is adjacent to (2,5), so (1,6) cannot be a mine. Therefore, uncovering (1,6) is safe.\n\nYes, that's a solid move. (1,6) is in row 1, column 6. Let's check the current board for row 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\" which we corrected to [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, ?, ?]. So column 6 in row 1 is the 7th position (index 6). So (1,6) is that cell. Since (2,5) is 0, (1,6) must be safe. Uncovering it will reveal either 0 or a number, but no mine. That's a safe move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided the current state, so let's parse that.\n\nThe board is 9x9, but the way it's displayed here, each row is written as a line. Let me list out the rows properly. Let's index rows from 0 to 8 (since it's 9 rows) and columns 0 to 8.\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, maybe the user made a typo? 9 cells, but here it's 10 question marks. Maybe it's a formatting error. Let's assume each row has 9 cells. Let's check row 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\" that's 10, but probably 9. Maybe the user separated with spaces, so each \"?\" is a cell. Let's count:\n\nRow 0: 9 cells (probably 0-8 columns)\nRow 1: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\" → 9 cells? Let's see: 0:?, 1:?, 2:?, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:?, 8:? → that's 9. Maybe the trailing space is a mistake. Let's proceed.\n\nLooking at the board, let's list each cell with (row, col) and their current state.\n\nRow 0: all ? (0,0) to (0,8) are ?\nRow 1: (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?\nRow 2: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?\nRow 3: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2)=F, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?\nRow 4: (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1\nRow 5: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0\nRow 6: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=0\nRow 7: (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=1\nRow 8: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=0\nRow 9: Wait, no, the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8. The user might have written row 0 to 8, each with 9 cells. Let's confirm row 8: \"0 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0\" → probably 9 cells: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=?, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=1, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Maybe the user added an extra space by mistake.\n\nNow, the goal is to find a cell to uncover that's safe. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to numbers and see if we can deduce safe cells.\n\nLet's start with known 0 cells. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover those. For example, in row 3, column 4 is 0 (3,4). Let's check its adjacent cells. The 0 at (3,4) has adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). Let's check which of these are still ?.\n\n(2,3) is 1 (already uncovered), (2,4) is 0 (uncovered), (2,5) is 0 (uncovered), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (3,5) is 1 (uncovered), (4,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,4) is 0 (uncovered), (4,5) is 1 (uncovered). So the 0 at (3,4) doesn't have any adjacent ? cells left.\n\nAnother 0 is (4,0): 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0)=1 (uncovered), (3,1)=2 (uncovered), (4,1)=1 (uncovered), (5,0)=0 (uncovered), (5,1)=0 (uncovered). No ? here.\n\nRow 5, (5,4) is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,5)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, (6,0)=0: adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1). All 0s or 0-adjacent, already uncovered.\n\nRow 7, (7,0)=0: adjacent cells (6,0), (6,1), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1). All 0s, uncovered.\n\nRow 8, (8,0)=0: same as above.\n\nNow, let's look for numbers that have adjacent ? cells. For example, row 3, column 6 is 2 (3,6). Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,6) is 2, so there are 2 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are: (2,5), (2,6), (2,7), (3,5), (3,7), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). Let's list their current state:\n\n(2,5)=0 (uncovered), (2,6)=1 (uncovered), (2,7)=? (unknown), (3,5)=1 (uncovered), (3,7)=? (unknown), (4,5)=1 (uncovered), (4,6)=? (unknown), (4,7)=1 (uncovered). So the 2 at (3,6) has 3 adjacent ? cells: (2,7), (3,7), (4,6). The 2 means there are 2 mines among these three.\n\nAnother number: row 2, column 2 is 2 (2,2). Adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2)=F (flagged), (3,3)=1. So the 2 at (2,2) has adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) as ?. The 2 indicates there are 2 mines here. Since (3,2) is flagged (F), which might be a mine. If (3,2) is a correct flag, then the 2 at (2,2) would have 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). But the 2 at (2,2) is adjacent to (3,2)=F, so if F is a mine, then the remaining 1 mine is among (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). But (2,2) is 2, so 2 mines in total. So if (3,2) is a mine, then 1 more mine in those three cells.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is 2 (3,1). Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=F, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1)=2 has adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1) as ?. The 2 here: adjacent mines. (3,2) is F (mine candidate), (2,2) is 2 (already counted). So (3,1)=2: how many mines? Let's see: (3,2)=F (maybe mine) and (2,2)=2 (which is a number, not a mine). The adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,2)=F (mine), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So the 2 at (3,1) must have 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The F at (3,2) is a mine, so that's 1. Then another mine must be in (2,0) or (2,1). So (2,0) and (2,1) have 1 mine between them.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 2 (7,5). Adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2. (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine candidate), (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2 (safe). So (7,5)=2 has adjacent cells (7,6) and (8,5) as ?. The 2 here: if (7,4) is a mine (F), then 1 mine, so another mine in (7,6) or (8,5). So 1 mine in those two.\n\nRow 8, column 3 is 2 (8,3). Adjacent cells: (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0 (assuming row 8 is last, maybe (9,2) is a typo, row 8's (8,3) adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (8,3's row is 8, so (8,3) adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2) which doesn't exist. Wait, 9x9 grid, rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So (8,3) adjacent cells are: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (8,3's left is (8,2), right is (8,4), top rows 7, bottom row 8 (since 8 is the last row). So (8,3) adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (8,3-1=2, 8,3+1=4), and (8+1,3) is invalid. So 6 cells. (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe). So (8,3)=2: adjacent mines. The F at (7,4) is a mine, so 1 mine. Then another mine must be in (8,4) or (8,3) adjacent? Wait (8,4) is 3, which is a number, not a mine. So (8,3)=2: the adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4)=F, (8,2), (8,4), (8,3's other adjacent cells: (7,2) is (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, and (8,3) is in row 8, so no row 9. So the 2 at (8,3) has 1 mine (F at (7,4)), so maybe another mine in (7,4) is correct, but 2 mines needed. Maybe (7,4) is not a mine, but that's a flag. The user's current flags are 2\/11, which means 2 flags placed, 11 total (but total mines are 10, so maybe 2 flags, 11 flags attempted? The score is 0.1818 which is 2\/11, so 2 correct flags out of 11 flagged. So some flags are incorrect. So (3,2)=F and (7,4)=F are two flags, but maybe one or both are wrong.\n\nLet's check (3,2)=F. Let's look at (3,1)=2. (3,1) is 2, adjacent to (3,2)=F. If (3,2) is a mine, then (3,1) has 1 mine from (3,2), and needs 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1). Let's check (2,2)=2. (2,2) is 2, adjacent to (3,2)=F. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2) has 1 mine from (3,2), and needs 1 more mine in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (2,1) is adjacent to both (3,1) and (2,2). If (2,1) is a mine, then (3,1) would have 1 mine (3,2) and 1 mine (2,1), totaling 2, which matches (3,1)=2. Then (2,2)=2 would have (3,2)=F (mine) and (2,1)=mine, totaling 2, which matches. So that works. So (2,1) could be a mine, and (3,2)=F is correct. Then (1,1), (1,2), (2,0) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,2) is not a mine, then (3,1)=2 would need 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But (2,2)=2 is a number (safe), (3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,1)=2 would need 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1). Then (2,2)=2's adjacent cells would need 2 mines. (2,2) adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)=1 (safe), (2,1), (2,3)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (3,2)=F (maybe safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So (2,2)=2 would need 2 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). If (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (for (3,1)=2), then (2,1) is a mine, so (2,2)=2 would have 1 mine (2,1) and needs 1 more in (1,1) or (1,2). That could work too, but (3,2)=F would be incorrect.\n\nBut the user's score is 2\/11, which is 2 correct flags out of 11. So 11 flags were placed, 2 correct. So (3,2) and (7,4) are two of those 11 flags, but maybe only 2 are correct. So maybe some flags are wrong. But we need to find a safe cell to uncover.\n\nLet's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 4, column 6 is ? (4,6). Let's check its adjacent cells. (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. The (3,6)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (3,6) are (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1. So (3,6)=2 has 3 ? cells: (2,7), (3,7), (4,6). So 2 mines among these three. If (4,6) is safe, then the 2 mines are in (2,7) and (3,7). If (4,6) is a mine, then the other mine is in (2,7) or (3,7). But we don't know yet.\n\nAnother cell: row 2, column 7 is ? (2,7). Adjacent cells: (1,6)=1, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, (2,6)=1, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?. (1,6)=1: adjacent mines. (1,6) is 1, adjacent cells: (0,5)=?, (0,6)=?, (0,7)=?, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=?, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?. So (1,6)=1 has 4 ? cells. Not helpful.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is ? (7,6). Adjacent cells: (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=2, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2, (8,7)=1. (7,5)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells: (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,5)=?, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=2. So (7,5)=2: adjacent mines. If (7,4)=F is a mine (correct flag), then (7,5)=2 has 1 mine, so 1 more in (7,6) or (8,5). So (7,6) and (8,5) have 1 mine between them. So if we uncover one, if it's safe, the other is a mine. But we need to find a safe cell.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 3 (8,4). Adjacent cells: (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2, (9,3)=0 (invalid), (9,4)=0 (invalid), (9,5)=0 (invalid). So (8,4)=3 has adjacent cells (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine candidate), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2 (safe). So (8,4)=3: 3 mines in adjacent cells. (7,4)=F is a mine candidate. If it's a mine, then 2 more mines in (8,5). Because (8,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3. Let's see: (8,5) is adjacent to (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=2, (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=1. So (8,5) is adjacent to (8,4)=3. If (8,4)=3 has 3 mines, and (7,4)=F is one, then (8,5) must be a mine (since (7,5)=2 is safe, (7,6)=? is another cell). Wait, (8,4)=3's adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (8,6). So 6 cells. (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2 (safe). So 3 mines needed. So (7,4)=F is 1, so (8,5) must be a mine (2), and (7,6)=? must be a mine (3). Because (8,6)=2 is safe. So (8,4)=3 implies that (7,4)=F, (8,5), and (7,6) are mines. But (7,5)=2 is adjacent to (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,5)=?. (7,5)=2 has 2 mines, so if (7,4)=F and (7,6)=? are mines, that's 2, which matches. So (7,5)=2 would have 2 mines, which fits. So (8,5) and (7,6) would be mines. But this is assuming (7,4)=F is a correct flag.\n\nBut the user's flags are 2\/11, so 2 correct. If (7,4)=F is correct, then (3,2)=F might be incorrect. Let's check (3,2)=F. (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=1. (3,2) is flagged. (3,1)=2: adjacent mines. If (3,2) is a mine, then (3,1)=2 has 1 mine here. (3,1) is 2, so needs 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1). (2,2)=2: adjacent mines. If (3,2) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 has 1 mine here, needs 1 more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So (2,1) could be a mine, which would satisfy both (3,1)=2 and (2,2)=2. So (3,2)=F could be correct, and (2,1) is a mine. Then (2,0) and (1,1), (1,2) are safe.\n\nIf (2,0) is safe, then we can uncover (2,0). Let's check (2,0). (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1. (3,0)=1: adjacent mines. (3,0) is 1, adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=2, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1. So (3,0)=1 has 2 ? cells (2,0), (2,1). Since (3,0)=1, there's 1 mine in those two. If (2,1) is a mine (as per earlier), then (2,0) is safe. So (2,0) is safe. That's a good candidate.\n\nAnother candidate: (1,0). (1,0) is ?. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=?, (0,1)=?, (0,2)=?, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2. (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (2,0), (2,1). (3,1)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2)=F. If (3,2)=F is a mine, then (3,1)=2 has 1 mine here, so 1 more in (2,0), (2,1). So (2,0), (2,1) have 1 mine. (1,0) is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,1). If (2,0) is safe, then (1,0) is adjacent to (2,0)=safe, but (1,0) could still be a mine or safe. Not sure.\n\nLet's go back to (2,0). If (2,0) is safe, uncovering it would show a number or 0. Since (3,0)=1 and (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,1), and (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in those two, if (2,0) is safe, then (2,1) is a mine. So (2,0) is safe. Let's confirm.\n\n(3,0)=1: adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,1)=2 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe). So (3,0)=1 must have 1 mine in (2,0) or (2,1). (3,1)=2: adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,0)=1 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,1)=2 must have 2 mines in (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). If (3,2)=F is a mine, then (3,1)=2 has 1 mine here, so 1 more in (2,0) or (2,1). Which matches (3,0)=1's 1 mine. So (2,0) and (2,1) have 1 mine. Therefore, (2,0) and (2,1) are mutually exclusive: one is a mine, the other is safe.\n\nIf we uncover (2,0), if it's a number, say 1, then (2,1) is a mine. If it's 0, then (2,1) is safe. But since (3,0)=1, (2,0) can't be 0. Because (3,0)=1 is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,1), and if (2,0) is 0, then (2,1) would be the mine, making (3,0)=1 correct. Wait, (2,0) being 0 would mean it has 0 adjacent mines. So (2,0)'s adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,0)=1 (safe), (3,1)=2 (safe), (4,0)=0 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe). So (2,0) being 0 would mean (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) are all safe. But (3,0)=1 has 1 mine in (2,0) or (2,1). If (2,0) is 0 (safe), then (2,1) must be the mine. That works. So (2,0) could be 0, 1, or 2. But since (3,0)=1, (2,0) can't have more than 1 adjacent mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's definitely safe. Let's check (0,4). (0,4) is ?. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1. (1,3)=1: adjacent mines. (1,3) is 1, adjacent cells: (0,2)=?, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0. (2,4)=0 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (1,4)=1 (safe). So (1,3)=1 has 4 ? cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2). So 1 mine among these four. (1,4)=1: adjacent cells (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=0 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (1,3)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe). So (1,4)=1 has 3 ? cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). 1 mine among these three. (1,5)=1: adjacent cells (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (0,6)=?, (1,4)=1, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1. (2,4)=0 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=1 (safe), (1,4)=1 (safe), (1,6)=1 (safe). So (1,5)=1 has 3 ? cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6). 1 mine among these three.\n\nSo (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1 all have overlapping ? cells in (0,4), (0,5). Let's say (0,4) is a mine. Then (1,4)=1 would have 1 mine here, which fits. (1,5)=1 would need 1 mine in (0,5) or (0,6). (1,3)=1 would need 1 mine in (0,2), (0,3), (1,2). That's possible. But (0,4) could be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 4, column 4 is 0 (4,4). Its adjacent cells are all uncovered. So no help.\n\nRow 5, column 0 is 0 (5,0). Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0 is 0 (6,0). Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 0 is 0 (7,0). Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 0 is 0 (8,0). Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nHow about row 4, column 6 (4,6)? Let's see its adjacent cells. (4,6) is adjacent to (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. (3,6)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which include (4,6). If (4,6) is safe, then the 2 mines are in (2,7) and (3,7). If (4,6) is a mine, then one mine is here, and another in (2,7) or (3,7). But we don't know.\n\nAnother approach: the user has 2 correct flags out of 11. So 9 flags are incorrect. The total mines are 10. So there are 10 mines, 2 correctly flagged, 9 incorrectly flagged (so 2+9=11 flags placed). So 10-2=8 mines are unflagged. So there are 8 mines remaining that are not flagged. We need to uncover safe cells (non-mine, non-flagged).\n\nThe safest bet is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, but all 0-adjacent cells are already uncovered. Next, look for cells adjacent to 1s that have only one possible mine.\n\nWait, let's look at row 5, column 7 (5,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=0. (5,8)=0 (safe), (6,8)=0 (safe). (4,7)=1 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe). So (5,7)=1 has 1 ? cell: (4,6). So (5,7)=1 means (4,6) is a mine. Because there's only one adjacent ? cell, so it must be a mine. Oh! That's a key point.\n\n(5,7) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). Of these, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=0 are all uncovered (safe). Only (4,6) is ?. So (5,7)=1 must have exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which can only be (4,6). Therefore, (4,6) is a mine. So we shouldn't uncover (4,6).\n\nSimilarly, let's check other 1s with only one ? adjacent.\n\nRow 5, column 6 (5,6)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1. All except (4,6) are safe. So (5,6)=1 also indicates (4,6) is a mine. So (4,6) is definitely a mine.\n\nRow 4, column 7 (4,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,6)=2, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=?, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0. (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0 are safe. (3,6)=2 is a number (safe). So (4,7)=1 has 3 ? cells: (3,7), (3,8), (4,6). Since we know (4,6) is a mine (from (5,6)=1 and (5,7)=1), then (4,7)=1 has 1 mine (4,6), so the other ? cells (3,7), (3,8) must be safe. Because (4,7)=1 has 1 mine total. So (3,7) and (3,8) are safe. That's a good lead!\n\nSo (4,7)=1: adjacent mines. We know (4,6) is a mine (from (5,6)=1 and (5,7)=1), so (4,7)=1 has 1 mine here. Therefore, the other adjacent ? cells (3,7), (3,8) must be safe (since 1 mine total). So (3,7) and (3,8) are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLet's confirm:\n\n(5,7)=1: adjacent cells. Only (4,6) is ?, so (4,6) is a mine. Correct.\n\n(5,6)=1: adjacent cells. Only (4,6) is ?, so (4,6) is a mine. Correct.\n\n(4,7)=1: adjacent mines. (4,6) is a mine, so that's 1. The other adjacent cells (3,7), (3,8), (3,6)=2 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,6)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=0 (safe). So (4,7)=1 has exactly 1 mine (4,6), so (3,7) and (3,8) are safe. Therefore, we can safely uncover (3,7) or (3,8).\n\nLet's pick (3,7). The current state of (3,7) is ?. Since we deduced it's safe, uncovering it will show a number.\n\nAnother check: (3,6)=2. Its adjacent cells are (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=?, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=mine, (4,7)=1. So (3,6)=2 has 2 mines. We know (4,6) is a mine, so there's 1 more mine in (2,7) or (3,7). But we deduced (3,7) is safe (from (4,7)=1), so the remaining mine must be in (2,7). So (2,7) is a mine, (3,7) is safe. That confirms (3,7) is safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to uncover (3,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,7)","uncover (3,7)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 10 columns in some rows? Maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed. There are 10 mines total, and the player has flagged 2 mines so far (since Flags: 2\/11, but total mines are 10, so maybe 2 correct, 1 incorrect). The score is 0.1818, which is 2\/11, but the actual correct flags should be 2 out of 10, so maybe 11 flags placed in total, 2 correct, 9 incorrect. The goal is to flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse each row. Let's index rows from 0 to 8 and columns 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Let's list the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 columns, maybe the original had a typo with 10)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (columns 0-8)\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\nRow 3: 1 2 F 1 0 1 2 2 ? ? (F at (3,2))\nRow 4: 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? 1 1 1 (maybe column 8 is 1)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 (row 5, columns 0-8)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 (row 6)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 F 2 ? ? 1 0 (F at (7,4))\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 3 ? 2 1 1 0 (row 8)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 ? ? 1 0 0 0 (Wait, 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Maybe the user input has row numbers up to 9, but that's a mistake. Let's assume rows are 0-8, columns 0-8. So row 8 is the last row.)\n\nLet me correct the rows to 9x9:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-8: all ?\nRow 1: [0]?, [1]?, [2]?, [3]1, [4]1, [5]1, [6]1, [7]?, [8]?\nRow 2: [0]?, [1]?, [2]2, [3]1, [4]0, [5]0, [6]1, [7]?, [8]?\nRow 3: [0]1, [1]2, [2]F, [3]1, [4]0, [5]1, [6]2, [7]2, [8]?\nRow 4: [0]0, [1]1, [2]1, [3]1, [4]0, [5]1, [6]?, [7]1, [8]1\nRow 5: [0]0, [0]0, [1]0, [2]0, [3]0, [4]0, [5]1, [6]1, [7]1, [8]0 (Wait, row 5 should be 9 columns. Let's list each row properly with 9 columns (0-8):\n\nRow 0: [0]?, [1]?, [2]?, [3]?, [4]?, [5]?, [6]?, [7]?, [8]?\nRow 1: [0]?, [1]?, [2]?, [3]1, [4]1, [5]1, [6]1, [7]?, [8]?\nRow 2: [0]?, [1]?, [2]2, [3]1, [4]0, [5]0, [6]1, [7]?, [8]?\nRow 3: [0]1, [1]2, [2]F, [3]1, [4]0, [5]1, [6]2, [7]2, [8]?\nRow 4: [0]0, [1]1, [2]1, [3]1, [4]0, [5]1, [6]?, [7]1, [8]1\nRow 5: [0]0, [1]0, [2]0, [3]0, [4]0, [5]1, [6]1, [7]1, [8]0\nRow 6: [0]0, [1]0, [2]0, [3]1, [4]1, [5]1, [6]1, [7]1, [8]1\nRow 7: [0]0, [1]0, [2]0, [3]1, [4]F, [5]2, [6]?, [7]?, [8]1\nRow 8: [0]0, [1]0, [2]0, [3]2, [4]3, [5]?, [6]2, [7]1, [8]1\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover (i.e., cells that are '?' and can be determined to be safe based on adjacent numbers).\n\nFirst, let's check cells with 0, which mean all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 2, column 4 is 0 (row 2, col 4). Its adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). Let's see if those are already uncovered. (1,3) is 1, (1,4) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,3) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 0, (3,5) is 1. So the 0 at (2,4) is already surrounded by uncovered cells, so no new info there.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 0 (row 3, col 4). Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. All adjacent cells are uncovered, so no help.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 0 (row 4, col 4). Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. All uncovered, so no new cells to uncover here.\n\nRow 5, column 0-4 are 0s. Let's check row 5, column 0 (0,0). Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (5,1)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0. All uncovered. Similarly, row 5, column 1 is 0, adjacent cells all uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 0-2 are 0s. For example, row 6, column 0: adjacent cells (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (6,1)=0, (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at cells with numbers that have adjacent '?' and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines.\n\nTake row 3, column 1 is 2 (row 3, col 1). Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0)=1, (3,2)=F, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So the 2 at (3,1) has adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) are ?, (3,2) is F (flagged as mine), (3,0)=1, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. The 2 needs exactly 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The F at (3,2) is a flagged mine. So if that F is correct, then there should be 1 more mine in (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). If the F is incorrect, then there are 2 mines in those three cells. But we don't know yet.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 2 (row 7, col 5). Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2. The 2 at (7,5) has adjacent cells: (6,4)=1 (safe), (6,5)=1 (safe), (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F (flagged), (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2 (safe). So the 2 needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The F at (7,4) is a possible mine. If F is correct, then the remaining mine is in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5). If F is incorrect, then 2 mines in those three.\n\nRow 8, column 3 is 2 (row 8, col 3). Adjacent cells: (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2)=0 (assuming row 9 is a mistake, maybe row 8 is last), (9,3)=1 (again, row 9 is probably a typo, so row 8, col 3's adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (8,3 is itself), (8,3's adjacent is (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (9,2) and (9,3) don't exist. So 2 at (8,3) has adjacent cells (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine?), (8,2)=0 (safe), (8,4)=3 (safe), and (8,3) is 2. So the 2's adjacent mines: if F is correct, then 1 mine, so maybe another mine in (8,3) adjacent? Not sure.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 3 (row 8, col 4). Adjacent cells: (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (9,3)=1 (typo), (9,4)=?, (9,5)=? (typo). So 3 needs 3 mines. If F at (7,4) is correct, then 2 more mines in (7,5) adjacent cells? (7,5) is 2, which is adjacent to (8,4)=3. The 3's adjacent cells: (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2 (safe), (8,3)=2 (safe), (8,5)=?, (8,4 is itself). So the 3 has (7,4)=F (1 mine), and needs 2 more mines in (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) but rows 9 are invalid. So (8,5) is adjacent, and (7,5) is 2, which is adjacent to (8,4)=3. The 2 at (7,5) has adjacent cells (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (7,4)=F, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2. So 2 mines here. If F is correct, then 1 mine in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). But (8,6)=2, which is a number, so safe. So (6,6), (7,6), (8,5) are ?. So 2 mines in those three. The 3 at (8,4) needs 3 mines: F (1) + 2 from (7,5)'s 2 mines. That adds up: 1+2=3. So that's possible. So (7,5) has 2 mines in (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), which would satisfy the 3 at (8,4). So those cells could be mines, but we need to find safe cells.\n\nLooking for cells that are '?' and adjacent to 0s. For example, row 4, column 6 is ? (row 4, col 6). Let's check its adjacent cells. Row 4, col 6 is at (4,6). Adjacent cells: (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=2, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=1. All these are numbers, so none are 0. So (4,6) is adjacent to numbers, but no 0s, so can't be sure.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is ? (row 7, col 6). Adjacent cells: (6,5)=1, (6,6)=?, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=2, (7,7)=?, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2, (8,7)=1. So (7,6) is adjacent to 2 (7,5) and 2 (8,6), but not 0s.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is ? (row 8, col 5). Adjacent cells: (7,4)=F, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (8,4)=3, (8,6)=2, (9,4)=?, (9,5)=? (typo). So (8,5) is adjacent to 3 and 2, not 0s.\n\nRow 0: all ?. Maybe not safe to uncover yet.\n\nRow 1, columns 0-2 are ?. Adjacent to row 1, col 3=1. So row 1, col 2 is adjacent to row 2, col 2=2. Row 2, col 2=2 (row 2, col 2) has adjacent cells: (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=2, (3,2)=F, (3,3)=1. So 2 at (2,2) needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), (3,2)=F. (3,2) is F, so if that's a mine, then 1 mine already, so 1 more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,1). (3,1) is 2, which is a number, so safe. So (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) are ?. So 1 mine among these three. So row 1, col 2 is adjacent to 2 (row 2, col 2) and 1 (row 1, col 3). Maybe not safe.\n\nRow 3, column 8 is ? (row 3, col 8). Adjacent cells: (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,7)=2, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. (3,7)=2, which has adjacent cells (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. The 2 at (3,7) needs 2 mines. Its adjacent ? cells are (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,6). So 2 mines in those four. So (3,8) could be a mine or safe.\n\nLooking for cells that are adjacent to 0s. Let's check row 5, column 5 is 1 (row 5, col 5). Adjacent to row 5, col 5: (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1. The 0 at (4,4) means all adjacent cells are safe, which they are (already uncovered). So no new info.\n\nRow 6, column 3 is 1 (row 6, col 3). Adjacent cells: (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F. So 1 at (6,3) has adjacent cells: (5,2-4)=0 (safe), (6,2)=0 (safe), (6,4)=1 (safe), (7,2)=0 (safe), (7,3)=1 (safe), (7,4)=F (mine?). So the 1 needs 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The F at (7,4) is adjacent, so if F is correct, then that's the mine, so (6,3) is satisfied. So F at (7,4) is likely a correct mine because it satisfies the 1 at (6,3). Let's note that: (7,4) is F, and (6,3)=1. (6,3) has 8 adjacent cells, 7 of which are safe (0 or numbers), so the 8th is (7,4), which must be a mine. So (7,4) is a correct flag! That's good. So that's 1 correct flag.\n\nNow, row 3, column 2 is F (row 3, col 2). Let's check its adjacent numbers. (3,1)=2, (2,2)=2, (4,2)=1. Let's check (3,1)=2: adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=F, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=F, (4,0)=0, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1) is 2, and has two Fs adjacent: (2,2) and (3,2). Wait, (2,2) is row 2, column 2, which is 2 (number), not F. Wait, row 3, column 2 is F. So (3,1) is 2, adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2 (number), (3,0)=1 (number), (3,2)=F (flag), (4,0)=0 (number), (4,1)=1 (number), (4,2)=1 (number). So the 2 at (3,1) has only one adjacent flagged cell (3,2). So it needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The possible mines are (2,0), (2,1), (3,2). So if (3,2) is a mine, then one mine, and another in (2,0) or (2,1). If (3,2) is not a mine, then two mines in (2,0) and (2,1). Let's check (2,2)=2 (row 2, column 2). Its adjacent cells are (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=1 (number), (2,1)=?, (2,3)=1 (number), (3,1)=2 (number), (3,2)=F (flag), (3,3)=1 (number). So 2 at (2,2) needs 2 mines. Adjacent ? cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and flagged (3,2). So if (3,2) is a mine, then 1 mine, so 1 more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). If (3,2) is not a mine, then 2 mines in those three. Now, (4,2)=1 (row 4, column 2). Adjacent cells: (3,1)=2 (number), (3,2)=F (flag), (3,3)=1 (number), (4,1)=1 (number), (4,3)=1 (number), (5,1)=0 (number), (5,2)=0 (number), (5,3)=0 (number). So 1 at (4,2) needs 1 mine. The only adjacent ? is (3,2)=F. So if (3,2) is a mine, then (4,2) is satisfied (1 mine). So (3,2) is likely a correct mine because (4,2)=1 has only one adjacent cell that could be a mine (the F at (3,2)), so that must be a mine. So that's another correct flag. So Flags: 2\/11, but those two (3,2) and (7,4) are correct. The other 9 flags are incorrect.\n\nNow, the total mines are 10, so there are 8 more mines to find. But maybe we can find safe cells to uncover.\n\nLet's look for cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, meaning the remaining adjacent ? are safe. For example, if a cell has number 2 and there are 2 flags adjacent, then the other adjacent ? are safe.\n\nTake row 6, column 3=1. Adjacent flags: (7,4)=F (correct mine). So 1 flag, which equals the number 1. So all other adjacent cells to (6,3) are safe. The adjacent cells to (6,3) are (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,3), (7,4). All except (7,4) are uncovered and safe (numbers or 0), so no new info.\n\nRow 4, column 2=1. Adjacent flags: (3,2)=F (correct mine). So 1 flag, which equals the number 1. So all other adjacent cells to (4,2) are safe. The adjacent cells are (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (4,1), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). All except (3,2) are uncovered and safe, so no new info.\n\nRow 3, column 1=2. Adjacent flags: (3,2)=F (correct mine). So 1 flag, needs 1 more mine. So the other adjacent ? cells (2,0), (2,1) could have 1 mine. So not safe to uncover those.\n\nRow 7, column 5=2. Adjacent flags: (7,4)=F (correct mine). So 1 flag, needs 1 more mine. Adjacent ? cells: (6,6), (7,6), (8,5). So 1 mine among these three. So those could be mines, but not sure.\n\nRow 8, column 3=2. Adjacent flags: (7,4)=F (correct mine). Adjacent cells: (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F, (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3, (8,3) is the cell itself. So 2 at (8,3) has 1 mine (F), so needs 1 more mine. Adjacent ? cells: none, since (8,3) is 2 and adjacent cells are mostly uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 2=2. Adjacent flags: (3,2)=F (correct mine). So 1 mine, needs 1 more in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So those are possible mines.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are '?' and have all adjacent numbers satisfied, meaning they are safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a number that has already accounted for all its mines via flags, then the cell is safe.\n\nTake row 4, column 6=? (row 4, col 6). Let's check its adjacent numbers:\n\n- (3,5)=1: adjacent cells. (3,5) is 1, which has adjacent cells (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?. The 1 at (3,5) needs 1 mine. Its adjacent cells: (2,6)=1 (number), (3,6)=2 (number), (4,6)=? (unknown). The rest are 0s (safe). So (3,5)=1 has only (4,6) as a possible mine. So if (4,6) is a mine, then (3,5)=1 is satisfied. If not, then (3,5)=1 would have 0 mines, which is impossible. Wait, (3,5)=1's adjacent cells: (2,4)=0 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (2,6)=1 (safe), (3,4)=0 (safe), (3,6)=2 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (4,6)=?. So the only possible mine is (4,6). Therefore, (3,5)=1 must have (4,6) as a mine. Because 1 mine is needed, and only (4,6) is unknown. So (4,6) must be a mine! Oh, that's a key point.\n\nLet me verify: (3,5) is at row 3, column 5. Its eight adjacent cells are:\n\n- (2,4): 0 (safe)\n- (2,5): 0 (safe)\n- (2,6): 1 (safe)\n- (3,4): 0 (safe)\n- (3,6): 2 (safe)\n- (4,4): 0 (safe)\n- (4,5): 1 (safe)\n- (4,6): ? (unknown)\n\nSo all adjacent cells except (4,6) are safe (0 or numbers, which are safe because numbers indicate adjacent mines, not mines themselves). So the 1 at (3,5) means there is exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Since all others are safe, (4,6) must be the mine. Therefore, (4,6) is a mine. So we should flag (4,6). But the current action could be to uncover a safe cell. Wait, but the user's current action could be to uncover a cell that's safe.\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. Let's look at row 5, column 6=1 (row 5, col 6). Adjacent cells: (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1. The 1 at (5,6) needs 1 mine. Its adjacent ? is (4,6). So if (4,6) is a mine, then (5,6)=1 is satisfied. Which aligns with the previous conclusion. So (4,6) is a mine.\n\nNow, row 3, column 6=2 (row 3, col 6). Adjacent cells: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=2, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1. The 2 at (3,6) needs 2 mines. Its adjacent ? cells are (2,7) and (4,6). We just determined (4,6) is a mine, so (2,7) must be the other mine to make 2. So (2,7) is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 7=2 (row 3, col 7). Adjacent cells: (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. The 2 at (3,7) needs 2 mines. We know (2,7) and (4,6) are mines (from above), so that's 2 mines. So the other ? cells (2,8), (3,8) are safe. So (2,8) and (3,8) are safe to uncover.\n\nLet's confirm: (3,7)=2 has adjacent mines at (2,7) and (4,6), so that's 2 mines, which matches the number 2. Therefore, the other adjacent ? cells (2,8), (3,8) are safe. So we can uncover (2,8) or (3,8).\n\nLet's check (2,8): row 2, column 8. Adjacent cells: (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?, (2,7)=? (mine), (3,7)=2, (3,8)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. Since (2,7) is a mine, and (3,7)=2 has 2 mines (including (2,7)), then (2,8) is safe.\n\n(3,8): row 3, column 8. Adjacent cells: (2,7)=mine, (2,8)=safe (as above), (3,7)=2, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. Since (3,7)=2 has 2 mines (2,7 and 4,6), then (3,8) is safe.\n\nSo either (2,8) or (3,8) is a safe cell to uncover. Let's pick one. Let's choose (3,8) as it's in row 3, column 8.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,8)","uncover (3,8)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. Let's start by looking at the existing numbers and flags. \n\nThe user has flagged 2 mines, but there are 10 total. The score is 0.18, which is 2\/11, but maybe that's a typo? Anyway, the goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the board, let's parse the rows. The rows are 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9, but the given board shows 10 columns? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let's check each row's length. The first row is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which is 10, but it should be 9. Maybe a typo in the input. Let's assume each row is 9 cells, so perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the board. Let's adjust:\n\nRow 0: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (9 cells)\nRow 1: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ? (9 cells)\nRow 2: ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? (9)\nRow 3: 1 2 F 1 0 1 2 2 2 ? (Wait, 10 again. Maybe the user just added an extra, but the actual game is 9x9. Let's proceed, assuming the coordinates are (row, col) where row and col are 0-8.)\n\nLooking at row 3, column 2 is flagged (F). Let's check adjacent cells. For example, row 2, column 2 is 2. The cell (2,2) has value 2, meaning 2 mines in adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2) is 2. Let's see which of these are flagged or uncovered. (3,2) is F (flagged), so that's one mine. Are there others? (1,2) is ?, (1,1) is ?, (1,3) is 1 (uncovered), (2,1) is ?, (2,3) is 1 (uncovered), (3,1) is 2 (uncovered), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered). So the 2 in (2,2) must have exactly 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Since (3,2) is flagged, there's one mine there. So there's one more mine in the adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1 is 2. The cell (3,1) has value 2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,2) is F (mine), (2,2) is 2 (uncovered), (3,0) is 1 (uncovered), (4,0) is 0 (uncovered), (4,1) is 1 (uncovered), (4,2) is 1 (uncovered), (2,0) is ? (unknown), (2,1) is ? (unknown). So (3,1)=2 has 2 mines. Since (3,2) is F (one mine), the other mine must be in (2,0) or (2,1).\n\nRow 2, column 0 is ?. Let's check row 3, column 0: (3,0) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,0)=1, so 1 mine in these. (3,1) is 2 (uncovered), (4,0)=0 (uncovered), (4,1)=1 (uncovered). So the mine must be in (2,0) or (2,1). But (3,1) has 2 mines, one of which is (3,2) F, and the other must be in (2,0) or (2,1). So if (3,0)=1, then exactly one mine in (2,0) or (2,1). Therefore, (2,0) and (2,1) must have exactly one mine between them. Because (3,0)=1 and (3,1)=2 (with one mine already in (3,2)), so (2,0) and (2,1) contribute 1 mine to (3,0) and 1 mine to (3,1). That makes sense: (2,0) or (2,1) is a mine.\n\nNow, let's look at row 7, column 4: (7,4) is F (flagged). Let's check the cell (7,3) which is 1. (7,3) has value 1. Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (7,4) is F (mine), so that's one. (6,3) is 1 (uncovered), (6,4) is 1 (uncovered), (7,2) is 0 (uncovered), (8,2) is 0 (uncovered), (8,3) is 2 (uncovered), (8,4) is ? (unknown). (6,2) is 0 (uncovered). So (7,3)=1 has one mine, which is (7,4) F. That checks out. So that flag is probably correct.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 5: (7,5) is 2. Adjacent cells: (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6). (7,4) is F (mine), (6,4)=1 (uncovered), (6,5)=1 (uncovered), (6,6)=? (unknown), (7,6)=? (unknown), (8,4)=3 (uncovered), (8,5)=? (unknown), (8,6)=2 (uncovered). So (7,5)=2 has 2 mines. One is (7,4) F, so there's one more mine in the adjacent cells: (6,5), (6,6), (7,6), (8,5), (8,6). Wait, (6,5) is 1 (uncovered), so it's safe. (6,6) is ?, (7,6) is ?, (8,5) is ?, (8,6)=2.\n\nRow 8, column 3 is 2. (8,3) has value 2. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Wait, row 8 is the last row (0-8), so (9,2) etc. don't exist. So (8,3) adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4). (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F (mine), (8,2)=0, (8,4)=3 (uncovered). So (8,3)=2. Since (7,4) is a mine (1), there's 1 more mine. But (8,4) is 3, which is adjacent to (8,3), (8,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (9,4) (invalid), (9,5) (invalid), (9,3) (invalid). So (8,4)=3. Its adjacent cells are (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F (mine), (7,5)=2, (8,3)=2, (8,5)=?, (8,4) itself. So (8,4)=3 means 3 mines in adjacent cells. (7,4) is 1 mine, so 2 more mines in (7,5), (8,3), (8,5). But (8,3)=2, which has 2 mines, one of which is (7,4), so the other must be (8,4) adjacent? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look for safe cells to uncover. The 0 cells are good because they reveal all adjacent cells. For example, row 4, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). All of these are uncovered (3,0)=1, (3,1)=2, (4,1)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0). So that's already revealed.\n\nRow 5, column 0-4 are 0s. So (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. These 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (5,5)=1. (5,5) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1. So (5,5)=1. Since (4,4)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (6,5)=1, (5,6)=1 are all safe, the mine must be in (4,6) or (6,6).\n\nRow 6, column 0-3 are 0s: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1. (6,3)=1, so one mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells: (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=0, (7,3)=1, (7,4)=F (mine). So (6,3)=1. The adjacent cells include (7,4)=F (mine), so that's one. So (6,3)=1 is satisfied because (7,4) is a mine. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 is 0. (3,4)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells are (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=1. All of these are uncovered (since (3,4)=0 is uncovered), so that area is safe.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 2, column 4 and 5 are 0s. (2,4)=0 and (2,5)=0. Their adjacent cells are all safe. Let's check (2,4)=0: adjacent cells (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1. All uncovered. So no new info there.\n\nRow 1, column 3-6 are 1s: (1,3)=1, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=1. Let's take (1,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=?, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,4)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0. So (1,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (2,2)=2 is adjacent, which we know has 2 mines (one is (3,2) F). The adjacent cells for (1,3)=1 are (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,2) is 2 (uncovered), (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,4)=0 (uncovered). So the mine must be in (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2).\n\nBut maybe there's a 0 cell that can reveal more. Let's check row 4, column 4=0. Its adjacent cells are (3,3)=1, (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,3)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1. All uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 2=0. (7,2)=0. Adjacent cells: (6,1)=0, (6,2)=0, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0, (8,3)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 0-2 are 0s: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=0. Their adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are marked as '?' and see if we can determine if they are safe. For example, row 3, column 8 is '?'. Let's check (3,8). The cell (3,7)=2, (3,8)=?, (3,6)=2. (3,7)=2: adjacent cells (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. (3,7)=2 has 2 mines. (2,6)=1 (uncovered), (3,6)=2 (uncovered), (4,7)=1 (uncovered), (4,8)=1 (uncovered). So the mines could be in (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,6). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7, column 6: (7,6) is '?'. The cell (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=1, (8,5)=?, (8,6)=2. (6,6)=1: adjacent cells (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (6,5)=1, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?. (6,6)=1 has 1 mine. The adjacent cells (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1, (6,5)=1, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=2 are uncovered. So the mine is in (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). \n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which would mean it's safe. For example, let's check row 5, column 5=1. Its adjacent cells include (4,6)=?, which is adjacent to (4,5)=1. (4,5)=1: adjacent cells (3,4)=0, (3,5)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=?, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1. (4,5)=1 has 1 mine. (3,4)=0, (4,4)=0, (5,4)=0 are safe. (3,5)=1, (5,5)=1, (5,6)=1 are uncovered. So the mine must be in (3,6) or (4,6). (3,6)=2: adjacent cells (2,5)=0, (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=1, (3,7)=2, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1. (3,6)=2 has 2 mines. (2,5)=0, (3,5)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,7)=1 are safe. (2,6)=1 is uncovered. So the mines are in (2,7), (3,7), (4,6). (3,7)=2: adjacent cells (2,6)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,8)=?, (4,6)=?, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1. (3,7)=2 has 2 mines, so possible (2,7), (2,8), (3,8), (4,6). \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe look for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check row 0, column 4: (0,4). The cell (1,4)=1. (1,4)=1's adjacent cells are (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0. Since (2,4)=0 and (2,5)=0, their adjacent cells are safe, so (1,4)=1's adjacent cells (2,3)=1, (2,4)=0, (2,5)=0 are safe. So (1,4)=1 has 1 mine in (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5). (1,3)=1 and (1,5)=1 are uncovered, so they are safe. So the mine is in (0,3), (0,4), (0,5). But (0,4) is adjacent to (1,4)=1. If (0,4) is a mine, then (1,4)=1 is satisfied. But we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7, column 7: (7,7) is '?'. The cell (7,8)=1. (7,8)=1's adjacent cells are (6,7)=1, (6,8)=0, (6,9) invalid, (7,7)=?, (7,9) invalid, (8,7)=1, (8,8)=1, (8,9) invalid. (6,8)=0 and (8,8)=1 are uncovered. So (7,8)=1 has 1 mine in (6,7)=1, (7,7)=?, (8,7)=1. (6,7)=1 is uncovered (safe), (8,7)=1 is uncovered (safe), so (7,7) must be a mine? Wait, no: (6,7)=1 is a number, meaning it's safe (it's uncovered). So (7,8)=1's adjacent cells: (6,7) is safe (it's a number), (6,8)=0 (safe), (7,7)=?, (8,7)=1 (safe), (8,8)=1 (safe). So the mine must be in (7,7). Because (7,8)=1 has 1 mine, and the only unknown is (7,7). So (7,7) is a mine. But wait, (7,7) is adjacent to (7,8)=1, so if (7,7) is a mine, then (7,8)=1 is correct. But let's check (6,7)=1: (6,7) has adjacent cells (5,6)=1, (5,7)=?, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,8)=0, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=1. (6,7)=1 has 1 mine. (5,6)=1 (safe), (5,8)=0 (safe), (6,6)=1 (safe), (6,8)=0 (safe), (7,8)=1 (safe). So the mine is in (5,7), (7,6), (7,7). If (7,7) is a mine, then (6,7)=1 is satisfied. But (7,8)=1 also requires (7,7) to be a mine. So (7,7) is a mine. Should we flag it? But the user has only flagged 2, and there are 10 mines. But maybe we can uncover a safe cell.\n\nWait, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 8=0. (5,8)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=0. All of these are uncovered, so no new info.\n\nRow 6, column 8=0. (6,8)=0. Adjacent cells (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0, (5,9) invalid, (6,7)=1, (6,9) invalid, (7,7)=?, (7,8)=1, (7,9) invalid. (5,7)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,8)=1 are uncovered. So (6,8)=0's adjacent cells are safe, which means (7,7) and (7,8) are safe? Wait, no. 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. So (6,8)=0's adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8). Since (6,8)=0, all of these must be safe (not mines). So (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8) are safe. That's a key point!\n\nYes! (6,8)=0 is an uncovered cell with value 0, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe (no mines). Let's list (6,8)'s adjacent cells:\n\nRow 5, column 7: (5,7)\nRow 5, column 8: (5,8) (which is 0, so safe)\nRow 6, column 7: (6,7)\nRow 7, column 7: (7,7)\nRow 7, column 8: (7,8)\nAlso, row 5, column 9 is invalid, row 6, column 9 invalid, row 7, column 9 invalid. So the valid adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nSince (6,8)=0, all these cells are safe (no mines). Therefore:\n\n- (5,7) is safe (can be uncovered)\n- (6,7) is safe (already uncovered as 1)\n- (7,7) is safe (can be uncovered)\n- (7,8) is safe (already uncovered as 1)\n\nSo (5,7) and (7,7) are safe and currently marked as '?'. So we can uncover them.\n\nLet's check (5,7): current board shows row 5 as \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" but assuming 9 cells, row 5 is columns 0-8: \"0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\". So (5,7) is 1 (uncovered). Wait, maybe I messed up the row indices. Let's re-express the board properly, assuming each row is 9 columns (0-8):\n\nRow 0: [0,0] to [0,8] → all ?\nRow 1: [1,0]?, [1,1]?, [1,2]?, [1,3]1, [1,4]1, [1,5]1, [1,6]1, [1,7]?, [1,8]?\nRow 2: [2,0]?, [2,1]?, [2,2]2, [2,3]1, [2,4]0, [2,5]0, [2,6]1, [2,7]?, [2,8]?\nRow 3: [3,0]1, [3,1]2, [3,2]F, [3,3]1, [3,4]0, [3,5]1, [3,6]2, [3,7]2, [3,8]2\nRow 4: [4,0]0, [4,1]1, [4,2]1, [4,3]1, [4,4]0, [4,5]1, [4,6]?, [4,7]1, [4,8]1\nRow 5: [5,0]0, [5,1]0, [5,2]0, [5,3]0, [5,4]0, [5,5]1, [5,6]1, [5,7]1, [5,8]0\nRow 6: [6,0]0, [6,1]0, [6,2]0, [6,3]1, [6,4]1, [6,5]1, [6,6]1, [6,7]1, [6,8]0\nRow 7: [7,0]0, [7,1]0, [7,2]0, [7,3]1, [7,4]F, [7,5]2, [7,6]?, [7,7]?, [7,8]1\nRow 8: [8,0]0, [8,1]0, [8,2]0, [8,3]2, [8,4]3, [8,5]?, [8,6]2, [8,7]1, [8,8]0\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So row 6, column 8 is 0 ([6,8]=0). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n- [5,7]: [5,7] is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- [5,8]: [5,8] is 0 (uncovered, safe)\n- [6,7]: [6,7] is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- [7,7]: [7,7] is ? (unknown)\n- [7,8]: [7,8] is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- Also, [5,6] (row 5, column 6) is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- [6,6] (row 6, column 6) is 1 (uncovered, safe)\n- [7,6] (row 7, column 6) is ? (unknown)\n\nWait, 0's adjacent cells are all 8 surrounding cells. For [6,8], the adjacent cells are:\n\n- (5,7), (5,8), (5,9) → (5,9) invalid\n- (6,7), (6,9) → (6,9) invalid\n- (7,7), (7,8), (7,9) → (7,9) invalid\n\nSo valid adjacent cells are (5,7), (5,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,8). Since [6,8]=0, all these must be safe (no mines). (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=0 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe), (7,8)=1 (safe). Therefore, (7,7) must be safe (not a mine). So we can uncover (7,7).\n\nAnother 0 cell: [3,4]=0. Its adjacent cells are all safe. Let's check [3,4]=0's adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). All of these are uncovered (values 1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1), so no new info.\n\nLooking at [4,6]=? (row 4, column 6). Let's check adjacent cells. [4,6] is adjacent to [3,5]=1, [3,6]=2, [3,7]=2, [4,5]=1, [4,7]=1, [5,5]=1, [5,6]=1, [5,7]=1. [3,6]=2: adjacent cells are [2,5]=0, [2,6]=1, [2,7]=?, [3,5]=1, [3,7]=2, [4,5]=1, [4,6]=?, [4,7]=1. [3,6]=2 has 2 mines. [2,5]=0 (safe), [3,5]=1 (safe), [4,5]=1 (safe), [4,7]=1 (safe), [2,6]=1 (safe). So the mines are in [2,7] and [4,6], or [2,7] and [3,7], or [3,7] and [4,6]. [3,7]=2: adjacent cells [2,6]=1, [2,7]=?, [2,8]=?, [3,6]=2, [3,8]=2, [4,6]=?, [4,7]=1, [4,8]=1. [3,7]=2 has 2 mines. [2,6]=1 (safe), [3,6]=2 (safe), [4,7]=1 (safe), [4,8]=1 (safe). So mines in [2,7], [2,8], [3,8], [4,6]. If [3,6]=2 and [3,7]=2 both need 2 mines, maybe [2,7] and [4,6] are mines. But not sure.\n\nBut back to [7,7] which we determined is safe. Let's confirm: [6,8]=0, so (7,7) is adjacent and must be safe. So uncovering (7,7) is safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: [7,6]. Let's check [7,5]=2 (row 7, column 5). [7,5] is 2, adjacent cells are [6,4]=1, [6,5]=1, [6,6]=1, [7,4]=F (mine), [7,6]=?, [8,4]=3, [8,5]=?, [8,6]=2. [7,5]=2 has 2 mines. One is [7,4]=F, so one more mine. The possible cells are [6,5], [6,6], [7,6], [8,5], [8,6]. But [6,5]=1 and [6,6]=1 are uncovered (safe), so the mine must be in [7,6], [8,5], or [8,6]. Not sure, but [7,6] might be a mine.\n\nBut [7,7] is safe, so let's uncover that. So the action should be to uncover (7,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,7)","uncover (7,7)"],"unflags":0,"seed":2,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to figure out what action to take in this Minesweeper game. First, let's recap the rules. The board is 9x9, so rows and columns go from 0 to 8, right? The initial board is all '?', which means unknown. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines. The game ends at 100 moves or if I uncover a mine. The score is correct flags over total mines (10).\n\nSince the board is completely unknown, my first move should probably be to uncover a cell. In Minesweeper, the first move is usually safe and often reveals a large area. The best strategy for the first move is to pick a corner or edge to potentially reveal more cells, but since all are unknown, any cell is fine. Let's pick a middle cell, maybe (4,4), but maybe a corner is better. Wait, (0,0) is a corner. Let's go with (0,0) as the first move. So the action would be 'uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to look at the current board provided. Wait, the current board shown has rows 0 to 14? Because the first line is row 0: \"0 1 ? ? ...\" and row 1: \"2 3 ? ...\", then rows 2 to 14 are all \"?\". But Minesweeper is supposed to be a 9x9 grid. Maybe there's a formatting error here. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in writing the board. Let's assume that it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8. Let's check the input again. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so the rows should be 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nLooking at the current board as presented, maybe the first two rows (row 0 and row 1) have some uncovered cells. Let's parse row 0: \"0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" – that's 13 characters, which is too long. Maybe it's a typo, and each row should have 9 cells. Let's assume that row 0 is \"0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" (columns 0-8), row 1 is \"2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\", and rows 2-8 are all \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\".\n\nSo row 0 has cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, and the rest (0,2)-(0,8) are ?. Row 1 has (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, and (1,2)-(1,8) are ?. The rest of the board (rows 2-8, all columns) are ?.\n\nNow, in Minesweeper, a cell with 0 means there are no mines in its 8 adjacent cells, so all adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered automatically. Let's check cell (0,0)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3. So those are already uncovered, which makes sense because a 0 cell would have all adjacent cells uncovered. So (0,0) being 0 is consistent with its neighbors being uncovered.\n\nNext, cell (0,1)=1. This means there is 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,1) are: (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,2) (unknown), (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2) (unknown). So the possible mine locations for (0,1)'s 1 mine are (0,2), (1,2). Because (0,0) is safe, (1,0) and (1,1) are uncovered (so they can't be mines). So (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nCell (1,0)=2. Its adjacent cells are: (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0) (unknown), (2,1) (unknown). So the 2 mines here must be in (2,0), (2,1), or (0,1) or (1,1). But (0,1) and (1,1) are uncovered, so they can't be mines. So (1,0)=2 has 2 mines in (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nCell (1,1)=3. Its adjacent cells are: (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,1)=1, (0,2) (unknown), (1,0)=2, (1,2) (unknown), (2,0) (unknown), (2,1) (unknown), (2,2) (unknown). So (1,1)=3 has 3 mines in its adjacent cells. Let's list them: (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). \n\nFrom (1,0)=2, we know (2,0) and (2,1) must be mines (since those are the only possible cells adjacent to (1,0) that could be mines). So (2,0) and (2,1) are mines. Let's note that. Then, (1,1)=3 has adjacent mines. The adjacent cells are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0) [mine], (2,1) [mine], (2,2). So (2,0) and (2,1) are 2 mines, so (1,1) needs 1 more mine in (0,2), (1,2), or (2,2).\n\nAlso, (0,1)=1 has adjacent cells (0,2), (1,2). Since (0,1) has 1 mine, and (1,1)=3 has 3 mines (with 2 already from (2,0) and (2,1)), the mine for (0,1) must be either (0,2) or (1,2). Let's say (0,2) is a mine: then (0,1) has 1 mine, which fits. Then (1,1) would have (2,0), (2,1), and (0,2) as mines, totaling 3, which fits. Then (1,2) would be safe. Alternatively, if (1,2) is the mine for (0,1), then (1,1) would have (2,0), (2,1), and (1,2) as mines, also 3, which fits. So both possibilities are there.\n\nBut let's check (2,0) and (2,1). If (1,0)=2, and its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). The first three are uncovered (so not mines), so the two mines must be (2,0) and (2,1). Therefore, those two cells are mines. So we should flag them. Wait, but the current flags are 0\/19 (probably a typo, since there are 10 mines, so Flags: 0\/10). So the user might have a typo there. But according to the problem, total mines are 10.\n\nSo, if (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, then we can flag them. Let's confirm. (1,0) is 2, which means exactly two mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, safe), (0,1) (1, safe), (1,1) (3, safe), (2,0) (unknown), (2,1) (unknown). So yes, (2,0) and (2,1) must be the two mines. So we can flag those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can uncover a safe cell. Let's see if there are any cells that are definitely safe. For example, (0,2) and (1,2) could be safe or mines, but let's check (2,2). If (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, then (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1)=3. (1,1) has adjacent mines: (2,0), (2,1), and one more. If the third mine is (0,2), then (2,2) is safe. If the third mine is (1,2), then (2,2) is safe. If the third mine is (2,2), then (1,1) would have (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) as mines, which is 3, which also works. So (2,2) could be a mine or not.\n\nBut let's think of the 0 cell. (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. We've already uncovered (0,1) and (1,0), (1,1). So maybe the next step is to look for other 0 cells, but there are none in the current board.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 0, column 0: 0. Since it's 0, all adjacent cells are safe, which they are (already uncovered). So no new info there.\n\nWhat about (0,1)=1. Its adjacent cells: (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,2)=?, (1,0)=2 (safe), (1,1)=3 (safe), (1,2)=?. So the 1 mine is in (0,2) or (1,2). So if we uncover (0,2) or (1,2), we can get more info. But if (0,2) is a mine, uncovering it would end the game. So maybe better to flag the known mines first.\n\nWait, (1,0)=2's adjacent cells: (2,0) and (2,1) must be mines. So we can flag those. Let's check the current board: those cells are currently '?'. So the action would be to flag (2,0) and (2,1).\n\nBut let's confirm again. (1,0) is 2. The adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, not mine), (0,1) (1, not mine), (1,1) (3, not mine), (2,0) (unknown), (2,1) (unknown), (2,0) and (2,1) are the only possible mines here. So exactly two mines, so those two must be mines. Therefore, flagging (2,0) and (2,1) is correct.\n\nSo the first action could be to flag (2,0). Let's output that.\n\nAnswer: flag (2,0)","flag (2,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current state of the board. The user provided a current board, but wait, the board is supposed to be 9x9, right? The given board has rows labeled 0 to 13, which might be a typo. Maybe it's a formatting error, and each row is actually 9 cells. Let's assume that each row is 9 columns, so row 0 has columns 0-8, row 1 0-8, etc.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Assuming 9 columns, so 0,1, then 7 ?)\nRow 1: 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: F ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 3-13: All ? (but probably rows 3-8 are the actual 9x9, maybe the user listed rows up to 13 by mistake)\n\nFirst, let's correct the board dimensions. The Minesweeper is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Let's parse the given board correctly. Maybe the user made a mistake in the number of rows listed. Let's focus on rows 0,1,2 as the first three rows of the 9x9 grid.\n\nRow 0 (row 0): columns 0 is 0, column 1 is 1, columns 2-8 are ?\nRow 1 (row 1): column 0 is 2, column 1 is 3, columns 2-8 are ?\nRow 2 (row 2): column 0 is F (flagged), columns 1-8 are ?\n\nNow, let's recall Minesweeper rules. The numbers indicate the count of mines in adjacent cells. Let's analyze the known numbers to find safe cells or mines.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0: it's 0. A 0 means none of the 8 adjacent cells have mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,0) is 0, so these three cells must be safe (no mines). Wait, (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) must have 0 mines. Let's list adjacent cells for (0,0):\n\nAdjacent cells are (0,1) (right), (1,0) (down), (1,1) (down-right). Since (0,0) is 0, all these cells have 0 mines. But (0,1) is already uncovered as 1. Wait, (0,1) is 1, which is a number. That means (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Let's check (0,1):\n\n(0,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n(0,0) - uncovered (0, safe)\n(0,2) - ? (unknown)\n(1,0) - 2 (uncovered)\n(1,1) - 3 (uncovered)\n(1,2) - ? (unknown)\nSo, the adjacent cells to (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). The count is 1, so among these, exactly 1 mine. But (0,0) is safe (0), (1,0) is 2 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe). So the mine must be in either (0,2) or (1,2). So (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nNow, row 1, column 0 is 2. Let's look at (1,0). Its adjacent cells are:\n(0,0) - 0 (safe)\n(0,1) - 1 (safe)\n(1,1) - 3 (safe)\n(2,0) - F (flagged, which is a mine candidate)\n(2,1) - ? (unknown)\nSo, (1,0) is 2, meaning 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Since (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are safe (uncovered, no mine), the mines must be in (2,0) and (2,1). But (2,0) is flagged (F). If the flag is correct, then (2,0) is a mine. So (1,0) is 2, so there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. If (2,0) is a mine (flagged), then the other mine must be in (2,1). So (2,1) should be a mine. But wait, let's confirm.\n\n(1,0) has 5 adjacent cells (since it's on the top-left edge, maybe only 5 adjacent cells? Wait, (1,0) is row 1, column 0. The adjacent cells are:\n\nUp: (0,0)\nUp-right: (0,1)\nRight: (1,1)\nDown: (2,0)\nDown-right: (2,1)\n\nYes, 5 cells. (1,0) is 2, so 2 mines in these 5. (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are uncovered (so safe, not mines). So the mines must be in (2,0) and (2,1). Since (2,0) is flagged (F), if that's a correct flag, then (2,1) must also be a mine. Alternatively, if the flag is incorrect, then maybe (2,0) is not a mine, and two mines are in (2,1) and another cell, but that's less likely.\n\nNow, row 1, column 1 is 3. Let's check (1,1). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,0) - 0 (safe)\n(0,1) - 1 (safe)\n(0,2) - ?\n(1,0) - 2 (safe)\n(1,2) - ?\n(2,0) - F (flagged)\n(2,1) - ?\n(2,2) - ?\n\nSo (1,1) is 3, meaning 3 mines in these 8 adjacent cells. Let's list the safe cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are safe (uncovered). So the remaining cells are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So 5 cells, and 3 mines among them.\n\nFrom (0,1) being 1: we know that (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which are (0,2), (1,2), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1). But (1,0), (0,0), (1,1) are safe, so (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2).\n\nFrom (1,0) being 2: 2 mines in (2,0) and (2,1). If (2,0) is a mine (flagged), then (2,1) is a mine. So that's 2 mines.\n\nNow, (1,1) is 3. Let's assume (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (2 mines). Then, (1,1) needs 1 more mine in (0,2), (1,2), (2,2).\n\nFrom (0,1) being 1: there's 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2). So if (0,2) is a mine, then (1,2) is safe, and (1,1) would have that mine plus (2,0), (2,1) = 3 mines, which fits. Alternatively, if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,2) is safe, and (1,1) would have that mine plus (2,0), (2,1) = 3 mines, which also fits.\n\nBut let's think about the 0 in (0,0). (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe (which they are, as they are uncovered numbers). So no mines there.\n\nNow, what cells can we safely uncover? Let's look for cells that must be safe.\n\nLet's consider (0,2). If (0,1) is 1, and (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1), (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2). Suppose we uncover (0,2). If (0,2) is a mine, then (0,1)'s count is satisfied. If it's not a mine, then (1,2) must be a mine. But how can we know?\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (2,0) which is flagged. The score is 0.0526, which is 1\/19 (since 1\/19 ≈ 0.0526). So the user has flagged 1 mine, and there are 10 total. The current flags are 1\/19, which might mean 1 flag in total, 19 cells flagged? Wait, the Score is correct flags \/ total mines (10). So 0.0526 is 1\/19.0, but 1\/10 is 0.1. So maybe the user has 1 correct flag out of 19 total flags (so 1 correct, 18 incorrect). That's a low score. So the flag at (2,0) might be incorrect.\n\nIf (2,0) is not a mine (since the flag is probably wrong, as the score is low), then (1,0) being 2 must have 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). Since (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are safe, then if (2,0) is not a mine, the two mines must be in (2,1). But (2,1) is only one cell, so that's impossible. Therefore, (2,0) must be a mine (correct flag), so the user's 1 correct flag is (2,0). Then (1,0) has 2 mines: (2,0) and (2,1). So (2,1) is a mine.\n\nThen (1,1) is 3. Its adjacent mines would be (2,0), (2,1), and one more. The remaining possible cells are (0,2), (1,2), (2,2). From (0,1) being 1, which has adjacent cells (0,2), (1,2), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1). Since (1,0), (0,0), (1,1) are safe, (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2). So (0,2) or (1,2) is a mine. Let's say (0,2) is the mine. Then (1,1) has (2,0), (2,1), (0,2) = 3 mines, which matches the 3. So that works. Alternatively, if (1,2) is the mine, then (1,1) has (2,0), (2,1), (1,2) = 3 mines, which also works.\n\nBut how to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that have 0 adjacent mines. For example, (0,0) is 0, which we already know. What about (0,1)? (0,1) is 1, so it has 1 mine around, but we don't know where. (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3.\n\nAnother approach: cells that are adjacent to 0s. Since (0,0) is 0, all adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe (already uncovered). The next cells adjacent to these might be safe. For example, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) (which is 1). (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (3) and (0,1) (1). (2,0) is flagged (mine), (2,1) is mine (as per (1,0)'s 2), (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (3).\n\nWait, maybe (0,2) is a good candidate to uncover. If (0,2) is safe, then (0,1)'s 1 mine must be in (1,2). If (0,2) is a mine, then (1,2) is safe. But how to know? Alternatively, let's see if there's a cell that must be safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is 0. The cell (0,0) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. But (0,0) is at the top-left corner, so adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). These are all uncovered, and they are numbers (1, 2, 3), which are safe (since numbers indicate no mine in the cell itself, only in adjacent). So the next cells to check would be adjacent to these numbers.\n\nFor example, (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) (which is 1). (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which are (0,2), (1,2), (1,0), (0,0), (1,1). Since (1,0), (0,0), (1,1) are safe, (0,1) has 1 mine in (0,2) or (1,2). So if we uncover (0,2), if it's a number, then (1,2) is a mine. If it's a mine, then (1,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, (1,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (3) and (0,1) (1). Let's think about (1,1) being 3. (1,1) has adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). We know (0,0), (0,1), (1,0) are safe. (2,0) is a mine (flagged), (2,1) is a mine (from (1,0)'s 2). So that's 2 mines. So (1,1) needs 1 more mine. That mine is either (0,2), (1,2), or (2,2).\n\nIf (0,2) is a mine, then (0,1)'s 1 mine is (0,2), so (1,2) is safe. Then (1,1)'s 3 mines are (2,0), (2,1), (0,2). That works. Then (1,2) is safe, so we can uncover (1,2).\n\nIf (1,2) is a mine, then (0,1)'s 1 mine is (1,2), so (0,2) is safe. Then (1,1)'s 3 mines are (2,0), (2,1), (1,2). That also works. Then (0,2) is safe, so we can uncover (0,2).\n\nAlternatively, (2,2) could be the third mine. Then (0,1)'s 1 mine is either (0,2) or (1,2). Let's say (2,2) is the mine. Then (1,1) has (2,0), (2,1), (2,2) = 3 mines. Then (0,1)'s 1 mine must be in (0,2) or (1,2). So (0,2) or (1,2) is a mine, the other is safe.\n\nBut how to determine which is safe. Maybe there's no sure thing, but we need to pick a cell that's likely safe. Let's look for cells that are not adjacent to many numbers. For example, cells in the top row, beyond column 2. (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1) (1) and (1,1) (3). (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) (unknown) and (1,2) (unknown) and (1,3) (unknown). Since (0,0) is 0, and (0,1) is 1, maybe (0,2) is a good first step.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the user has only 1 correct flag out of 19, which is very low. So the flagged cell (2,0) is probably incorrect. Wait, the score is correct flags \/ total mines (10). So 0.0526 is 1\/19.0, but 1\/10 is 0.1. So maybe the user has 1 correct flag and 18 incorrect flags (total flags 19). So (2,0) is a flag, but it's incorrect. That would mean (2,0) is not a mine. Then, (1,0) is 2, which has adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). If (2,0) is not a mine, then the two mines must be in (2,1). But (2,1) is a single cell, so that's impossible. Therefore, the flag at (2,0) must be correct (1 correct flag), and the other 18 flags are incorrect (but the board shows only row 2 has an F, so maybe the user has flagged 19 cells, but the board display only shows some). This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board display is abbreviated. Let's focus on the visible F at (2,0). If (2,0) is a mine (correct flag), then (1,0) is 2, so (2,1) must be a mine. Then (1,1) is 3, so there's another mine in (0,2), (1,2), or (2,2). Let's assume (0,2) is a mine. Then (0,1) is 1, which is satisfied. So (0,2) is a mine, (1,2) is safe. So (1,2) can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,2) is safe. So (0,2) can be uncovered.\n\nSince we need to choose a cell to uncover, let's pick (0,2) or (1,2). Let's see which is more likely. Let's look at (0,2): adjacent to (0,1) (1) and (1,1) (3). If (0,2) is safe, then (0,1)'s mine is (1,2), and (1,1)'s third mine is (1,2) or (2,2). If (0,2) is a mine, then (1,2) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 0, column 0 is 0, which means (0,0) has no adjacent mines. The cell (0,0) is (row 0, column 0). The cell (0,1) is 1, which is safe (no mine in (0,1) itself). The cell (1,0) is 2, safe. (1,1) is 3, safe.\n\nAnother angle: in Minesweeper, when you have a 1 next to a 2, there might be a pattern. But maybe it's better to pick a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Since (0,0) is 0, and its adjacent cells are all uncovered, the next layer is (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (2,0) is flagged, (2,1) is a mine (if (2,0) is correct). So (0,2) and (1,2) are candidates.\n\nLet's pick (0,2) to uncover. So the action would be 'uncover (0,2)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,2)","uncover (0,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a partial board, but wait, the board is supposed to be 9x9, but the current board shown has 13 rows? Maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the rows are listed with each row's cells separated by spaces. Let's parse the current board correctly.\n\nThe current board is displayed as rows, each row's cells are separated by spaces. Let's list them properly. The first row is \"0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" — wait, that's 13 cells, but a 9x9 grid should have 9 cells per row. Maybe that's a typo, and it's supposed to be 9 cells. Let's assume each row has 9 cells. Let's correct that:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? (assuming the first three are 0,1,1, then six ?)\nRow 1: 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: F ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 3-8: All ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nSo rows 0-2 are partially revealed, rows 3-8 are all unknown.\n\nFirst, let's recall Minesweeper rules. The numbers indicate the count of adjacent mines. The 'F' is a flagged cell, which the player thinks is a mine. The score is correct flags (1) out of 10 total mines, and there are 19 flags placed (since Flags: 1\/19, meaning 19 flags placed, 1 correct). So the player has flagged 19 cells, but only 1 is a mine. That's a lot of incorrect flags.\n\nThe win condition is to correctly flag all mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or uncovering a mine. The goal is to maximize the score, which is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nNow, let's look at the revealed cells to find safe moves.\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [2, 3, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\n\nLet's start with row 0, column 0: 0. A 0 means none of the 8 adjacent cells have mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Let's check:\n\n(0,0) is 0. So (0,1) (which is 1 in row 0), (1,0) (which is 2 in row 1), and (1,1) (which is 3 in row 1) — all these cells are already uncovered, so that's consistent. The 0's adjacent cells are already safe.\n\nRow 0, column 1: 1. This cell has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,2) is 1 (uncovered), (1,0) is 2 (uncovered), (1,1) is 3 (uncovered), (1,2) is ? (unknown). So the 1 at (0,1) must have exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (1,2). Let's see: (0,1) is 1. The known adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) are all safe (since they are uncovered, so no mine there). So the only possible adjacent cell with a mine is (1,2). Therefore, (1,2) must be a mine? Wait, let's confirm.\n\nWait, (0,1) is 1. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,0) - safe (uncovered, 0)\n(0,2) - uncovered (value 1, which is a number, so safe)\n(1,0) - uncovered (value 2, safe)\n(1,1) - uncovered (value 3, safe)\n(1,2) - unknown\n(0,1) has 8 adjacent cells, but since it's on the top edge, the adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), but row can't be -1. So (0,1) adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). So 5 cells. The 1 at (0,1) means exactly 1 of these 5 has a mine. But (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) are all uncovered (so they are safe, no mine). So the only possible mine is (1,2). Therefore, (1,2) must be a mine. So we should flag (1,2).\n\nBut wait, let's check row 0, column 2: 1. Let's look at (0,2). Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe), (0,2) is 1. So adjacent cells: (0,1) (safe), (0,3) (unknown), (1,1) (safe), (1,2) (unknown), (1,3) (unknown). The 1 at (0,2) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. From (0,1) we deduced (1,2) is a mine. So if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,2) has that mine as adjacent. So (0,2) is 1, which would mean that's the only mine. So (0,3), (1,3) must be safe.\n\nNow row 1, column 0: 2. Let's check (1,0). Its adjacent cells are (0,0) (safe), (0,1) (safe), (1,1) (safe), (2,0) (F, flagged), (2,1) (unknown). So (1,0) is 2, which means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are safe (uncovered), so the mines must be in (2,0) and (2,1). But (2,0) is flagged (F). So if (2,0) is a mine (since it's flagged), then (2,1) must also be a mine to make the count 2. Because (1,0) is 2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. (2,0) is flagged (so assumed mine), so (2,1) must be a mine as well.\n\nRow 1, column 1: 3. Let's check (1,1). Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Let's list them:\n\n(0,0): safe\n(0,1): safe\n(0,2): safe\n(1,0): safe (value 2)\n(1,2): unknown (we think mine)\n(2,0): F (flagged, assumed mine)\n(2,1): unknown (we think mine)\n(2,2): unknown\n\n(1,1) is 3, so 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's count possible mines here. From (1,0) we have (2,0) and (2,1) as mines (2 mines). From (0,1) we have (1,2) as a mine (1 mine). That's 3 mines. So (2,0), (2,1), (1,2) are mines. That would make (1,1) have 3 mines adjacent, which matches its value. So that's consistent.\n\nSo (1,2) is a mine (from (0,1)), (2,0) is a mine (flagged, which is correct), (2,1) is a mine (needs to be flagged), and (1,2) is a mine (needs to be flagged). Let's confirm:\n\n(1,0) is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,0) (mine) and (2,1) (mine) → 2 mines, correct.\n\n(0,1) is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,2) (mine) → 1 mine, correct.\n\n(1,1) is 3. Adjacent mines: (2,0), (2,1), (1,2) → 3 mines, correct.\n\nSo these deductions are consistent.\n\nNow, let's check (0,2) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,1) (safe), (0,3) (unknown), (1,1) (safe), (1,2) (mine), (1,3) (unknown). So (0,2) has 1 mine (which is (1,2)), so (0,3) and (1,3) must be safe (since 1 mine already accounted for). Therefore, (0,3) and (1,3) can be safely uncovered.\n\nSimilarly, (0,3) is unknown. Since (0,2) is 1 and (1,2) is a mine, (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) (which is 1), (0,4) (unknown), (1,2) (mine), (1,3) (unknown), (1,4) (unknown). But since (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) (1), and (1,2) is a mine, (0,3)'s adjacent mine count from (1,2) is 1. If (0,3) is uncovered, what's its value? Let's see, but maybe we can just uncover (0,3) as it's safe.\n\nSo the safest move is to uncover a cell that's definitely safe. Let's see which cells are safe.\n\nFrom (0,2) being 1 and (1,2) being a mine, (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2) and (1,2). Since (0,2) is 1, and (1,2) is a mine, the 1 at (0,2) is already accounted for by (1,2), so (0,3) must be safe. So (0,3) can be uncovered.\n\nAnother safe cell: (1,3). Because (0,2) is 1, and (1,2) is a mine, (1,3) is adjacent to (0,2) (1) and (1,2) (mine). The 1 at (0,2) is already from (1,2), so (1,3) is safe.\n\nAlso, (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1) (3). (1,1) has 3 mines: (2,0), (2,1), (1,2). So (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1) but those 3 mines are already counted, so (2,2) is safe? Let's check (1,1) adjacent cells: (2,2) is adjacent. So (1,1) has 3 mines, which are (2,0), (2,1), (1,2). So (2,2) is not a mine. So (2,2) is safe.\n\nSo possible safe cells to uncover: (0,3), (1,3), (2,2), etc.\n\nThe player has a lot of incorrect flags (19 flags, only 1 correct). So maybe unflagging some, but the problem is the user hasn't provided the positions of the flags except row 2, column 0 (since row 2 is \"F ? ? ...\", so (2,0) is flagged). The Flags count is 1\/19, so 19 flags in total. So there are 18 other flagged cells that are incorrect. But the current board display only shows (2,0) as F. The rest of the F's are in other cells not shown (since the board display may be truncated). But without knowing where the other flags are, it's hard to unflag them. The user's action could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nThe best move here is to uncover a cell that's definitely safe. Let's pick (0,3). Let's check coordinates: rows are 0-8, columns 0-8. (0,3) is in row 0, column 3. That's within the 9x9 grid.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (0,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,3)","uncover (0,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to look at the current board and the game state. The board provided is a bit confusing because it's written as a list of rows, but Minesweeper is typically 9x9. Wait, maybe the user made a formatting mistake. Let me check again. Oh, the Current Board section has rows that start with 0, 1, 2, etc., but there are more than 9 rows listed. That might be a typo, but maybe it's just a display error. Let's assume the board is 9x9, so maybe the rows are 0-8, and the columns 0-8.\n\nThe user's input format examples use (row, col), so coordinates are (row, col) with (0,0) top-left. The current board has some cells uncovered, some flagged, and some unknown (marked as ?). Let's parse the current board row by row, assuming each row is a line. Let's list out the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, the original says \"0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" but that's 13 elements. Maybe it's a formatting error. Maybe each row should have 9 columns. Let's correct that. Maybe each row is 9 cells. So row 0: 0,1,1,2,?,?,?,?,? (columns 0-8). Then row 1: 2,3,?,?,?,?,?,?,? (columns 0-8). Row 2: F,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,? (column 0 is F, others ?). Rows 3-8: all ? in all columns.\n\nSo let's map the current known cells:\n\nRow 0:\n(0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (0,6)=?, (0,7)=?, (0,8)=?\n\nRow 1:\n(1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (1,6)=?, (1,7)=?, (1,8)=?\n\nRow 2:\n(2,0)=F (flagged), (2,1)=?, (2,2)=?, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (2,6)=?, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?\n\nRows 3-8: all cells are ?\n\nNow, the game has 10 mines total. The user has flagged 1 mine (Flags: 1\/19, which might be a typo, maybe 1\/10? Because total mines are 10). The score is 0.0526, which is 1\/19, but that's probably a mistake. Let's focus on the board.\n\nLet's analyze the known numbers. Starting with (0,0)=0. A 0 means none of the adjacent cells have mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,0) is 0, so these adjacent cells must have 0 mines. Wait, (0,1) is 1, which is the count of adjacent mines. So (0,1)=1: the number of mines in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells for each number.\n\n(0,0)=0: adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, none of these adjacent cells are mines. But (0,1) is 1, which is the count of mines around it. So (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is 0 (not a mine), (1,0) is 2 (not a mine), (1,1) is 3 (not a mine). So the adjacent cells of (0,1) are (0,2), (1,2). So (0,1)=1 implies that exactly one of (0,2) or (1,2) is a mine.\n\n(0,2)=1: Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,2) is at (row 0, col 2). Adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=1 (not a mine), (1,1)=3 (not a mine), (0,3)=2 (not a mine). So (0,2)=1's adjacent mines are in (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). Wait, (0,3) is 2, which is a number, so not a mine. So (0,2)=1's adjacent mines must be in (1,2) and (1,3). Since (0,2)=1, exactly one of those two is a mine.\n\n(0,3)=2: Adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2)=1 (not mine), (1,2)=? (unknown), (1,3)=? (unknown), (1,4)=? (unknown), (0,4)=? (unknown). So (0,3)=2 means there are 2 mines in those adjacent cells.\n\nRow 1, (1,0)=2: Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0)=0 (not mine), (0,1)=1 (not mine), (1,1)=3 (not mine), (2,0)=F (flagged, which is a mine candidate). So (1,0)=2: the count of mines in its adjacent cells is 2. The adjacent cells are (2,0) and (2,1). Because (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are not mines. So (1,0)=2 implies that there are 2 mines in (2,0) and (2,1). But (2,0) is flagged (F). If the flag is correct, then (2,0) is a mine. So then (2,1) must also be a mine to make the total 2. Because 2 mines in (2,0) and (2,1). So (1,0)=2 → (2,0) and (2,1) are both mines. But (2,0) is already flagged. So if that's correct, (2,1) should be a mine, so we should flag (2,1). But wait, the user has only flagged 1 mine. If (2,0) is a correct flag, then (2,1) is also a mine. Let's check (1,1)=3.\n\n(1,1)=3: Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0)=0 (no mine), (0,1)=1 (no mine), (0,2)=1 (no mine), (1,0)=2 (no mine). So the adjacent mines are in (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (1,1)=3 means there are 3 mines here. We already think (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (from (1,0)=2). So that's 2 mines. So (1,2) or (2,2) must have 1 more mine. So (1,2) + (2,2) = 1 mine.\n\nGoing back to (0,1)=1: adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). We know (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) are not mines. (0,2)=1 (not mine). So the only possible mine is (1,2). (0,1)=1 → (1,2) is a mine. Because that's the only adjacent cell left. So (1,2) is a mine. Then, from (1,1)=3: (2,0), (2,1), (1,2) are 3 mines, so (2,2) must be safe (since 3 mines already). So (2,2) is safe.\n\nNow, (0,2)=1: adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=1 (no mine), (1,1)=3 (no mine), (1,2)=mine (so that's 1 mine). So (0,2)=1 is satisfied because there's 1 mine in (1,2). Then (0,3)=2: adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2)=1 (no mine), (1,2)=mine (so 1 mine so far). So (0,3)=2 needs 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nLet's summarize what we have so far:\n\nMines identified (from logic):\n- (2,0) (flagged)\n- (2,1) (must be mine, from (1,0)=2)\n- (1,2) (must be mine, from (0,1)=1)\n\nPossible safe cells:\n- (2,2) (from (1,1)=3)\n\nSo (2,2) is safe, so we can uncover (2,2). That's a good move because it's safe. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nIf (2,2) is uncovered, since it's safe, it will show the number of adjacent mines. Let's see the adjacent cells of (2,2): (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). We know (1,2) is a mine, (2,1) is a mine. So that's 2 mines. So (2,2) should show 2. But regardless, uncovering a safe cell is good.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other cells. The cell (2,2) is in row 2, column 2. Let's confirm the logic again. (1,1)=3 has adjacent cells including (2,0), (2,1), (1,2), (2,2). We have (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=mine, (1,2)=mine. That's 3 mines, so (2,2) must be safe. So uncovering (2,2) is safe. That's a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,2)","uncover (2,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a typo. The user probably meant 9 rows, but the current board is shown with 13 rows. Maybe that's a formatting error. Let's focus on the given information.\n\nThe score is 0.0526, which is 1\/19, so they've flagged 1 mine correctly out of 10 total. The current board has some numbers and question marks. Let's parse the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, 9 columns? The first row has 13 elements, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake. Let's assume each row is 9 columns, and the user might have split it into lines. Let's correct that. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the lines are split for display. Let's try to reconstruct:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 columns)\nRow 1: 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: F ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 3-8: all ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nSo the visible cells are in rows 0,1,2. Let's list the known cells:\n\n(0,0): 0 (no adjacent mines)\n(0,1): 1 (1 adjacent mine)\n(0,2): 1 (1 adjacent mine)\n(0,3): 2 (2 adjacent mines)\n(1,0): 2 (2 adjacent mines)\n(1,1): 3 (3 adjacent mines)\n(2,0): F (flagged)\n(2,2): 2 (2 adjacent mines)\n\nNow, let's analyze the 0 at (0,0). A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells have no mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Wait, (0,0) is top-left, so adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3. Wait, that's conflicting. Because a 0 in (0,0) should mean that none of its adjacent cells are mines. But (0,1) is a 1, which counts the adjacent mines. So (0,1) is a safe cell (since it's uncovered), and its value is 1, meaning it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is 0 (safe), so (0,1)'s 1 must come from one of (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\n(0,2) is 1. Let's check (0,2)'s adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is safe, so (0,2)'s 1 comes from one of (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\n(1,0) is 2. Adjacent cells to (1,0) are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) and (0,1) are safe, (2,0) is flagged (F). So (1,0) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. If (2,0) is a mine (since it's flagged), then (1,0)'s 2 would mean that there's 1 more mine in (1,1), (2,1). Because (1,0) has adjacent cells: (0,0) (safe), (0,1) (safe), (1,1) (unknown), (2,0) (flagged as mine), (2,1) (unknown). So 2 mines: if (2,0) is a mine, then (1,1) or (2,1) must be a mine. But (1,1) is 3. Let's check (1,1)'s adjacent cells. (1,1) is 3, so it has 3 mines around. Adjacent cells: (0,0) (safe), (0,1) (safe), (0,2) (safe), (1,0) (safe), (1,2) (unknown), (2,0) (F), (2,1) (unknown), (2,2) (safe, value 2). So (1,1) has 3 mines in (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). But (2,2) is 2, which is a safe cell (uncovered), so (2,2) is not a mine. (2,0) is F, so if that's a mine, then (1,1) has 3 mines: (2,0) plus two more from (1,2) and (2,1). \n\n(2,2) is 2. Let's look at (2,2)'s adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is 3 (safe), (2,2) is 2, so the 2 mines are in the adjacent cells. \n\nLet's try to find safe cells to uncover. The 0 at (0,0) means all adjacent cells are safe. Wait, no: the 0 is a cell that has been uncovered, and its value is 0, meaning none of its 8 adjacent cells are mines. So the adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) is 1, which is an uncovered cell (so safe), (1,0) is 2 (uncovered, safe), (1,1) is 3 (uncovered, safe). So that's correct: (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe, which they are (they are uncovered, not mines). \n\nNow, (0,0) is 0, so any cell adjacent to (0,0) that is unknown can be uncovered safely. Wait, no: (0,0) is 0, so its adjacent cells are safe. But (0,0) is at (0,0), adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all already uncovered. So no help there.\n\nLooking at (0,3) which is a '?'. (0,3) is in row 0, column 3. Let's check the adjacent cells of (0,3). The cell (0,3) is currently unknown. Its adjacent cells are (0,2) (value 1), (0,4) (unknown), (1,2) (unknown), (1,3) (unknown), (1,4) (unknown). The cell (0,2) is 1, which has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (0,2)'s adjacent cells are (0,1) (1, safe), (0,3) (unknown), (1,1) (3, safe), (1,2) (unknown), (1,3) (unknown). So (0,2) has 1 mine in (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). \n\nThe cell (1,0) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, safe), (0,1) (1, safe), (1,1) (3, safe), (2,0) (F), (2,1) (unknown). So (1,0) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. If (2,0) is a mine (since it's flagged), then there's 1 more mine in (1,1) or (2,1). But (1,1) is 3, which is an uncovered cell (safe), so (1,1) can't be a mine. So (2,1) must be a mine. Wait, (1,1) is 3, which is a number, so it's a safe cell (not a mine). So (1,0) has adjacent cells: (2,0) (F) and (2,1) (unknown). If (2,0) is a mine, then (2,1) must be the second mine to make (1,0)'s value 2. So (2,1) is a mine. Therefore, (2,1) should be flagged. But maybe that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a cell has a number that equals the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (2,2) which is 2. Its adjacent cells are (1,1) (3), (1,2) (unknown), (1,3) (unknown), (2,1) (unknown), (2,3) (unknown), (3,1) (unknown), (3,2) (unknown), (3,3) (unknown). There are no flags adjacent to (2,2), so 2 mines are there. Not helpful.\n\nLooking at (1,1) which is 3. Its adjacent cells: (0,0) (0), (0,1) (1), (0,2) (1), (1,0) (2), (1,2) (unknown), (2,0) (F), (2,1) (unknown), (2,2) (2). So (1,1) has 3 mines in (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (2,2) is 2 (safe), so (2,2) is not a mine. (2,0) is F (flagged as mine). So if (2,0) is a mine, then (1,2) and (2,1) must be mines to reach 3. Because 1 (from 2,0) + 2 (from 1,2 and 2,1) = 3. So (1,2) and (2,1) are mines. Then, (0,2) is 1. (0,2)'s adjacent mines are (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). If (1,2) is a mine (from above), then (0,2)'s 1 is satisfied by (1,2). So (0,3) and (1,3) are safe. Therefore, (0,3) is safe and can be uncovered. That's a good candidate.\n\nLet me verify: (0,2) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,1) (safe), (0,3) (unknown), (1,1) (safe), (1,2) (mine), (1,3) (unknown). So if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,2) has exactly 1 mine (from (1,2)), so (0,3) and (1,3) are safe. Therefore, (0,3) is safe. So uncovering (0,3) is safe.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the best move is to uncover (0,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a board that's 9x9, but the way it's displayed here might be a bit confusing. Wait, the initial message says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 13 rows? Maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board. Let's assume the board is 9x9, with rows 0 to 8 and columns 0 to 8.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the visible cells. The first row (row 0) is: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 columns). Wait, the initial input shows row 0 as \"0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which is 13 entries, which can't be right. Maybe it's a typo. Let's focus on the valid parts. Let's take the first few rows as given, perhaps the user intended to show a 9x9 grid but the formatting is off. Let's list the known cells:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-3 are 0, 1, 1, 2; columns 4-8 are ?\nRow 1: columns 0-2 are 2, 3, ?; columns 3-8 are ?\nRow 2: column 0 is F (flagged), column 2 is 2; others are ?\nRows 3-8: all ?\n\nFirst, let's recall that the board has 10 mines. The user has flagged 1 mine (as per \"Flags: 1\/19\" – maybe that's 1 flagged out of 19 possible? Not sure, but the score is 0.0526 which is 1\/19, so maybe 1 correct flag out of 19 flagged? But the total mines are 10, so the correct flags are 1, and total flagged is 19? That seems odd. Anyway, the key is to find safe cells to uncover or correctly flag mines.\n\nLet's analyze the known cells. Let's start with row 0, column 0: value 0. A 0 means none of the adjacent cells have mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, those cells must be safe (no mines). Let's check row 0, column 1: value 1. The adjacent cells to (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). We know (0,0) is 0 (safe), (1,0) is 2 (row 1, column 0 is 2), (1,1) is 3 (row 1, column 1 is 3). The value 1 at (0,1) means there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells. Since (0,0) is safe, the mine must be in one of (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). But (1,0) is 2, which is a number, so it's a safe cell (already uncovered). (1,1) is 3, also a safe cell. So (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent, which are (0,2) and (1,2). Because (0,0) is 0, (1,0) and (1,1) are uncovered (so safe), so (0,2) and (1,2) are adjacent to (0,1). So (0,1)=1 implies one of those two is a mine.\n\nRow 0, column 2 is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe). So the adjacent cells are (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). The value 1 at (0,2) means 1 mine in those three.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 1 (safe), so the mines are in (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The value 2 here means 2 mines in those four.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe). (2,0) is F (flagged). So the adjacent cells are (2,0) (flagged), (2,1). The value 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. Since (2,0) is flagged (assuming it's a mine), then (2,1) must be a mine to make the total 2. Because 2 mines: (2,0) and (2,1). So if (2,0) is a correct flag (mine), then (2,1) must be a mine. But wait, the user has 1 correct flag, so maybe (2,0) is a correct flag. Let's assume that (2,0) is a mine (since it's flagged and the score is 1\/10, maybe that's the only correct flag). Then, row 1, column 0 (value 2) has adjacent mines: (2,0) and (2,1). So (2,1) must be a mine. So (2,1) should be flagged.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 3. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,1) is 1 (safe), (0,2) is 1 (safe), (1,0) is 2 (safe), (2,0) is F (mine), (2,1) is mine (from above). So the adjacent cells that could have mines are (0,3), (1,2), (2,2). Wait, (0,3) is (0,3), which is in row 0, column 3 (value 2). Let's list the adjacent cells for (1,1):\n\n- (0,0): 0 (safe)\n- (0,1): 1 (safe)\n- (0,2): 1 (safe)\n- (1,0): 2 (safe)\n- (1,2): ? (unknown)\n- (2,0): F (mine)\n- (2,1): mine (from row 1, column 0's 2)\n- (2,2): 2 (row 2, column 2 is 2)\n\nSo (1,1) has value 3, which is the count of adjacent mines. So far, we have (2,0) and (2,1) as mines (2 mines). So we need 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The remaining adjacent cells are (1,2) and (2,2). (2,2) is 2, which is a number (so it's a safe cell, already uncovered). So (2,2) is safe. Therefore, the third mine must be in (1,2). So (1,2) is a mine. That makes sense.\n\nSo (1,2) is a mine. Let's check row 0, column 2 (value 1). Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe), (1,2) is mine (so that's 1 mine). So the value 1 at (0,2) is satisfied, because there's 1 mine in (1,2). So that checks out.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 1 (safe), (1,2) is mine (1 mine). So we need 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4). So 2 total mines here.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is a mine (as we deduced). Let's check row 2, column 2 which is 2. The value 2 at (2,2) means there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is 3 (safe), (1,2) is mine (1), (2,1) is mine (2). So that's 2 mines. So (2,2) being 2 is correct, as it has 2 adjacent mines: (1,2) and (2,1). That matches, so that's a good consistency check.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The 0 in (0,0) means all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Those are all uncovered and have numbers, so no new info there.\n\nLooking for cells that are adjacent to 0s. Since (0,0) is 0, the cells around it are safe, but they're already uncovered. What about other 0s? The board doesn't show any other 0s. Let's check (row 0, column 0) is 0, so maybe expanding from there.\n\nAnother approach: cells that are adjacent to numbers and have known mine counts. For example, (row 0, column 4) is unknown. Let's see if we can determine if it's safe.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,4)=?, (1,2)=mine (1), (1,3)=?, (1,4)=?. So the 2 at (0,3) has 1 mine already (from (1,2)), so there's 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nRow 1, column 3 is unknown. Let's see if there are other numbers that can help. Row 1, column 0 is 2, which we've deduced has (2,0) and (2,1) as mines. Row 1, column 1 is 3, which has (2,0), (2,1), and (1,2) as mines. That's 3 mines, which matches the 3 value. Good.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is flagged (F). If that's a correct mine, then we have 1 correct flag. The total mines are 10, so we need to find 9 more.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that must be safe. For example, (row 3, column 0) is unknown. Let's check if it's adjacent to any numbers. The nearest number is row 2, column 0 (F) and row 2, column 2 (2). The cell (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0) (F) and (2,1) (mine), and (3,1), (1,0) (2). But (1,0) is 2, which is a number, so (1,0) is safe. The cell (3,0) is in row 3, column 0. Its adjacent cells are (2,0) (F), (2,1) (mine), (3,1) (unknown), (4,0) (unknown). Since (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, but (3,0) itself is unknown. There's no number adjacent to (3,0) that would indicate it's a mine, so maybe it's safe. But maybe we can find a better cell.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 4. Let's see if there's a way to determine if it's safe. From row 0, column 3 (value 2), which has 1 mine in (1,2) and needs 1 more in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4). If we can find another number that affects these cells. Let's check row 1, column 2 is a mine. What about row 1, column 3? Let's see if there are any numbers adjacent to (1,3). The adjacent cells to (1,3) would be (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=mine, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. So (1,3) is adjacent to (0,3)=2, (1,2)=mine, (2,2)=2. The (2,2)=2 has adjacent mines (1,2) and (2,1), which we already accounted for, so (2,3) is unknown. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 must be safe, but the only 0 is (0,0), and its adjacent cells are already uncovered. What about cells with a number that has all adjacent mines accounted for? For example, row 2, column 2 is 2, and we've determined its adjacent mines are (1,2) and (2,1). So any cells adjacent to (2,2) that are not mines should be safe. The adjacent cells to (2,2) are (1,1)=3 (safe), (1,2)=mine, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=mine, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=?. Since (2,2) has 2 mines, the remaining adjacent cells (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are safe. So (1,3) is safe. That's a good lead! Because (2,2)=2, and we've found both of its adjacent mines, so (1,3) must be safe. So we can uncover (1,3).\n\nLet me confirm that. (2,2) has value 2, which means exactly 2 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. We identified (1,2) and (2,1) as mines. That's 2 mines. So the other adjacent cells (1,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) must be safe (no mines). (1,1) is already uncovered (value 3), so it's safe. Therefore, (1,3) is safe and can be uncovered. That's a good move.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (1,3). Let's check the coordinates. Rows are 0-based, columns 0-based. (1,3) is row 1, column 3. That's an unknown cell (marked as ?), so uncovering it is a valid action.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,3)","uncover (1,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0 to 13? Wait, maybe that's a typo, but probably the user just pasted the current board as shown. The current board has some numbers, flags, and question marks (unknown cells). The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines correctly.\n\nThe score is 0.0526, which is 1\/19, so there's 1 correct flag out of 19 flagged (but total mines are 10). So maybe the user has flagged 19 cells, but only 1 is a mine. That's bad. The unflags are 0, so they haven't unflagged any.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Assuming columns 0-12, but maybe it's 0-8, perhaps a formatting issue. Let's assume each row is 9 columns, maybe the display is cut off. Let's parse row 0 as columns 0-8: 0,1,1,2,?,?,... up to column 8.)\n\nRow 1: 2 3 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? (columns 0-8: 2,3,?,2,?,?,...)\n\nRow 2: F ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? (column 0 is F (flagged), column 1 is ?, column 2 is 2, etc.)\n\nRows 3-13 are all ?.\n\nFirst, let's focus on the known cells. Let's list the known cells with their coordinates and values.\n\nRow 0, column 0: 0 (no adjacent mines). So all 8 adjacent cells (but (0,0) is top-left, so adjacent are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) must be safe. Since (0,0) is 0, those cells can't be mines. Let's check if those cells are uncovered. (0,1) is 1, (0,2) is 1, (1,0) is 2. So (0,1) is uncovered, value 1. The 0 at (0,0) tells us that (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe (no mines), which they are (since they are uncovered and not mines).\n\nRow 0, column 1: 1. This means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (0,1) are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,2) is 1 (safe), (1,0) is 2 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe). So the mine must be in (1,2). Because (0,1) has 1 mine, and all adjacent except (1,2) are uncovered and safe. So (1,2) is a mine.\n\nRow 0, column 2: 1. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe), (1,2) we think is a mine (from previous), so (0,2) has 1 mine, which is (1,2). That checks out.\n\nRow 0, column 3: 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2) is 1 (safe), (1,2) is a mine (as above), so the other mine must be in (1,3) or (1,4) or (0,4). Let's check row 1, column 0: 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,1) is 1 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe), (2,0) is F (flagged). So row 1, column 0 has value 2, which means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0) (safe), (0,1) (safe), (1,1) (safe), (2,0) (flagged), (2,1) (unknown). So 2 mines here. If (2,0) is a mine (since it's flagged), then (2,1) must also be a mine to make 2. Because 2 mines needed. So (2,0) is F, which the user flagged. If that's a correct flag, then (2,1) must be a mine. But the user's score is 1\/19, so maybe (2,0) is not a mine. Wait, the score is correct flags \/ total mines (10). So 1 correct flag, 19 total flags. So (2,0) is probably a wrong flag. Because if (2,0) were correct, then 1 correct flag, but 19 flags total, which matches 1\/19. So (2,0) is a flagged cell, but maybe it's not a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 1: 3. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0) safe, (0,1) safe, (0,2) safe, (1,0) is 2 (safe), (1,2) is a mine (from row 0, col1's 1), (2,0) is F (flagged), (2,2) is 2 (uncovered). So 3 mines needed here. We have (1,2) as a mine. If (2,0) is a mine (flagged), then we need 1 more mine in (2,1). So (2,1) would be a mine. Then (1,1) would have 3 mines: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1). That adds up.\n\nRow 2, column 2: 2. Adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1) is 3 (safe), (1,2) is a mine (as before), (2,1) is unknown (if it's a mine, from row 1, col1's 3), (2,3) is unknown. So if (1,2) and (2,1) are mines, then (2,2) has 2 mines, which matches. That works.\n\nRow 1, column 3: 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2) is 1 (safe), (0,3) is 2 (safe), (1,2) is a mine, (2,2) is 2 (safe). So 2 mines here. We have 1 mine (1,2), so another mine in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells. The 0 in (0,0) tells us that (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe, which they are. Any other 0s? No. The 0 in (0,0) might have adjacent cells already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells (but in corner, only 3) are safe. They are all uncovered. So no new info there.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 1 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,0) (0), (0,2) (1), (1,0) (2), (1,1) (3), (1,2) (unknown). Since (0,1) has 1 mine, and the other adjacent cells are uncovered (safe), (1,2) must be a mine. So (1,2) is a mine. That's a safe conclusion. So we should flag (1,2). But the user's current action is to choose between uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nWait, but the user's current board shows row 1 as \"2 3 ? 2 ? ? ? ? ?\", so row 1, column 2 is \"?\". So (1,2) is unknown. So according to the logic, (1,2) is a mine. So we should flag (1,2). But let's confirm.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (value 1) has adjacent cells: (0,0) (0, safe), (0,2) (1, safe), (1,0) (2, safe), (1,1) (3, safe), (1,2) (unknown). So the only possible mine is (1,2). So (1,2) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (1,2).\n\nBut wait, the user's score is 1\/19, meaning they have 19 flags, only 1 correct. So maybe they have a lot of incorrect flags. But (1,2) is a mine, so flagging it would increase the correct flags to 2, but the total flags would be 20, so score 2\/10 = 0.2 if 2 correct, but the current score is 1\/19. Maybe the user hasn't flagged (1,2) yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can uncover a safe cell. Let's look for cells that must be safe.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 4 is \"?\". Let's see if we can determine if it's safe.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2) (1, safe), (0,4) (unknown), (1,2) (mine), (1,3) (unknown), (1,4) (unknown). So (0,3) has 2 mines. We know (1,2) is a mine, so there's 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,3), (1,4).\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2) (1, safe), (0,3) (2, safe), (0,4) (unknown), (1,2) (mine), (1,4) (unknown), (2,2) (2, safe), (2,3) (unknown), (2,4) (unknown). So (1,3) has 2 mines. We know (1,2) is a mine, so 1 more mine here.\n\nIf (0,4) were a mine, then (0,3) would have (1,2) and (0,4) as mines (total 2), which matches. Then (1,3) would have (1,2) as a mine, so the other mine could be (1,4), (2,3), or (2,4). But we can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 0: F (flagged). The user flagged it, but since the score is 1\/19, maybe this is a wrong flag. So unflagging (2,0) would be good. But the user hasn't unflagged any yet. But the problem is, how do we know if (2,0) is a mine?\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0) (0, safe), (0,1) (1, safe), (1,1) (3, safe), (2,0) (F), (2,1) (unknown). So (1,0) has 2 mines. If (2,0) is a mine, then (2,1) must also be a mine (since 2 mines needed). If (2,0) is not a mine, then (2,1) must be 2 mines. But (2,0) is flagged, so if it's not a mine, unflagging it would be correct.\n\nBut let's get back to safe cells. Let's check row 3, column 0. All rows 3-13 are ?. But the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So maybe the display is showing more rows due to formatting. Let's assume rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is F (0,0). Row 2, column 1 is ?. Row 2, column 2 is 2.\n\nAnother approach: cells with 0 are safe, and their adjacent cells can be uncovered. But there's only (0,0) as 0, and its adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nWhat about a cell that's adjacent to a 1 and has only one unknown cell? Like (0,1) is 1, and we determined (1,2) is a mine, so (1,2) should be flagged.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 3, column 0: if we can find a reason it's safe. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the 0 in (0,0) has all adjacent cells uncovered, so no help. The 1 in (0,1) tells us (1,2) is a mine. So we should flag (1,2).\n\nBut the user's action options are uncover, flag, unflag. Since (1,2) is a mine, flagging it would be correct. So the action should be 'flag (1,2)'.\n\nWait, let's confirm coordinates. The top-left is (0,0). So row 0, column 0 is (0,0). Row 1 is the second row, so row 1, column 2 is (1,2). Yes.\n\nSo the answer should be to flag (1,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (1, 2)","flag (1, 2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, let's recall the rules and the current state of the board. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0 to 13, which might be a formatting error, but I'll focus on the visible cells. There are 10 mines total, and the score is based on correctly flagged mines. The current flags are 2 out of 19, but that might be a typo (probably 2 flagged, 19 is maybe a mistake). The board has some numbers and flags already.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's list out the visible cells with their coordinates. Let's assume the rows are 0-8 (since it's 9x9) and the columns are 0-8. The input shows row 0 as: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (maybe columns 0-8). Let's correct the row indices. So row 0, columns 0-8: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, etc. Row 1: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (flagged), (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, etc. Row 2: (2,0)=F (flagged), (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, etc.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or determine where mines must be.\n\nStarting with (0,0)=0. A 0 means none of the 8 adjacent cells have mines. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,0) is 0, so those three cells are safe. However, (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3, which are all numbers, so that checks out.\n\n(0,1)=1. The adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. So (0,1) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Let's count the adjacent cells: (0,0) is safe, (0,2)=1 (number, so safe), (1,0)=2 (safe), (1,1)=3 (safe), (1,2)=F (flagged as mine). So the 1 mine here is the flagged cell (1,2). That makes sense because (0,1) has 1 mine, which is (1,2). So (1,2) is correctly flagged as a mine.\n\n(0,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. The adjacent cells: (0,1) safe, (0,3) safe, (1,1) safe, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3) safe. So (0,2) has 1 mine, which is (1,2). That matches, so (1,2) is a confirmed mine.\n\n(0,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. Let's count the known mines here. (1,2)=F is a mine. So (0,3) has 2 mines, so there's 1 more mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells here are (0,4), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3). (1,3)=2 is a number, so it's safe. (2,2)=2 is a number, safe. So possible mines could be (0,4), (1,4), (2,3).\n\nRow 1: (1,0)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?. So (1,0) has 2 mines. Known mines: (2,0)=F. So that's 1 mine, so there's 1 more mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells: (0,0) safe, (0,1) safe, (1,1)=3 (safe), (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=?. So the second mine must be (2,1). Because (1,0) has 2 mines, so (2,1) is a mine.\n\n(1,1)=3. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2. Let's count mines here. (1,2)=F (mine), (2,0)=F (mine). So that's 2 mines. (1,1) is 3, so there's 1 more mine. The remaining adjacent cells are (2,1). So (2,1) must be a mine. That confirms our previous conclusion: (2,1) is a mine. So we should flag (2,1), but the user might need to uncover safe cells first.\n\n(1,2)=F is already flagged, and we confirmed it's a mine.\n\n(1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. (1,3)=2, so there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. Known mine: (1,2)=F. So 1 more mine. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (2,2)=2 is a number, so safe. So possible mines here could be (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nRow 2: (2,0)=F is flagged. From (1,0)=2, we saw that (2,0) is a mine, so that's correct.\n\n(2,1)=? We concluded it's a mine (from (1,0)=2 and (1,1)=3). So (2,1) should be flagged, but maybe we need to confirm.\n\n(2,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=?. (2,2)=2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. Known mine: (1,2)=F. So 1 more mine. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). If (2,1) is a mine (as we thought), then (2,2) would have (1,2)=F and (2,1)=mine, totaling 2, which matches (2,2)=2. So that's correct. So (2,1) is a mine.\n\nSo (2,1) is a mine. So if the user hasn't flagged it yet, they should flag it, but maybe they need to uncover safe cells first.\n\nNow, looking for safe cells to uncover. Let's look at (0,0)=0. The adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all uncovered. The 0 cell's adjacent cells are all safe, so no help there.\n\n(0,1)=1. Its adjacent cells are all uncovered except maybe some, but we already checked.\n\n(0,2)=1. Same as above.\n\n(1,0)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,1) is a mine, so (1,0) is covered.\n\n(1,1)=3. Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). All except (2,2) are either uncovered or mines. (2,2)=2 is uncovered, so that's safe.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover. For example, (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=2. (0,3)=2 has adjacent mines: (1,2)=F and one more. If (0,4) is safe, then the mine would be in (1,4), (2,3), etc. But maybe there's a cell with a number that indicates adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells with numbers that have all adjacent mines already flagged, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, (0,3)=2. It has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. The known mine here is (1,2)=F. So (0,3)=2 needs one more mine. If (0,3) has 2 mines, and one is (1,2), then the other could be (2,3). Let's check (2,2)=2. (2,2) has adjacent mines: (1,2)=F and (2,1)=mine (if that's confirmed). So (2,2)=2 is covered.\n\nWait, (2,1) is a mine, so (2,2) is adjacent to (2,1)=mine and (1,2)=mine, which is 2 mines, matching (2,2)=2. That's correct.\n\nNow, (1,0)=2: adjacent mines are (2,0)=F and (2,1)=mine, which is 2, so (1,0) is covered.\n\n(1,1)=3: adjacent mines are (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=mine. That's 3 mines, which matches (1,1)=3. Perfect, so (1,1)=3 is covered.\n\nSo (1,1)=3 has all 3 mines adjacent flagged (if (2,1) is flagged). But (2,1) is currently '?', so if (2,1) is a mine, then the user should flag it. But the user might not know that yet. However, based on the numbers, (2,1) must be a mine.\n\nBut the user's current action is to uncover a cell, flag, or unflag. Since the score is based on correctly flagged mines, but the user needs to uncover safe cells to win by uncovering all safe cells.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (3,0). Let's check the adjacent cells of (3,0). (3,0) is in row 3, column 0. Its adjacent cells are (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=? (mine), (3,1)=?, (4,0)=?. But we don't have info on (3,0)'s adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (0,4). The cell (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=2. (0,3) has 2 mines. We know (1,2)=F is a mine. So (0,3) has one more mine. Let's see the adjacent cells of (0,3): (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. The (1,3)=2 cell: (1,3) has 2 mines. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. (1,3)=2, so 2 mines. We know (1,2)=F is one, so one more. So (1,3) and (0,3) both need one more mine. If the mine is (2,3), then both (0,3) and (1,3) would have that mine as adjacent. Let's check: (0,3) adjacent to (2,3): yes (diagonally down-right). (1,3) adjacent to (2,3): yes (down). So if (2,3) is a mine, then (0,3)=2 (mines at (1,2) and (2,3)) and (1,3)=2 (mines at (1,2) and (2,3)) would both be satisfied. That's possible. So (2,3) could be a mine.\n\nIf that's the case, then (0,4) and (1,4) are adjacent to (0,3)=2 and (1,3)=2, but if (2,3) is the mine, then (0,4) and (1,4) are safe. Let's check (0,4): adjacent cells are (0,3)=2, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?. If (0,4) is uncovered and is a number, it might help, but maybe there's a safer cell.\n\nAnother cell: (2,3). If (2,3) is a mine, then we shouldn't uncover it. But if (2,3) is not a mine, then uncovering it would show a number. But we need to find a cell that's definitely safe.\n\nLet's look at (3,2). (3,2) is adjacent to (2,2)=2. (2,2) has 2 mines: (1,2)=F and (2,1)=mine. So (2,2)=2's adjacent cells are all accounted for. Therefore, the cells adjacent to (2,2) that are not mines are safe. (2,2) is at (2,2). Its adjacent cells are (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=mine, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=?. Since (2,2)=2 has mines at (1,2)=F and (2,1)=mine, the other adjacent cells (1,1)=3 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=? are safe. So (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are all safe. Because (2,2)=2 has exactly 2 mines, so the other adjacent cells are safe. That's a key point!\n\nYes, (2,2) is a cell with value 2. The adjacent cells to (2,2) are 8 cells. We've identified two of them as mines: (1,2)=F and (2,1)=mine. The remaining 6 adjacent cells are (1,1)=3 (already uncovered, safe), (1,3)=2 (already uncovered, safe), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=?, (3,3)=?. Since (2,2) has exactly 2 mines, the remaining adjacent cells (the ? ones) must be safe. Therefore, (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3) are all safe and can be uncovered safely.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover one of these safe cells. Let's pick (3,2) as an example. Alternatively, (3,1) or (3,3), but (3,2) is a good choice.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,2)","uncover (3,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current board and the game state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows some rows and columns with numbers, flags, and unknowns. Let's parse the current board provided.\n\nThe user mentioned the input format, so the actions are uncover, flag, or unflag. The score is based on correctly flagged mines over total (10), and right now they have 2 flags out of 19, which probably means 2 flags placed, 19 total possible? Wait, maybe the \"Flags: 2\/19\" is 2 flags placed, 19 cells flagged? Not sure, but maybe that's just a status.\n\nThe win condition is either correctly flag all mines (10) or uncover all safe cells (9x9=81 cells minus 10 mines=71 safe cells). The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's list out the visible cells. The rows are labeled from 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9), but the current board display shows rows 0 to 13? Wait, maybe the user made a formatting error. Let me check again. The Current Board is written as:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, 9x9 grid, so each row should have 9 cells. Maybe the user's formatting is off. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells. So perhaps the first row is 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (9 cells). Then row 1: 2 3 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?. Row 2: F ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?. Row 3: ? ? 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?. Rows 4-8: all ?. That makes more sense as a 9x9 grid.\n\nSo let's correct the board:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [2, 3, F, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, ?, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells. Let's start with row 0, column 0: it's 0, meaning no adjacent mines. So all 8 adjacent cells (but since (0,0) is a corner, adjacent are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)) must be safe. Let's check:\n\nRow 0, column 0 (0,0) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1) is 1 (which is a number, so safe), (1,0) is 2 (safe), (1,1) is 3 (safe). That's consistent.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. Let's list adjacent cells for (0,1): (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). Among these, (1,2) is flagged (F). If that F is a correct mine, then (0,1)'s 1 is satisfied because there's 1 mine (the F). That makes sense. So (1,2) is a flagged mine, which could be correct.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent. The adjacent cells with possible mines are (1,2)=F. So if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,2)'s 1 is correct. That checks out.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. The 2 here means there are 2 mines in adjacent. Let's count possible mines here. (1,2) is F (maybe a mine). Are there others? Let's see (2,2) is 2, which is a number, so safe. (1,3) is 2, safe. So adjacent cells to (0,3) are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3). So possible mines: (1,2) (if F is correct) and maybe another. Let's hold that thought.\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is F (flagged). So if (2,0) is a mine, then we need one more mine in adjacent. The other possible cell is (2,1). So (1,0)=2 implies that either (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (if (2,0) is a mine) or (2,0) is not a mine and two others, but (2,0) is flagged, so maybe (2,0) is a mine, and (2,1) is a mine. But let's check row 2, column 0 (2,0) is F. Let's look at row 2, column 0's adjacent cells. (2,0) is in row 2, column 0. Adjacent cells: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. If (2,0) is a mine, then those adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1) would have their numbers increased by 1. But (1,0) is 2, which we thought might have 2 mines adjacent. If (2,0) is a mine, then (1,0) has (2,0) as one mine, so another mine must be in (2,1) (since (0,0) and (0,1) are safe). So (1,0)=2 implies (2,0) and (2,1) are mines.\n\nRow 1, column 1 (1,1) is 3. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2. The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent. Let's count possible mines. (1,2) is F, (2,0) is F. If both are mines, that's 2. Then we need one more. The remaining adjacent cells are (2,1). So (2,1) must be a mine. That would make 3 mines: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1). Let's check if that fits. (1,1)=3 would then have 3 mines, which matches. Let's verify with other cells.\n\nRow 1, column 2 (1,2) is F (flagged). Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. If (1,2) is a mine, then each of those adjacent cells would have their numbers increased by 1. For example, (0,1)=1: if (1,2) is a mine, then (0,1) has 1 mine, which matches. (0,2)=1: same, (1,2) is a mine, so (0,2) has 1 mine. (1,1)=3: if (1,2) is a mine, then that's one of the 3. (2,2)=2: if (1,2) is a mine, then (2,2) has 2 mines in adjacent, which would need to be other cells. So that seems consistent.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent. If (1,2) is a mine (F), then that's one. So we need one more mine in adjacent cells. Possible candidates: (2,2) is 2 (safe), (0,3) is 2 (safe). So maybe (2,3) or (1,4) or (0,4) or (2,4). Let's check (2,2)=2.\n\nRow 2, column 2 (2,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent. Let's list adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,2) is F (mine candidate), (2,1) is a candidate (from earlier, (1,0)=2 and (1,1)=3 imply (2,1) is a mine). If (2,1) is a mine, that's one. (1,2) is a mine, that's two. So (2,2)=2 would then have 2 mines, which matches. Perfect! So (2,1) and (1,2) are mines. That fits.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent. Since (2,2)=2, which we determined has (2,1) and (1,2) as mines, but (2,1) is adjacent to (3,2) only if (2,1) is adjacent. (3,2) is (row 3, column 2). Adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1) is row 2, column 1, which is adjacent to (3,2) (since row 2, column 1 is up-left of row 3, column 2). So if (2,1) is a mine, then (3,2)=1 would have 1 mine in adjacent, which matches. That works. So (2,1) is a mine, which is consistent with all previous numbers.\n\nNow, let's recap the mines we've identified so far:\n\n- (1,2) is flagged (F), and based on the numbers, it's a correct mine.\n- (2,0) is flagged (F), let's check if that's a mine. From row 1, column 0 (1,0)=2. (1,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,1)=3 (safe), (2,0)=F (flagged), (2,1)=? (which we think is a mine). So (1,0)=2 requires two mines in adjacent. If (2,0) is a mine and (2,1) is a mine, that's two, which matches. So (2,0) is a mine (flagged correctly), and (2,1) is a mine (unflagged yet).\n\nSo far, the flags are at (1,2) and (2,0), which are both mines (so correct flags, contributing to the score). The user's current Flags: 2\/19, which probably means 2 flags placed, 19 cells in total flagged? Not sure, but the score is 0.105..., which is 2\/19? 2 divided by 19 is ~0.105, so that's likely. So the 2 flags are (1,2) and (2,0), but there are 19 total flags (maybe a typo, but not important now).\n\nNow, the next step is to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that must be safe.\n\nLet's look at row 0, column 0 (0,0)=0. All adjacent cells are uncovered (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all numbers, so no more to uncover there.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1)=1. Adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. All uncovered except (1,2) which is flagged, so no new info here.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2)=1. Adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. All uncovered except (0,3) and (1,3), which are numbers, so no new cells here.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent. We know (1,2) is a mine (1), so there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (1,4), (2,3). So (0,3)=2 has 1 mine (1,2) and needs 1 more. So among (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), one is a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?. We determined (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, so (2,1) is a mine. So (2,1) is a mine, which is currently unknown (marked as ? in row 2, column 1). So we should not uncover (2,1), it's a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 1 (1,1)=3. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2. We have (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) as mines (3 total), which matches the 3, so that's correct.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. (1,2) is a mine (1), so (1,3)=2 needs 1 more mine in adjacent. Possible cells: (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nRow 2, column 0 (2,0)=F (flagged mine). Adjacent cells: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. Since (2,0) is a mine, (3,0) and (3,1) are adjacent but their numbers are unknown.\n\nRow 2, column 1 (2,1)=? (mine, as per earlier analysis). So we should avoid uncovering this.\n\nRow 2, column 2 (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=?. We have (1,2) and (2,1) as mines (2 total), which matches the 2. So (2,2) is safe.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. Since (2,1) is a mine (adjacent to (3,2)), that's 1 mine, so (3,2)=1 is satisfied. Therefore, all other adjacent cells to (3,2) are safe. So (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=? are all safe except (2,1). So (3,2)=1 implies that (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are safe. That's a key point!\n\nSo (3,2)=1 has only one adjacent mine (which is (2,1)), so all other adjacent cells must be safe. Therefore, (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLet's list those safe cells:\n\n- (2,3): row 2, column 3\n- (3,1): row 3, column 1\n- (3,3): row 3, column 3\n- (4,1): row 4, column 1\n- (4,2): row 4, column 2\n- (4,3): row 4, column 3\n\nThese are all safe. Let's pick one to uncover. The first one in order might be (3,1), (3,3), (2,3), etc. Let's check if any of these are already uncovered. Looking at the current board:\n\nRow 2: [F, ?, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] → (2,3) is ?\nRow 3: [?, ?, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] → (3,1) is ?, (3,3) is ?\nRow 4: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] → (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are ?\n\nSo all these cells are unknown. Let's pick (3,1) as a candidate. Alternatively, (3,3) or (2,3). Let's see if there's more info.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 3, column 0 (3,0)=?. Adjacent to (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=? (mine), (3,1)=?, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. Since (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, (3,0)'s adjacent mines would be 2, but (3,0) is unknown, so we can't be sure.\n\nBut back to the safe cells from (3,2)=1. Let's choose (3,1) to uncover. Let's confirm: (3,1) is adjacent to (3,2)=1. Since (3,2) has only one mine (2,1), (3,1) is safe. So uncovering (3,1) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, (3,3) is also safe. Let's pick (3,1) as the action.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,1)","uncover (3,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, let's recall the rules and the current board state. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0 to 13, which might be a typo, but probably it's a 9x9 grid. The user has flagged 2 mines, with 19 flags in total (maybe a mistake, but the score is 0.105, which is 2\/19, but total mines are 10, so maybe the Flags: 2\/19 is a display error. Anyway, total mines are 10, so correct flags are 2, and 8 left to flag correctly.\n\nThe current board shows some uncovered cells with numbers, some '?', and a few 'F's. Let's parse the board rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Let's list the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (assuming 9 columns, 0-8)\nRow 1: [2, 3, F, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, ?, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, 3, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nLet's note the positions of the F (flags). In row 1, column 2 (1,2) is F. In row 2, column 0 (2,0) is F. These are the flagged cells. Now, the numbers indicate the number of adjacent mines. Let's analyze the known numbers to find safe cells or confirm mines.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0 (0,0) is 0. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,0) is 0, so those three cells are safe. Let's check if they are uncovered: (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3. All are uncovered, which matches.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,2) is 1 (uncovered), (1,0) is 2 (uncovered), (1,1) is 3 (uncovered), (1,2) is F (flagged). So (0,1) is 1, which means exactly one mine in adjacent cells. The flagged cell (1,2) is a mine candidate. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. So (0,2)=1, which would mean one mine in adjacent. The F at (1,2) could be that mine. Then (0,3) and (1,3) are 2 and 2. Let's check (1,3) which is 2. Its adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=1, (1,2)=F, (2,2)=2. So (1,3)=2: adjacent mines are (1,2) (if F is correct) and maybe another.\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F. So (1,0)=2: adjacent mines are (2,0) (F) and one more. The possible cells here are (2,1) because (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are uncovered. So (2,1) might be a mine, but (1,1) is 3. Let's check (1,1)=3. Adjacent cells: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F. So the adjacent cells are 8 cells. The count is 3. So far, two F's: (1,2) and (2,0). If both are mines, that's 2. Then there's one more mine in the adjacent cells. The remaining cells are (2,1) and (2,2). (2,2) is 2 (uncovered). So (2,2) is a number, so not a mine. So (2,1) must be a mine. That would make (1,1)=3: 2 F's (mines) + (2,1) mine = 3. That works. So (2,1) is a mine. So (2,1) should be flagged. But the current board for row 2, column 1 is '?', so maybe we can flag it, but let's check other cells.\n\nRow 3, column 1 (3,1) is 3. Adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,0)=F, (2,1)=mine (from above), (2,2)=2. So (3,1)=3: if (2,0) and (2,1) are mines, that's 2, so there's one more mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells here are (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,2) is 1 (row 3, column 2 is 1). Let's check (3,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=2, (3,1)=3. So (3,2)=1: adjacent mines should be 1. Since (2,1) is a mine, that's 1, so the rest of the adjacent cells are safe. So (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (2,3) are safe. That's helpful.\n\nSo (3,2)=1: since (2,1) is a mine (adjacent), the other adjacent cells have 0 mines. So (3,3) is safe. So (3,3) can be uncovered. Let's check the current board: row 3, column 3 is '?'. So uncovering (3,3) would be safe.\n\nAnother area: row 0, column 3 is 2. Let's see (0,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2)=1, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2. So (0,3)=2: adjacent mines are (1,2) (mine) and one more. (1,3)=2: adjacent mines. Let's check (1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,2)=1, (1,2)=F, (2,2)=2. So (1,3)=2: mines are (1,2) (mine) and one more. The possible cells here are (0,4) or (1,4) or (2,3) or (2,4). But (0,3)=2, which needs two mines. If (1,2) is one, then the other is in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), or (2,4). Maybe not enough info here.\n\nBack to (3,3). Since (3,2)=1, and (2,1) is a mine, the adjacent cells of (3,2) (which include (3,3)) are safe. So (3,3) is safe. Uncovering (3,3) would reveal a number, which could help. Let's confirm: (3,2) is 1, which has adjacent cell (3,3). Since (3,2) has exactly one mine in its adjacent cells, which is (2,1), then (3,3) must be safe. So the best move is to uncover (3,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,3)","uncover (3,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but in the Current Board section, it's written as rows with 12 elements each, which might be a typo, but probably it's a 9x9. Let me check the input again. Oh, the Minesweeper Game Rules say it's a 9x9 grid, so maybe the Current Board display has a formatting error, perhaps each row is 9 cells. Let's assume that.\n\nThe Current Board rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 2 3 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: F ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? 3 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nThe coordinates are (row, col) starting at (0,0) top-left.\n\nFirst, let's note the known cells and flagged cells. The flags are at (1,2) and (2,0), as per the board:\n\nRow 1: 2 3 F 2... → (1,2) is F.\n\nRow 2: F ? 2... → (2,0) is F.\n\nThe Score is 0.105263..., which is 2\/19, but total mines are 10, so maybe the Flags count is 2\/19 (incorrectly flagged 17, correctly 2?), but the Win Condition is correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or uncovering a mine.\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0 is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. So (0,0) is a 0, so adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. But row 0, column 0 is 0, row 0, column 1 is 1, row 0, column 2 is 1, row 0, column 3 is 2.\n\nRow 0, column 0 (0,0) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Let's check those. (0,1) is 1, which is a number, so already uncovered. (1,0) is 2 (row 1, column 0), which is uncovered. (1,1) is 3 (row 1, column 1), uncovered. So those are safe, which makes sense.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. So the 1 here indicates that among its 8 neighbors, there's 1 mine. The neighbors are (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (1,0)=2 (safe), (1,1)=3 (safe), (1,2)=F (flagged). So the 1 in (0,1) must have exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The flagged cell (1,2) is a neighbor here. So if (1,2) is a correct flag (mine), then that accounts for the 1 in (0,1). That makes sense. So (1,2) is likely a correct mine.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (1,2)=F. So again, if (1,2) is a mine, that's 1, so that's correct. So (0,2) is 1, which is satisfied by (1,2) being a mine.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?. The 2 here means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (possible mine) and maybe others. Let's check (1,3) which is 2 (row 1, column 3).\n\nRow 1, column 0 (1,0) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (2,0)=F (flagged). So if (2,0) is a mine, then there's 1 mine here, so there must be another mine in (2,1) or (1,1) or (0,1). But (1,1) is 3 (row 1, column 1) which is a number, so it's safe. (0,1) is 1, safe. So (2,0) is F, and (1,0) is 2. So 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells for (1,0) are (0,0) [safe], (0,1) [safe], (1,1) [safe], (2,0) [F], (2,1) [?], (0,-1) invalid, (1,-1) invalid, (2,-1) invalid. So only (2,0) and (2,1) are possible. Since (1,0) is 2, there must be 2 mines here. So (2,0) is F (mine) and (2,1) must also be a mine. Because 2 mines needed: (2,0) is 1, so (2,1) must be the second. So (2,1) is a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 1 (1,1) is 3. Its adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2. The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's count the known flags: (1,2)=F and (2,0)=F. If both are mines, that's 2. Then (2,1) is a possible mine (from (1,0)=2 analysis). So (2,1) would be the third mine. So (1,1)=3 is satisfied by (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) being mines. That adds up: 3 mines. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 1, column 2 (1,2) is F (flagged). As per above, it's likely a correct mine.\n\nRow 1, column 3 (1,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (mine), so that's 1. So there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. Let's see (2,2) is 2 (row 2, column 2).\n\nRow 2, column 0 (2,0) is F (flagged). As per (1,0)=2 analysis, it's a mine.\n\nRow 2, column 2 (2,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (mine) and (2,1)=? (possible mine from earlier). If (2,1) is a mine, that's 1, so there's 1 more. Let's check (3,2)=1 (row 3, column 2).\n\nRow 3, column 1 (3,1) is 3. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (2,0)=F (mine), and (2,1)=? (possible mine). If (2,1) is a mine, that's 2. So there's 1 more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (2,1) (but (2,1) is already counted), (2,2) is safe, (3,2) is 1 (safe), etc. Maybe (3,0) is a mine?\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (2,1) is a mine (from earlier), then (2,1) is adjacent to (3,2) (since (2,1) is row 2, column 1; (3,2) is row 3, column 2: they are diagonally adjacent? No, (2,1) is (row 2, col 1), (3,2) is (row 3, col 2). The distance is (1,1), so they are diagonally adjacent. So (2,1) is a neighbor of (3,2). So if (2,1) is a mine, that's 1 mine for (3,2)=1, which fits. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (3,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (2,3)=? and (2,4)=? etc.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. A safe cell is one that is guaranteed to be a number (not a mine). For example, cells adjacent to 0s can be uncovered, but in the current board, the 0 is at (0,0), and its adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 4 (0,4) is ?. Let's see if we can determine if it's safe. The cell (0,3) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (0,4). The 2 in (0,3) has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,4)=? (unknown), (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=? (unknown), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=? (unknown). The 2 in (0,3) needs 2 mines in its adjacent cells. We already have (1,2)=F (mine), so that's 1. So there's 1 more mine among (0,4), (1,4), (2,3). So (0,4) could be a mine or safe. Not sure yet.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 (3,0) is ?. Let's check (3,1)=3. (3,1) has adjacent cells (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=? (possible mine), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1 (safe), (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The 3 in (3,1) needs 3 mines. So if (2,1) is a mine (from (1,0)=2 analysis: (1,0)=2 has (2,0)=F and (2,1)=mine, so 2 mines), then (2,1) is a mine (count 1). (2,0)=F is a mine (count 2). So (3,1)=3 needs 3 mines, so there must be one more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAnother area: row 2, column 1 (2,1) is ?. From (1,0)=2: (1,0) has adjacent cells (2,0)=F (mine) and (2,1). Since (1,0)=2, there must be 2 mines here, so (2,1) must be a mine. So (2,1) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,1). But the user's current action options are uncover, flag, unflag. However, the problem is asking for the next action. But maybe there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nWait, let's look at row 3, column 4 (3,4). The user's example action is 'uncover (3,4)'. Let's check (3,3)=1. (3,3) is 1, so its adjacent cells have 1 mine. (3,3) is at (row 3, column 3). Its adjacent cells are (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in those 8 cells. Let's see (2,3)=? (row 2, column 3). What's adjacent to (2,3)? Let's check (1,3)=2. (1,3) is 2, which has adjacent cells (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?. The 2 in (1,3) needs 2 mines. We have (1,2)=F (mine), so 1 mine. So there's 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4). So (2,3) could be a mine or not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Let's check the cell (3,3)=1. If (3,3) is 1, and (3,4) is adjacent to it. If (3,4) is a mine, then (3,3) would have at least 1 mine (itself), but (3,3) is 1, so maybe. But maybe (3,4) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, column 0 (4,0) which is ?. But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: the cells that are adjacent to numbers and have known counts. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, which we've covered. Row 1, column 0 is 2, which we determined (2,0) and (2,1) are mines. So (2,1) should be flagged, but maybe the user hasn't flagged it yet. The current flags are (1,2) and (2,0). So (2,1) is a mine, so we should flag (2,1). But the problem is, the user's current action could be to flag that. But let's check if that's the case.\n\nBut maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's check (3,4). Let's see, (3,3) is 1. (3,3) has adjacent cells. If (3,4) is uncovered, and it's a number, that might help. Alternatively, (3,0) is ?, but maybe it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 3 (2,3) which is ?. (2,2) is 2. (2,2) has adjacent cells (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2, (2,1)=? (mine), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1. The 2 in (2,2) needs 2 mines. We have (1,2)=F (mine) and (2,1)=mine (from earlier), so that's 2 mines. So (2,2)=2 is satisfied. Therefore, (2,3) is not a mine, because (2,2) already has its 2 mines. So (2,3) is safe. Therefore, (2,3) can be uncovered.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (2,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1)=3 (safe), (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,1)=? (mine), (2,3)=? (unknown), (3,1)=3 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe).\n\nSo the mines adjacent to (2,2) are (1,2)=F (mine) and (2,1)=mine (since (1,0)=2 requires (2,0) and (2,1) to be mines). So that's 2 mines, which matches the 2 in (2,2). Therefore, (2,3) is not a mine. So (2,3) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nSo (2,3) is a safe cell. Let's check its coordinates: row 2, column 3. So (2,3). Uncovering that would be a good move.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,4). Let's see (3,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=? (safe, as per above), (2,4)=? (unknown), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,4)=? (unknown), (4,2)=? (unknown), (4,3)=? (unknown), (4,4)=? (unknown). Since (2,3) is safe, (3,3)=1's mine could be (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), etc. But (3,4) might be safe.\n\nBut (2,3) is definitely safe. So uncovering (2,3) is a safe move.\n\nLet me check again. (2,2)=2. The adjacent mines are (1,2) and (2,1). So (2,3) is not a mine. So (2,3) can be uncovered.\n\nSo the action should be 'uncover (2,3)'.\n\nWait, but let's confirm the coordinates. The rows are 0-based. The Current Board shows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ?\n\nRow 1: 2 3 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\n\nRow 2: F ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nSo row 2, column 3 is the 4th element (since columns are 0-based). The row 2 is \"F ? 2 ? ...\", so columns 0: F, 1: ?, 2: 2, 3: ?. So (2,3) is the cell in row 2, column 3, which is the 4th element (0,1,2,3). Yes.\n\nSo uncovering (2,3) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,3)","uncover (2,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a partial board, but wait, the original problem says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 14 rows? That might be a typo, maybe it's 9 rows. Let me check again. Oh, the input shows rows 0 to 13, which is 14 rows, but the game is 9x9. Maybe that's a formatting error. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nLooking at the current board rows 0 to 3 (since others are all '?'):\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? (assuming 9 columns, so columns 0-8)\nRow 1: 2 3 F 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: F ? 2 2 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? 3 1 1 ? ? ? ? ?\n\nFirst, let's note the coordinates. Let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nKnown cells:\n\nRow 0:\n(0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2\n\nRow 1:\n(1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (flagged), (1,3)=2\n\nRow 2:\n(2,0)=F (flagged), (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2\n\nRow 3:\n(3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1\n\nFlags: There are two flags currently: (1,2) and (2,0). The score is 2\/19, which is 0.105..., but total mines are 10, so maybe that's a typo. The user says \"Flags: 2\/19\" which is confusing. Probably, the correct total mines are 10, so maybe the 19 is a mistake. Anyway, the goal is to flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLet's analyze the known numbers to find safe cells or mine cells.\n\nStarting with (0,0)=0. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,0) is 0, so those three cells are safe. Wait, (0,0) is top-left corner, so adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, those three have 0 mines. But (0,1) is 1, which is a number, so that's already uncovered. (1,0) is 2, which is uncovered. (1,1) is 3, uncovered. So that's consistent.\n\nNext, (0,1)=1. The number 1 means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,1) are: (0,0)=0 (safe), (0,2)=1 (uncovered), (1,0)=2 (uncovered), (1,1)=3 (uncovered), (1,2)=F (flagged). So the adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). Since (0,1)=1, there should be 1 mine in these. (1,2) is flagged, so if that's a correct mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So (1,2) being a mine here is possible. That's one of the flags.\n\n(0,2)=1. Adjacent cells to (0,2): (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. So (0,2)=1 means 1 mine in these. The flagged cell (1,2) is adjacent here. If (1,2) is a mine, then that's 1, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\n(0,3)=2. Adjacent cells to (0,3): (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?. So (0,3)=2: the adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The known ones are (0,2) (safe), (1,2) (flagged mine), (1,3) (uncovered). So the 2 here: if (1,2) is a mine (1), then there should be 1 more mine in (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nRow 1, (1,0)=2. Adjacent cells to (1,0): (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?. So (1,0)=2: adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (2,0) is flagged as a mine. So if (2,0) is a mine (1), then there's 1 more mine in (2,1) or maybe (1,1) is 3, but (1,1) is a number, not a mine. So (1,0)=2: 2 mines in adjacent cells. (2,0) is F (mine), so another mine must be in (2,1). Because (0,0) is 0 (no mine), (0,1) is 1 (no mine), (1,1) is 3 (no mine). So (2,1) must be a mine. Because 2 mines needed, one is (2,0), the other is (2,1). So (2,1) should be a mine. But currently, (2,1) is '?', so maybe we should flag it?\n\nWait, (1,0)=2: adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, no mine), (0,1) (1, no mine), (1,1) (3, no mine), (2,0) (F, mine), (2,1) (unknown). So total mines here: 1 (from F) plus (2,1). So (2,1) must be a mine. So (2,1) is a mine. So we should flag (2,1).\n\nRow 1, (1,1)=3. Adjacent cells to (1,1): (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2. So (1,1)=3: there are 3 mines in these adjacent cells. Let's count knowns: (1,2)=F (mine), (2,0)=F (mine). So that's 2. Then, (2,1) we just deduced is a mine (from (1,0)=2). So that's 3 mines. That matches (1,1)=3. Perfect. So (2,1) is a mine. So (2,1) should be flagged.\n\nRow 1, (1,2)=F (flagged). Let's check (1,2)'s adjacent cells. (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2. Since (1,2) is flagged as a mine, the numbers around it should account for that. For example, (0,2)=1: adjacent to (1,2) which is a mine, so that's 1 mine, which matches. (1,1)=3: adjacent to (1,2) (mine), which is part of the 3. (1,3)=2: adjacent to (1,2) (mine), so (1,3)=2 should have 2 mines in its adjacent cells, one of which is (1,2). Let's check (1,3)=2.\n\n(1,3)=2: adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?. So (1,3)=2: the known mine is (1,2)=F. So there's 1 mine accounted for, so there should be 1 more mine in the adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,4), (2,4), (2,2), (2,3). (2,2)=2 and (2,3)=2 are uncovered, so they are safe. So (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) could have 1 mine.\n\nRow 2, (2,0)=F (flagged). Let's check (2,0)'s adjacent cells: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=3. (2,0) is a mine, so (1,0)=2 should have 2 mines adjacent, which we already considered (2,0) and (2,1). (1,1)=3 has (2,0) as a mine, which is part of the 3. (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0), which is a mine, so (3,0) is a cell that, when uncovered, will have at least 1 mine in its adjacent cells.\n\nRow 2, (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1. (2,2)=2: the adjacent mines. (1,2)=F (mine) is one. So there should be 1 more mine here. (2,1) is a mine (from earlier), so that's another. So 1 (F) + 1 (mine at (2,1)) = 2, which matches (2,2)=2. Perfect.\n\nRow 2, (2,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=?. (2,3)=2: adjacent mines. (1,2)=F (mine) is one. So need 1 more. Let's check (3,3)=1. (3,3)=1 is at row 3, column 3. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. (3,3)=1: there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells include (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe). So possible mines in (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Since (3,3)=1, only one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 3, (3,1)=3. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. (3,1)=3: needs 3 mines in adjacent cells. (2,0)=F (mine) is one. (2,1)=mine (from earlier) is another. So that's 2, so need 1 more. So either (3,0) or (4,0) or (4,1) or (4,2) is a mine.\n\nRow 3, (3,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. (3,2)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. (2,1) is a mine (from earlier), so that's 1. That matches (3,2)=1. Perfect! So (2,1) is definitely a mine. So (2,1) should be flagged.\n\nRow 3, (3,3)=1. As before, adjacent cells. We know (2,3)=2 is safe, (3,2)=1 is safe, (2,2)=2 is safe. So the mine here is likely in (2,4), (3,4), (4,3), etc. But (3,3)=1, so only one mine there.\n\nNow, let's summarize the deductions:\n\n- (2,1) must be a mine (from (1,0)=2 and (1,1)=3 and (2,2)=2 and (3,2)=1). So we should flag (2,1).\n\nBut the current action options are uncover, flag, or unflag. The user's current flags are (1,2) and (2,0). So adding (2,1) as a flag would be a good move. But let's check if there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, are there any cells that are definitely safe? Let's look for 0s. (0,0)=0, which we already know, but its adjacent cells are all uncovered. (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, etc. What about (3,3)=1? Its adjacent cells: (3,3) is 1, so one mine in adjacent. If (2,4) is a mine, then (3,4) could be safe? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (3,4). It's in row 3, column 4. Let's see adjacent cells to (3,4): (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?.\n\nBut maybe there's a better cell. Let's check (0,4). (0,4) is in row 0, column 4. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=2, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?. (0,3)=2 has adjacent cells including (0,4) and (1,4). (0,3)=2: we know (1,2)=F (mine) is adjacent, so (0,3)=2 needs 1 more mine in (0,4) or (1,4). So (0,4) and (1,4) have one mine between them.\n\nIf we can find a cell that's safe, let's uncover it. For example, (3,4) is currently '?'. Let's see if there's a way to determine if it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, (4,0) is in row 4, column 0. Adjacent cells: (3,0)=?, (3,1)=3, (4,1)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?. Not sure.\n\nWait, let's go back to (2,1). Since we deduced it's a mine, we should flag it. The current flags are (1,2) and (2,0). So flagging (2,1) would be the next step. So the action would be 'flag (2,1)'.\n\nBut let's confirm again. (1,0)=2: adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, no mine), (0,1) (1, no mine), (1,1) (3, no mine), (2,0) (F, mine), (2,1) (unknown). So 2 mines needed: (2,0) is 1, so (2,1) must be the second. So (2,1) is a mine. Therefore, flagging (2,1) is correct.\n\nAnswer: flag (2,1)","flag (2,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed here might be a bit confusing. Wait, the first line shows 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?, which is 13 elements, but Minesweeper is 9x9. Maybe there's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers are separated by spaces. Let's assume rows 0 to 8, columns 0 to 8. Let's parse the current board properly.\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (since 9 columns)\nRow 1: [2, 3, F, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, F, 2, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, 3, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nNow, let's recall that there are 10 mines in total. The current flags are 3\/19, which might mean 3 flags placed, but 19 is the total flags (maybe a typo, but the score is 0.1578, which is 3\/19, but 10 mines total. Maybe the 'Flags: 3\/19' is a mistake, perhaps 3 flags placed, 19 cells flagged? No, probably 3 correct flags out of 19 attempted, but the actual mines are 10. Anyway, focus on the board.\n\nLet's look at the known cells. Let's start with row 0, column 0 (0,0) which is 0. A 0 means no adjacent mines. So all 8 neighbors of (0,0) are safe. The neighbors are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,0) is top-left, so neighbors are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,0) is 0, so those cells are safe. Let's check row 0, column 1 is 1. That's adjacent to (0,0) (which is 0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). The 1 at (0,1) has 1 mine in those adjacent cells. (0,0) is 0, so no mine there. (1,0) is in row 1, column 0, which is 2. Wait, row 1 is [2, 3, F, 2, ...], so (1,0) is 2. (1,1) is 3. (0,2) is 1. Let's map out the known numbers and flags.\n\nRow 0:\n(0,0)=0\n(0,1)=1\n(0,2)=1\n(0,3)=2\n(0,4)=?\n(0,5)=?\n(0,6)=?\n(0,7)=?\n(0,8)=?\n\nRow 1:\n(1,0)=2\n(1,1)=3\n(1,2)=F (flagged)\n(1,3)=2\n(1,4)=?\n...\n\nRow 2:\n(2,0)=F (flagged)\n(2,1)=F (flagged)\n(2,2)=2\n(2,3)=2\n...\n\nRow 3:\n(3,0)=?\n(3,1)=3\n(3,2)=1\n(3,3)=1\n...\n\nLet's analyze the flagged cells. In row 2, (2,0) and (2,1) are F. Let's check if those could be mines. Let's look at (1,0)=2. (1,0) is a cell with 2 adjacent mines. Its neighbors are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F. So the neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). Wait, (1,0) is at row 1, column 0. The eight adjacent cells are:\n\n(0, -1) invalid, (0,0), (0,1),\n\n(1,-1) invalid, (1,0) itself, (1,1),\n\n(2,-1) invalid, (2,0), (2,1).\n\nSo valid neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). So (1,0)=2 means 2 mines in these 5 cells. (0,0) is 0 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe, since it's a number, not a mine), (1,1)=3 (safe, number). So the possible mines are (2,0) and (2,1). Since (1,0) has 2 mines, and (2,0) and (2,1) are flagged, that's 2 mines. So that matches. So those flags might be correct.\n\nNow row 1, column 2 is F (1,2). Let's check (1,1)=3. (1,1) is at row 1, column 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2),\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nSo 8 cells. (1,1)=3 means 3 mines here. Let's list them:\n\n(0,0)=0 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe),\n\n(1,0)=2 (safe), (1,2)=F (flagged, potential mine),\n\n(2,0)=F (flagged), (2,1)=F (flagged), (2,2)=2 (safe).\n\nSo the potential mines are (1,2), (2,0), (2,1). That's 3, which matches the 3 in (1,1). So that's good. So those three flags (2,0), (2,1), (1,2) might be correct. That's 3 flags, which matches the 'Flags: 3\/19' (maybe 3 correct, 19 attempted? Not sure, but let's proceed).\n\nNow, let's look at row 0, column 3: (0,3)=2. Let's find its adjacent cells. (0,3) is row 0, column 3. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,4),\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n\n(0,3) itself, so the 8 neighbors are:\n\n(0,2)=1 (safe), (0,4)=?,\n\n(1,2)=F (flagged, mine?), (1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=?,\n\n(-1,3) invalid, (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe).\n\nSo (0,3)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,2) (safe), (0,4), (1,2) (F), (1,3) (safe), (1,4), (2,2) (safe), (2,3) (safe). So the possible mines are (1,2) (F) and either (0,4) or (1,4). Since (1,2) is already flagged as a mine, that's 1 mine. So (0,3)=2 needs 1 more mine in (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nNext, (1,3)=2. Let's check (1,3). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nSo (1,3)=2 means 2 mines here. Known cells: (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=2 (safe), (1,2)=F (mine?), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe). So possible mines: (1,2) (F) and (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). If (1,2) is a mine (flagged), then (1,3) needs 1 more mine in (0,4), (1,4), (2,4).\n\nNow (2,3)=2. (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(2,3)=2 means 2 mines here. Known cells: (1,2)=F (mine?), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So possible mines: (1,2) (F), (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). If (1,2) is a mine, then (2,3) needs 1 more mine in those cells.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 1: (3,2)=1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3),\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\n(3,2)=1 means 1 mine here. Known cells: (2,1)=F (mine?), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,1)=3 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So if (2,1) is a mine (flagged), then (3,2) has 1 mine, which matches. That's good, so (2,1) being a mine is consistent.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 1: (3,3)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4),\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4).\n\n(3,3)=1 means 1 mine here. Known cells: (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So possible mines: (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Need 1 mine here.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is 3: (3,1)=3. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,1) is row 3, column 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2),\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),\n\n(4,0), (4,1), (4,2).\n\n(3,1)=3 means 3 mines here. Known cells: (2,0)=F (mine?), (2,1)=F (mine?), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So (2,0) and (2,1) are flagged, which are 2 mines. So (3,1) needs 1 more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). That's possible.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. The goal is to uncover safe cells to reveal more numbers, which can help find mines. Let's look at row 3, column 0: (3,0) is ?. Let's see if we can determine if it's safe. From (3,1)=3, which has 3 mines in its adjacent cells. We already have (2,0) and (2,1) as possible mines (flagged). If (2,0) and (2,1) are actual mines (since they are flagged and the numbers around them support that), then (3,1) needs 1 more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So (3,0) could be a mine or safe. Not sure yet.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 4 (0,4)? Let's see. (0,3)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. We have (1,2) as a flagged mine, so that's 1. So (0,4) or (1,4) could be the second mine. But (1,3)=2 also needs 2 mines, with (1,2) as 1, so (0,4), (1,4), (2,4) could have 1. If (0,4) is a mine, then (0,3)=2 is satisfied (1,2 and 0,4). Then (1,3)=2 would need 1 more mine in (1,4) or (2,4). But we don't have enough info.\n\nAnother area: row 3, column 4 (3,4) is ?. Let's check (2,3)=2. (2,3) has adjacent cells including (3,4). (3,3)=1 also has (3,4) as adjacent. If (3,4) is uncovered and is a number, it might help. Alternatively, maybe some cells are definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 0 is 0. The 0 cell means all adjacent cells are safe, and those cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are numbers, which are safe. The 0 cell's neighbors are all safe, and their neighbors might be safe if the numbers allow. For example, (0,1)=1: it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. We know (1,2) is flagged, (2,0), (2,1) are flagged. Let's see (0,1) adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. So (0,1)=1's adjacent cells are those 5 (since (0,1) is at edge). The 1 mine here is (1,2)=F, which is correct. So (0,1) is safe, and since it's a 1, and the mine is (1,2), then the other adjacent cells (0,2), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. (0,2)=1, which we can check: (0,2) has adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. So (0,2)=1 means 1 mine in those. (1,2)=F is the mine, so that's correct. So (0,2) is safe.\n\nNow, (0,3)=2: adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (mine) and maybe (1,3)=2. (1,3)=2's adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (mine) and (2,3)=2. (2,3)=2's adjacent cells include (1,2)=F (mine) and (3,3)=1. (3,3)=1's adjacent cells: maybe (3,4) is safe.\n\nWait, let's look at row 3, column 3 (3,3)=1. Its adjacent cells are (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. Since (3,3)=1, there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. If (2,4), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) are all safe, then (3,3)=1 would have 0 mines, which is wrong. So one of them is a mine. But we don't know which.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 0, column 4 (0,4) is ?, but maybe it's safe. Let's see (0,3)=2. The adjacent mines are (1,2) (F) and maybe (1,3)=2's adjacent. But (1,3)=2 has (1,2) (F) as 1 mine, so needs 1 more. If (1,3)=2's other mine is (2,4), then (0,3)=2's second mine would be (1,4). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 4 (3,4). Let's see if uncovering it is safe. If (3,4) is a number, it might help. Since the current board has many ? in row 3, column 4 is a good candidate. Let's check the numbers around (3,4):\n\n(2,3)=2: adjacent to (3,4)\n(3,3)=1: adjacent to (3,4)\n(3,4) is also adjacent to (2,4), (4,3), (4,4)\n\nIf (3,4) is uncovered and is a number, say 0, then all adjacent cells are safe. If it's 1, then one adjacent mine, etc. Since the user's score is 0.1578, which is 3\/19, maybe they have 3 correct flags (the ones we thought: (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)) and 16 incorrect flags. But the problem says \"Flags: 3\/19\" which might mean 3 flags placed, 19 is a typo. Anyway, the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 (3,4) is in the known area where (3,3)=1 and (2,3)=2. Let's assume that (3,4) is safe. Alternatively, maybe row 0, column 4 (0,4) is safe. But (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=2, which has 2 mines. If (1,2) is a mine, then (0,4) could be a mine or safe. But (1,3)=2 needs 2 mines, (1,2) is 1, so (1,3) needs 1 more. If (1,3)'s mine is (2,4), then (0,3)=2's second mine is (1,4), so (0,4) is safe. That's possible.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 4, column 0 (4,0) which is ?. But it's far from known numbers, so uncovering it might not help. The best bet is to uncover a cell adjacent to known numbers to get more info. Row 3, column 4 (3,4) is adjacent to (2,3)=2 and (3,3)=1, so uncovering it could reveal a number that helps. Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, I need to look at the current board and see what's known. The board is 9x9, but the given current board shows rows 0 to 13, which might be a typo—probably 0 to 8. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (Wait, 9x9 grid, so each row should have 9 cells. Maybe the display is cut off. Let's assume rows are 0-8, each with columns 0-8.)\n\nLet me correct the board structure. Maybe the user input has a formatting error, but let's parse the given rows as rows 0 to 8, each with columns 0-8. Let's list the visible cells properly:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [2, 3, F, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, F, 2, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, 3, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells and flags.\n\nFirst, flags (F) are at:\n- Row 1, column 2 (1,2)\n- Row 2, column 0 (2,0)\n- Row 2, column 1 (2,1)\nTotal flags: 3 (matches the \"Flags: 3\/19\" note, though 19 might be a typo, since total mines are 10. Maybe it's 3\/10? Or the 19 is a mistake.)\n\nThe score is 0.15789..., which is 3\/19, but that's probably incorrect. The actual score should be correct flags \/ 10. So maybe 3 correct flags so far.\n\nNow, let's check adjacent cells to known numbers to find safe cells or mines.\n\nStarting with row 0, column 0 (0,0) which is 0. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Let's check:\n\n(0,0) is 0. Adjacent cells:\n- (0,1) is 1 (already uncovered)\n- (1,0) is 2 (uncovered)\n- (1,1) is 3 (uncovered)\nSo no mines here, which is consistent.\n\nRow 0, column 1 (0,1) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in these adjacent cells. Since (1,2) is flagged (F), that's a possible mine. Let's check if that F is a correct mine. The 1 at (0,1) has adjacent cells. The count is 1, so if (1,2) is a mine, then that's the only one. That makes sense.\n\nRow 0, column 2 (0,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (1,2) is F, so that's a mine. So 1 mine here, which matches the 1. So (1,2) is likely a correct flag.\n\nRow 0, column 3 (0,3) is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2. The 2 here means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are F: (1,2) is F. So if (1,2) is a mine, then there's 1 mine, so another mine must be in adjacent cells. Let's check (2,2) which is 2. (2,2) is adjacent to (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=F, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1. The 2 at (2,2) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent F's are (2,1) and (1,2). So if both (2,1) and (1,2) are mines, that's 2, which matches the 2. So (2,1) is F, which is a mine, and (1,2) is F, a mine. So (2,1) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 2, column 0 (2,0) is F. Let's check adjacent cells. (2,0) is adjacent to (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=F, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=3. The cell (1,0) is 2, which is the count of mines in its adjacent cells. (1,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F. So (1,0) is 2, which would mean 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The F's here are (2,0) and (2,1). So if both are mines, that's 2, which matches the 2. So (2,0) is a correct flag.\n\nSo far, the three flags (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are correct (since they satisfy the adjacent numbers). So the score is 3\/10, which is 0.3, but the given score is 0.15789, which is 3\/19. Maybe the 19 is a mistake, but regardless, those three flags are correct.\n\nNow, let's look at row 3, column 1 (3,1) which is 3. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent F's are (2,0) and (2,1), which are 2 mines. So there must be 1 more mine in the remaining adjacent cells: (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But (2,2) is 2, which is a number, so it's not a mine. (3,2) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. So the remaining possible cells are (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So (3,0) could be a mine, but let's check other cells.\n\nRow 3, column 2 (3,2) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (2,1) is F (mine), so that's 1, which matches. So (3,2) is safe.\n\nRow 3, column 3 (3,3) is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (2,2) is 2 (not a mine), (2,3) is 2 (not a mine). So maybe one of the adjacent ? cells is a mine, but not sure yet.\n\nRow 3, column 4 (3,4) is 2. Let's look at this cell. The user's current board shows row 3 as [?, 3, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?]. So (3,4) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,4) is at row 3, column 4. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3)=2 (row 2, column 3), (2,4)=? (row 2, column 4), (2,5)=? (row 2, column 5)\n(3,3)=1 (row 3, column 3), (3,5)=? (row 3, column 5)\n(4,3)=? (row 4, column 3), (4,4)=? (row 4, column 4), (4,5)=? (row 4, column 5)\n\nThe cell (3,4) has a value of 2, meaning there are 2 mines in these 8 adjacent cells. Let's see if we can find safe cells here.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0 are safe. The cell (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe, but they are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 might be hidden, but we don't see any. Let's check row 0, column 0 is 0, which is the top-left. The next cell, row 0, column 1 is 1, row 0, column 2 is 1, row 0, column 3 is 2.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F. As we saw, (2,0) and (2,1) are mines (flags), so (1,0)=2 is correct (2 mines).\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 3. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2. The 3 here means 3 mines in adjacent cells. The F's are (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) → 3 mines. That matches the 3. So (1,1)=3 is correct, and those three flags are indeed mines. So that's 3 correct flags, which is 3\/10, so the score should be 0.3, but the given score is 0.15789, which is 3\/19. Maybe the 19 is a mistake, but the three flags are correct.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be uncovered safely. For example, in row 3, column 0 (3,0) is ?. Let's check the cell (3,1)=3. (3,1) has adjacent cells (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=F (mine), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1 (safe), (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The 3 at (3,1) requires 3 mines in adjacent cells. We already have 2 mines (the two F's), so there must be 1 more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But we can't be sure which one.\n\nAnother area: row 1, column 3 is 2. Let's check (1,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. We have (1,2)=F (mine) as one, so there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are numbers are (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=2 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=2 (safe). So the remaining cells are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=2. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (1,2)=F is a mine, so another mine is needed. Adjacent numbers: (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So the remaining cells: (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells again. (3,4)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=2 (safe), (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. The 2 here means 2 mines in these 8 cells. If (2,4) is a mine (from row 1, column 3's 2 needing one mine), and (2,5) is not, maybe (3,4) has 2 mines elsewhere. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a number that has all its mines already flagged, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at (1,1)=3. Its adjacent cells have 3 flags (F) at (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), which are all mines. So the other adjacent cells to (1,1) are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (2,2)=2. These are all uncovered and safe. So (1,1) is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (0,1)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (mine). The 1 here is satisfied because there's 1 mine (the F). So the other adjacent cells are safe, which they are (already uncovered).\n\nLooking at (0,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=2, (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2. The 1 here is satisfied by the 1 mine (F). So the other cells are safe, which they are.\n\nLooking at (1,0)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=F (mine). 2 mines here, which matches the 2. So (1,0) is satisfied.\n\nLooking at (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2, (2,1)=F (mine), (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1. The 2 here is satisfied by the two F mines (1,2) and (2,1). So (2,2) is satisfied.\n\nSo all the uncovered number cells so far are satisfied with the current flags. Now, we need to find a cell to uncover that is safe. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to numbers where the number of known mines is less than the number, but maybe we can find a safe cell.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 4 (3,4) which is 2. Let's see if we can find a safe cell around it. Alternatively, let's look at row 3, column 0 (3,0) which is ?. The cell (3,1)=3 has 2 known mines (flags), so there's 1 more mine in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). But we can't be sure.\n\nAnother area: row 0, column 4 is ?. Let's check (0,3)=2. (0,3) is 2, adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2. The 2 here means 2 mines in adjacent cells. We have 1 mine (F at (1,2)), so 1 more mine. The adjacent cells that are numbers: (0,2)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2 (all safe). So the remaining cells are (0,4), (1,4). So one of these is a mine. If (0,4) is uncovered and it's a number, that could help.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 4 (3,4). The cell (3,4) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cell (3,3)=1. (3,3)=1 has adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (2,2) and (2,3) are 2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So the mine must be in (2,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). If (3,4)=2, and (3,3)=1, maybe (3,4) has 2 mines, which could be (2,4) and (4,4), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is likely safe. For example, in row 3, column 4 (3,4) is 2. Let's see if uncovering (3,4) is safe. Wait, no, (3,4) is already uncovered (it's a 2). Oh, right, the current board shows row 3 as [?, 3, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?], so (3,4) is already uncovered (value 2). So the ? cells in row 3 are (3,0), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n\nLooking at row 3, column 0 (3,0): adjacent to (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=F (mine), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,1)=3 (safe), (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. The cell (3,0) is adjacent to (3,1)=3, which needs 3 mines. Since (2,0) and (2,1) are 2 mines, (3,0) could be the third mine, but we don't know. If (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1) is satisfied. If not, then the mine is in (4,0) or (4,1) or (4,2).\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, column 2 (4,2). Adjacent to (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,3)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?. (3,2)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which is (2,1)=F (mine). So (3,2) is satisfied. So (4,2) is adjacent to (3,2)=1, which is safe, so (4,2) might be safe.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find a cell that is adjacent to a 0, but there are no 0s except (0,0). All adjacent cells to (0,0) are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 could be in row 4, column 0, but we don't know. Alternatively, let's look for a cell that is surrounded by numbers that indicate it's safe.\n\nWait, let's check row 2, column 4 (2,4). It's a ?. Let's see its adjacent cells. (2,4) is adjacent to (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=2, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=2, (3,5)=?. (1,3)=2 has 1 mine needed (since (1,2)=F is 1 mine). (2,3)=2 has 1 mine needed (since (1,2)=F is 1 mine). So (2,4) could be a mine, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that is likely safe. For example, row 3, column 5 (3,5) is ?. Let's check (3,4)=2. (3,4)=2 has 8 adjacent cells, and if none of them are known mines, maybe (3,5) is safe. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the first uncovered cell in row 3, which is (3,0). Since (3,1)=3 needs 3 mines, and we have 2, maybe (3,0) is a mine. But if we flag it, but we don't know. But the user needs to uncover or flag. Since the game ends if you uncover a mine, we need to avoid that.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number that has all its mines accounted for, so the remaining cells are safe. For example, (2,3)=2. Its adjacent mines: (1,2)=F (mine). So 1 mine needed. If (2,4) is a mine, then (2,3)=2 is satisfied. But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 0, column 4 (0,4). It's a ?. Let's check (0,3)=2. (0,3)=2 has adjacent mines: (1,2)=F (mine). So 1 more mine. The adjacent cells are (0,4) and (1,4). If (0,4) is uncovered and it's a number, say 1, then (1,4) might be a mine. But we need to choose a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the first few rows have a lot of uncovered cells, and the lower rows (rows 4-8) are all ?. Maybe uncovering a cell in row 4, column 0 (4,0) could be safe. But without info, it's a guess.\n\nWait, let's look at row 3, column 0 (3,0). The cell (3,0) is ?, adjacent to (2,0)=F (mine), (2,1)=F (mine), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,1)=3 (safe), (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. The cell (3,1)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells. We have 2 mines (F's), so 1 more. If (3,0) is not a mine, then the mine must be in (4,0), (4,1), or (4,2). If (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1) is satisfied. But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 1, column 4 (1,4). It's a ?. Adjacent to (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?. (1,3)=2 has 1 mine needed (from (1,2)=F). So (1,4) could be that mine. But if we uncover (1,4) and it's a number, say 1, then we know more.\n\nBut maybe the best bet is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 1, which often has only one mine, so the other cells are safe. For example, row 3, column 3 (3,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The 1 here means 1 mine in these cells. (2,2) and (2,3) are 2 (safe), (3,2)=1 (safe). So the mine is in (2,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So the other cells (like (4,3)) could be safe. Let's pick (4,3) to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 4 (3,4)=2. Adjacent to (3,3)=1, which has 1 mine. So (3,4)=2 might have 2 mines, which could be (2,4) and (4,4). But if we uncover (4,3), which is adjacent to (3,3)=1, it might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the first ? in row 3, which is (3,0). If we uncover (3,0), if it's a number, we can get more info. If it's a mine, the game ends, but the score is 3\/10, which is 0.3, better than the current 0.15789. But the user probably wants to avoid losing.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the win condition: uncover all safe cells or flag all mines. There are 10 mines. 3 are flagged correctly. So 7 mines left. To win by uncovering all safe cells, we need to uncover 81-10=71 cells. The current board has some uncovered cells. Let's count the uncovered cells:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-3 are uncovered (4 cells)\nRow 1: columns 0-3 are uncovered (4 cells), column 2 is F (flagged)\nRow 2: columns 0-3 are uncovered (4 cells), columns 0-1 are F (flagged)\nRow 3: columns 1-4 are uncovered (4 cells)\nTotal uncovered cells: 4 (row0) + 4 (row1) + 4 (row2) + 4 (row3) = 16. Plus the flags: 3 flags. So total processed cells: 16 + 3 = 19. Which matches the \"Flags: 3\/19\" note. So 19 cells processed, 81-19=62 cells left. To win by uncovering, need to uncover 71-16=55 more cells. But that's a lot.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (0,4). Let's check (0,3)=2. (0,3) has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F (mine), (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2. The 2 here means 2 mines. We have 1 mine (F), so 1 more. The possible cells are (0,4) and (1,4). So if we uncover (0,4) and it's a number, say 0, then we know (1,4) is the mine. If it's 1, then (1,4) is safe. Let's try (0,4).\n\nBut wait, the current board shows row 0 as \"0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which is 13 characters, but it's a 9x9 grid, so probably a formatting error. Let's assume row 0 has columns 0-8, so the first four are 0,1,1,2, then columns 4-8 are ?. So (0,4) is the first ? in row 0.\n\nUncovering (0,4) might be a good move. Alternatively, let's check (1,4). But (1,4) is adjacent to (1,3)=2, which needs 1 mine. If (1,4) is a mine, then (1,3)=2 is satisfied. If not, then (0,4) is the mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 4 (2,4). Adjacent to (2,3)=2, which needs 1 mine. If (2,4) is a mine, then (2,3)=2 is satisfied.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell in the first row of ?s, like (0,4). Let's go with (0,4).\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. The cell (3,4) is 2. Its adjacent cells include (3,3)=1. (3,3)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If (3,4)=2, then maybe (3,3) has a mine adjacent to (3,4). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 5 (3,5). It's a ?. Adjacent to (3,4)=2. If (3,5) is uncovered, and it's a number, we can get info. But again, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the initial moves. The user has 3 correct flags. To maximize the score, they need to flag more mines. But to flag, they need to be sure. Since we can't be sure, maybe uncovering a safe cell is better.\n\nAnother approach: look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has only one ? cell, meaning that ? is a mine. For example, (3,2)=1. Its adjacent cells are (2,1)=F (mine), (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. The 1 here is satisfied by (2,1)=F, so the other adjacent cells are safe. So (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are safe. So uncovering (4,1), (4,2), or (4,3) is safe.\n\nYes! (3,2)=1 has a value of 1, which means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. We already have (2,1)=F (mine) as that mine. Therefore, all other adjacent cells to (3,2) are safe. The adjacent cells to (3,2) are:\n\n(2,1)=F (mine)\n(2,2)=2 (safe)\n(2,3)=2 (safe)\n(3,1)=3 (safe)\n(3,3)=1 (safe)\n(4,1)=? (safe)\n(4,2)=? (safe)\n(4,3)=? (safe)\n\nSo (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) are all safe cells. Uncovering any of them is safe. Let's pick one, say (4,3).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because (3,2)=1 has exactly one mine (the flagged (2,1)), so all other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (4,3) is safe to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,3)","uncover (4,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed here might be a formatting issue—maybe each line is a row, but there are 14 rows listed, which is confusing. Wait, the Minesweeper board is supposed to be 9x9, so maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps the numbers after each row are the columns. Let's assume the first row is row 0, columns 0-8. Let's parse the current board correctly.\n\nCurrent Board (assuming 9 rows, each with 9 cells, maybe the user listed them with some typos):\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 1: 2 3 F 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 2: F F 2 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRow 3: ? 3 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? \nRow 4: ? ? ? 2 ? ? ? ? ? \nRows 5-8: All ? (since the user listed more rows, but it's 9x9, so rows 5-8 are all ?)\n\nWait, the user's current board shows 14 rows, which is incorrect. Maybe it's a copy-paste error. Let's focus on the first 9 rows, assuming each has 9 cells. Let's correct that. Let's list the board properly as 9 rows, 9 columns each.\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 1: [2, 3, F, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [F, F, 2, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, 3, 1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 4: [?, ?, ?, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 5-8: All ? in all columns.\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nFirst, row 0, column 0 is 0. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Let's check their values. (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is 2. Let's look at (0,3). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\n(0,2) is 1 (from row 0: [0,1,1,2,...] so (0,2) is 1), (0,3) is 2. (1,2) is F (flagged), (1,3) is 2. So (0,3)=2. The adjacent cells that are flagged: (1,2) is F. So the 2 here could be accounting for that F (if it's a correct flag) plus another mine. Let's check row 1, column 2 is F. Let's see if that F is a correct mine.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 3. (1,1) is 3. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\n(0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=2, (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2.\n\nSo (1,1)=3. The number 3 means there are 3 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are flagged are (1,2)=F, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F. That's 3 flags. So if those 3 flags are correct, then (1,1)=3 is satisfied. That suggests that the F's at (1,2), (2,0), (2,1) are indeed mines. That's a good sign—those flags are probably correct.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is F, row 2, column 1 is F. Let's check (2,0)=F. Its adjacent cells: (1,0)=2, (1,1)=3, (2,1)=F, (3,0)=? (row 3, column 0 is ?). (1,0)=2: adjacent cells to (1,0) are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (3,0)=?.\n\nSo (1,0)=2. The adjacent cells with flags are (2,0)=F and (2,1)=F. So that's 2 flags, which matches the 2 in (1,0). So that's correct. Therefore, (2,0) and (2,1) are mines. That's confirmed by (1,0)=2 and (1,1)=3. So those flags are correct.\n\nRow 2, column 2 is 2. (2,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=3, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=F, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1.\n\nSo (2,2)=2. The adjacent cells that are flagged are (1,2)=F and (2,1)=F. That's 2 flags, which matches the 2. So (1,2)=F is also a correct mine. So the three F's in row 1 col 2, row 2 col 0, row 2 col 1 are all correct mines. Good.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is 3. (3,1)=3. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?.\n\nSo (3,1)=3. The adjacent flagged cells are (2,0)=F and (2,1)=F (2 mines). So there must be 1 more mine in the adjacent unknown cells. The adjacent unknown cells to (3,1) are (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 1. (3,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=F, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (3,1)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?.\n\n(3,2)=1. The adjacent flagged cell is (2,1)=F (1 mine). So that's exactly 1, which matches. So (3,2)=1 is satisfied by the F at (2,1). So no additional mines needed here.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 1. (3,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?.\n\n(3,3)=1. Let's see adjacent known cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2. So (2,3)=2. Let's check (2,3)=2. (2,3) is row 2, column 3, value 2. Adjacent cells to (2,3): (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=2.\n\n(2,3)=2. The adjacent flagged cell is (1,2)=F (1 mine). So there must be 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent unknown cells here are (1,4), (2,4), (3,4). So one of these is a mine.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 2. (3,4)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?.\n\nSo (3,4)=2. Let's see. From (2,3)=2, which needs 1 more mine (since (1,2)=F is one), and (3,4)=2. If (2,4) is a mine, then (2,3)=2 would have (1,2)=F and (2,4)=mine (total 2), which matches. Then (3,4)=2 would have (2,4)=mine as adjacent, so it needs one more mine. Alternatively, (1,4) could be a mine. Let's check (1,3)=2. (1,3) is row 1, column 3, value 2. Adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?.\n\n(1,3)=2. The adjacent flagged cell is (1,2)=F (1 mine). So (1,3)=2 needs one more mine. The adjacent unknown cells are (0,4), (1,4), (2,4). So (1,3)=2 has 1 mine (F) and needs 1 more. (2,3)=2 also has 1 mine (F) and needs 1 more. So the possible overlapping is (2,4). If (2,4) is a mine, then (1,3)=2 would have (1,2)=F and (2,4)=mine (total 2), which matches. (2,3)=2 would have (1,2)=F and (2,4)=mine (total 2), which matches. Then (3,4)=2 would have (2,4)=mine (1) and needs 1 more. So (3,4) adjacent cells: (2,4)=mine, and maybe (3,5) or (4,4), etc. But this is getting a bit complicated.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check row 0, column 4. (0,4) is '?'. Let's see adjacent cells to (0,4). The known cells around (0,4) are (0,3)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?.\n\n(0,3)=2: adjacent cells include (0,4). So (0,3)=2 has some mines around. We know (0,3) is 2, and its adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=F, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=?.\n\nFrom (0,3)=2, the adjacent mines are (1,2)=F (1 mine) and one more. That could be (0,4) or (1,4). But (1,3)=2: adjacent mines are (1,2)=F (1) and one more, which could be (0,4) or (1,4) or (2,4). If (0,4) is a mine, then (0,3)=2 would have (1,2)=F and (0,4)=mine (total 2). Then (1,3)=2 would have (1,2)=F and (0,4)=mine (total 2). That works. So (0,4) could be a mine, but we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 3, column 0. (3,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (3,1)=3, (4,0)=?.\n\n(3,1)=3 has adjacent mines: (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F (2 mines) and needs 1 more. So the third mine is in (3,0), (4,0), (4,1), or (4,2). If (3,0) is safe, then the mine is in (4,0), (4,1), or (4,2). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 0 is 0, which means all adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is 2, (1,1) is 3—all numbers, so they are safe (since they are uncovered and not mines). So that's correct.\n\nLooking for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check row 3, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?.\n\n(3,3)=1: since (3,2)=1 is adjacent, which is a number, not a mine. (2,2)=2 is a number, (2,3)=2 is a number. So the 1 in (3,3) must come from one mine in its adjacent cells. Which adjacent cells could that be? Let's see (2,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (3,4). But maybe (2,4) is a mine (as we thought earlier). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 4, column 3. (4,3) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (3,2)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,4)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=?, (5,4)=?.\n\n(3,3)=1: adjacent to (4,3). If (3,3)=1 has one mine, and (3,2)=1 has one mine (which is (2,1)=F), then (4,3) might be safe. But not sure.\n\nWait, let's look at row 0, column 4. Let's see if uncovering it is safe. If (0,4) is a mine, then uncovering it would lose. But maybe it's safe. Alternatively, let's look for a cell that has a 0 adjacent, which would mean all adjacent cells are safe. The only 0 is at (0,0). Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), which are all uncovered. So no other 0s.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are surrounded by numbers which have already accounted for all their mines, meaning the remaining adjacent ? are safe.\n\nFor example, row 2, column 0 is F (mine), row 2, column 1 is F (mine). (1,0)=2, which is adjacent to (2,0) and (2,1) (two mines), so (1,0) has all mines accounted for. Therefore, the other adjacent cells to (1,0) must be safe. (1,0) is at (1,0), adjacent cells are (0,0)=0, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=3, (2,0)=F, (2,1)=F, (3,0)=?.\n\nSince (1,0)=2, and the two mines are (2,0) and (2,1), the remaining adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (3,0) must be safe (since 2 mines are already counted). (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) are already uncovered, so (3,0) must be safe! Because (1,0) has exactly 2 mines (the two Fs), so (3,0) is safe. That's a key insight.\n\nYes! (1,0) has value 2, which means exactly 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0) (0, safe), (0,1) (1, safe), (1,1) (3, safe), (2,0) (F, mine), (2,1) (F, mine), (3,0) (unknown). Since there are already 2 mines (the two Fs), (3,0) cannot be a mine. Therefore, (3,0) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover (3,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)"],"unflags":0,"seed":4,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

The board is 9x9, but the current board displayed here seems to have 17 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Oh, right, the user probably made a typo. The actual Minesweeper is 9x9, so the rows are 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines. The initial board is all '?', so no information yet. The first move in Minesweeper is usually safe, so I should pick a starting cell. Common starting points are the corners or edges, but any cell is fine since there's no info. Let's choose (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but maybe (4,4) to be in the middle? No, first move is random. Let's go with (0,0). So the action is to uncover (0,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The visible cells are in the top-left corner. Let's parse the rows given. The user mentioned it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board display shows 17 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Let me check again. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8. The current board listed has rows from 0 to 16, which is probably a mistake. Let's assume the first 9 rows are the actual board. Let's correct that.\n\nSo the first three rows (0, 1, 2) have some uncovered cells. Let's list them properly:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRows 3-8: all ?\n\nNow, let's analyze the known cells. The numbers represent the number of adjacent mines. Let's check the cells in row 0, columns 0,1,2: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2. Similarly, row 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2. Row 2: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2.\n\nFirst, a cell with 0 means none of its 8 adjacent cells have mines. So let's check (0,0)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) and (1,0) are already uncovered and also 0, which makes sense. The 0 at (0,0) tells us that (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. Which they are, since they are uncovered and 0.\n\nNow (0,2)=2. Let's find its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,2) are: (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0 (safe), (1,1) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 2 (uncovered). So the remaining adjacent cells are (0,3) and (1,3). So (0,2) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which must be (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Uncovered cells here: (0,1)=0 (safe), (0,2)=2 (uncovered), (1,1)=0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (uncovered), (2,2)=2 (uncovered). So the adjacent unknown cells are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). Since (1,2) has 2 mines, and from (0,2)=2 we already deduced (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, that would be 2 mines, so (2,3) must be safe.\n\nLet's check (2,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Uncovered cells: (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (uncovered), (2,1)=1 (uncovered). So unknown cells: (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Since (1,3) is a mine (from (0,2)=2), that's 1 mine. So there's 1 more mine in the remaining cells: (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nNow (2,0)=1. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (uncovered). So the adjacent unknown cells are (3,0) and (3,1). So (2,0)=1 means exactly 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1).\n\n(2,1)=1. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). Uncovered: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2. So unknown cells: (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (2,1)=1 means 1 mine in these three. From (2,0)=1, we know 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1). So if (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1) is safe, and (2,1) would have (3,0) as the mine, so (3,2) is safe. If (3,1) is a mine, then (3,0) is safe, and (2,1) has (3,1) as the mine, so (3,2) is safe. Either way, (3,2) is safe.\n\nSo (3,2) is safe. That's a good candidate to uncover. Let's confirm. (3,2) is in row 3, column 2. Let's check if that's correct.\n\nFrom (2,1)=1: adjacent cells (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). If (3,0) is mine, then (3,1) and (3,2) are safe. If (3,1) is mine, then (3,0) and (3,2) are safe. So (3,2) can't be a mine. Therefore, uncovering (3,2) is safe. That's a good move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,2)","uncover (3,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current board. The user provided a partial board where some cells are uncovered with numbers, and the rest are unknown (marked as ?). The coordinates are (row, col), with the top-left being (0,0). \n\nLooking at the current board, the first three rows have some numbers. Let's list out the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, then all ? from (0,3) to (0,16)\nRow 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, then ?\nRow 2: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, then ?\nRow 3: (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, then ?\nRows 4-16: all ?\n\nFirst, let's recall that a 0 means none of the 8 adjacent cells have mines. So, for (0,0)=0, the adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) and (1,0) are already 0, so that checks out. Similarly, (1,0)=0's adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), which are all 0 or 1, so no mines there. \n\n(0,2)=2: this cell has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0, (1,1) is 0, so those are safe. So the 2 mines must be in (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). \n\n(1,2)=2: adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2. So the 2 mines here must be in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). \n\n(2,2)=2: adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,2)=2. So the 2 mines here are in (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). \n\nAlso, (2,0)=1: adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1. So the 1 mine here must be in (3,0) or (3,1). \n\n(2,1)=1: adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,2)=2. So the 1 mine here is in (3,0) or (3,1). Which matches the (2,0)=1 clue, so either (3,0) or (3,1) is a mine, but not both.\n\nNow, let's look at (3,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, so the 2 mines here could be in (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nBut let's try to find a safe cell to uncover. The safest cells are those adjacent to 0s, because 0s mean all adjacent are safe. Let's check the 0 cells:\n\n(0,0)=0: adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are already uncovered, so no new info.\n(0,1)=0: adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are uncovered, so no new safe cells here.\n(1,0)=0: adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All uncovered except maybe (2,0) and (2,1), but they are 1 and 1, so no.\n(1,1)=0: adjacent cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). All these are uncovered, so no new safe cells.\n\nSo the 0s don't give us new safe cells. Next, look for cells that are adjacent to numbers and see if we can find safe cells.\n\nLooking at (0,2)=2 and (1,2)=2. Let's denote A=(0,3), B=(1,3), C=(2,3). \n\nFrom (0,2)=2: A + B + (1,3's adjacent) = 2. Wait, (0,2) has adjacent cells (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2. So the 2 mines must be in (0,3) or (1,3). Because (0,2) has 8 adjacent cells: (0-1,2-1) to (0+1,2+1), but (0-1,2-1) is out of bounds (row -1), so the valid adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). So 5 cells, 2 mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) could be the mines, but maybe (0,3) and (1,2) but (1,2) is 2, which is a number, not a mine. Wait, (1,2) is an uncovered cell with value 2, so it's a safe cell (mines are hidden, so uncovered cells are safe). So (1,2) is safe, so (0,2)'s adjacent mines are in (0,3), (1,3). So 2 mines in those two cells. So (0,3) and (1,3) must both be mines? Because 2 mines in 2 cells. Oh, that's a key point! If a cell has a number equal to the number of adjacent unknown cells, then those unknown cells must be mines.\n\n(0,2)=2. Its adjacent unknown cells are (0,3) and (1,3) (since (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) are uncovered and safe). So there are 2 unknown cells adjacent to (0,2), and the number is 2, so both (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. That's a deduction!\n\nLet me confirm: (0,2) is at (0,2). Adjacent cells are:\n\n- (0,1): 0 (safe)\n- (0,3): ? (unknown)\n- (1,1): 0 (safe)\n- (1,2): 2 (safe, since it's uncovered)\n- (1,3): ? (unknown)\n\nSo that's 5 adjacent cells, 3 are safe (0,1; 1,1; 1,2), 2 are unknown (0,3; 1,3). The number is 2, so those 2 unknowns must be mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Therefore, we should flag them. But the current action is to choose an action. However, maybe we can uncover a cell that's safe.\n\nNow, let's check (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=0 (safe), (0,2)=2 (safe), (0,3)=mine (from above), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,3)=mine (from above), (2,1)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=? (unknown). \n\nSo (1,2)=2 has adjacent mines: (0,3) and (1,3) (which are 2 mines), so that's correct. So (1,2)=2 is satisfied.\n\nNow, (2,2)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=mine (from above), (2,1)=1 (safe), (2,3)=? (unknown), (3,1)=? (unknown), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=? (unknown).\n\nSo (2,2)=2 has 1 mine already (1,3). So there's 1 more mine in (2,3), (3,1), (3,3).\n\n(2,0)=1: adjacent cells (1,0)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (safe), (3,0)=? (unknown), (3,1)=? (unknown). So 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1).\n\n(2,1)=1: adjacent cells (1,0)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (2,0)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (3,0)=? (unknown), (3,1)=? (unknown), (3,2)=2 (safe). So 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1), same as (2,0)=1. So exactly one of (3,0) or (3,1) is a mine.\n\nNow, (3,2)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(2,1)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=? (unknown), (3,1)=? (unknown), (3,3)=? (unknown), (4,1)=? (unknown), (4,2)=? (unknown), (4,3)=? (unknown).\n\nWe know from (2,2)=2 that there's 1 mine in (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). So (3,2)=2's adjacent mines could be those plus others.\n\nBut let's look for a safe cell to uncover. Since (0,3) and (1,3) are mines (as deduced), their adjacent cells might have clues. Let's check (0,4), which is adjacent to (0,3). (0,3) is a mine, so (0,4) is adjacent to a mine. But (0,4) is unknown. What about (1,4)? Adjacent to (1,3) (mine), so also adjacent to a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the 0 cells again. The 0s are (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Their adjacent cells are all uncovered, so no new safe cells from them. \n\nAnother approach: cells that are definitely safe. For example, (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3) (mine) and (0,2)=2. (0,2) has 2 mines, which we've already accounted for in (0,3) and (1,3). So (0,4) is not adjacent to (0,2), so (0,4) is in row 0, column 4. (0,2) is column 2, so (0,4) is two columns to the right. The adjacent cells of (0,4) would be (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). We know (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, so (0,4) has at least 2 adjacent mines, but we don't know if that's all.\n\nWait, maybe there's a cell that's safe because all adjacent mines are already accounted for. Let's take (2,3). From (1,2)=2, we know (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, so (1,2)=2 is satisfied. (2,2)=2 has (1,3) as a mine, so needs one more mine in (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). If we can find a cell where the number of adjacent mines is known, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 0: (3,0). It's adjacent to (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1. (2,0)=1 has one mine in (3,0) or (3,1). (2,1)=1 also has one mine in (3,0) or (3,1). So if (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1) is safe, and vice versa. So (3,0) and (3,1) are mutually exclusive. So if we uncover (3,0), if it's a mine, we lose. If it's safe, then (3,1) must be the mine. But that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's far from the known numbers, but since the board is 9x9 but the current board shows up to row 16? Wait, the user's current board might have a formatting error. Wait, the initial description says the board is 9x9, but the current board shows 17 rows (0-16) and 17 columns (0-16)? That's probably a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's assume that. So the current board display might have a formatting error, showing more rows and columns than actual. So focusing on rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nAssuming that, the visible cells are:\n\nRow 0: columns 0-2 are 0,0,2; columns 3-8 are ?\nRow 1: columns 0-2 are 0,0,2; columns 3-8 are ?\nRow 2: columns 0-2 are 1,1,2; columns 3-8 are ?\nRow 3: columns 0-1 are ?, column 2 is 2; columns 3-8 are ?\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nSo (0,3) is column 3, row 0; (1,3) is row 1, column 3.\n\nEarlier deduction: (0,2)=2 has adjacent cells (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?. Since (0,2)=2, and the adjacent safe cells are (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), the remaining two cells (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines (because 2 mines needed). So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Therefore, any cell adjacent to these mines but not already a mine would have their counts affected.\n\nNow, let's check (2,3). It's adjacent to (1,3) (mine), (1,2)=2, (2,2)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=?, (1,4)=?, (2,4)=?, (3,4)=?. So (2,3) is adjacent to one known mine (1,3). If (2,3) is uncovered, its number would indicate how many mines are in its adjacent cells. But maybe we can find a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (0,4). It's adjacent to (0,3) (mine) and (1,3) (mine). So (0,4) has at least two adjacent mines. But if (0,4) is uncovered, it might show 2, but that's not helpful.\n\nWhat about (2,0)? It's 1, which we already considered. (2,1) is 1. (3,2) is 2.\n\nAnother angle: the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, but since all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered, the next best is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a low number (like 1 or 2) where we can deduce safety.\n\nWait, let's consider (2,3). If (1,3) is a mine (as we deduced), then (2,3) is adjacent to that mine. The cell (2,2)=2 has adjacent mines: (1,3) and one more in (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). So if (2,3) is a mine, then (2,2)=2's mine count is satisfied (1,3 and 2,3). If (2,3) is safe, then the mine must be in (3,1) or (3,3).\n\nBut we need to find a cell that's safe. Let's think about (3,0). If (3,0) is safe, then (3,1) must be the mine (from (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1). If (3,0) is a mine, then (3,1) is safe. So either way, one of them is a mine, the other is safe. But we don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (0,4). Since (0,3) is a mine, (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3). The cell (0,4) is also adjacent to (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (1,3) is a mine, so (0,4) has at least two mines adjacent. If we uncover (0,4), it might show 2, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe (2,3) is a good candidate. Let's see: (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3) (mine). If (2,3) is uncovered and shows 1, then it means only (1,3) is a mine around it, so the other adjacent cells (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (1,4) are safe. If it shows 2, then there's another mine in those adjacent cells. But without more info, maybe it's better to choose a cell that's in a less risky area.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the upper right area. The cells in row 0, column 4 and beyond are all unknown. Since the 0s are in the top-left, maybe the mines are concentrated in the top-middle, and the top-right could be safe. For example, (0,4) is adjacent to two mines (0,3 and 1,3), but (0,5) is adjacent to (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). If (0,5) is uncovered, it might be a 0, which would reveal more safe cells.\n\nBut wait, the initial board has 10 mines. We deduced two mines at (0,3) and (1,3). So there are 8 left. The user's current flags are 0\/29, which might be a typo (since there are 10 mines, it should be 0\/10). Maybe the \"Flags: 0\/29\" is a mistake, and it's 0\/10.\n\nAssuming we need to uncover a safe cell, and given that the top-left has 0s which have already revealed their adjacent cells, the next area to explore is the cells adjacent to the 2s. Let's pick (3,3). Wait, (3,3) is adjacent to (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (3,2)=2, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, so their adjacent cells (0,4), (1,4), (2,3) are adjacent to at least one mine. But maybe (2,4) is a good candidate. (2,4) is adjacent to (1,3)=mine, (1,4)=?, (1,5)=?, (2,3)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=?, (3,4)=?, (3,5)=?. If (2,4) is uncovered, it might show a number that helps, but it's a risk.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is in a corner or edge, which often have fewer adjacent cells. The top-left corner is already uncovered. The top-right corner (0,8) is unknown. Uncovering (0,8) might be safe if there are no mines there. Since the known mines are in (0,3) and (1,3), (0,8) is far away, so maybe it's safe.\n\nBut the best strategy in Minesweeper is to uncover cells adjacent to known numbers where you can deduce safety. Since we deduced that (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, let's check the cell (2,3). (2,3) is adjacent to (1,3)=mine, so if (2,3) is uncovered and shows 1, then we know no other mines are around it. If it shows 2, there's another mine nearby. But without knowing, maybe it's better to pick a cell that's not adjacent to known mines.\n\nWait, (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=mine, so it's adjacent to a mine. (0,5) is adjacent to (0,4) and (1,4), which are unknown. Maybe (0,5) is a good candidate. Alternatively, (4,4), which is in the middle of the board and far from known numbers, might be safe.\n\nBut given that the game ends at the 100th epoch, and we need to maximize the score, the best first move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. In the initial moves, the corners and edges are often safe, but the top-left is already uncovered. So maybe (3,4) is a good choice, as it's in row 3, column 4, which is in the middle of the unknown area. Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's look at the current board. The visible cells are in the top-left area. Let's list out the coordinates and their values:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, then all ? from (0,3) onwards.\nRow 1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, then ?.\nRow 2: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, then ?.\nRow 3: (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1, then ?.\n\nSo, let's analyze the known numbers. Let's start with the 0s because they indicate no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered.\n\nFirst, (0,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But those are already uncovered (they are 0, 0, 0), so nothing new there.\n\n(0,1) is 0. Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (0,0) and (1,0), (1,1) are 0, (0,2) is 2, (1,2) is 2. So no new info here.\n\n(1,0) is 0. Adjacent cells same as above, already uncovered.\n\n(1,1) is 0. Same as above.\n\n(2,0) is 1. Adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. The 1 at (2,0) means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (3,0) and (3,1). But (2,1) is 1, let's check (2,1).\n\n(2,1) is 1. Adjacent cells: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. So (2,1) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cells here are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2) is 2 (already uncovered). Wait, (3,2) is 2, which is a number, so it's uncovered. So (2,1)'s adjacent unknowns are (3,0) and (3,1). Since (2,1) is 1, and (2,0) is 1, maybe (3,0) and (3,1) have one mine between them. Let's check (2,2) which is 2.\n\n(2,2) is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=?. The known cells here are (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (3,2)=2. The unknowns are (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). The 2 here means there are 2 mines in these adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at row 3, (3,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. So (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in those adjacent cells.\n\nAlso, (3,4)=1. Let's check (3,4). Its adjacent cells are (2,3)=?, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=?, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. So (3,4)=1 means there's 1 mine in these 8 cells.\n\nHmm. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, 0 cells can help. But all the 0s are in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Their adjacent cells are already uncovered. So maybe look at cells adjacent to 1s that have limited possibilities.\n\nLet's check (0,2)=2. (0,2) is at (row 0, column 2). Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?. So (0,2) has 2 mines. The adjacent cells here are (0,3) and (1,3), since (0,1) and (1,1) are 0, (1,2) is 2 (uncovered). So (0,2)=2 means that (0,3) and (1,3) must contain exactly 2 mines. Because those are the only two unknown adjacent cells. So (0,3) and (1,3) are both mines. That's a key insight! Because (0,2) has 2 adjacent mines, and the only possible cells are (0,3) and (1,3). So those two must be mines. So we should flag them. But wait, let's confirm.\n\n(0,2) is at (0,2). The eight adjacent cells are:\n\n(0-1,2-1) invalid (row -1), (0-1,2) invalid, (0-1,2+1) invalid,\n\n(0,2-1) = (0,1) = 0,\n\n(0,2+1) = (0,3) = ?,\n\n(0+1,2-1) = (1,1) = 0,\n\n(0+1,2) = (1,2) = 2,\n\n(0+1,2+1) = (1,3) = ?.\n\nSo yes, only (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent and unknown. So (0,2)=2 requires exactly 2 mines in those two cells. Therefore, both (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. So we should flag them. But wait, the current board shows (0,3) as ?, so we can flag (0,3) and (1,3).\n\nBut let's check another cell to confirm. (1,2)=2. (1,2) is at (1,2). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?,\n\n(1,1)=0, (1,3)=?,\n\n(2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=?.\n\nSo the adjacent unknown cells are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. From (0,2)=2, we know (0,3) and (1,3) are 2 mines, which would mean (1,2)=2's adjacent mines would be (0,3) and (1,3), which are 2 mines. So that's correct. Then (2,3) must be safe, because (1,2)=2 already has its 2 mines from (0,3) and (1,3). So (2,3) is safe. So we can uncover (2,3).\n\nLet's confirm that. (1,2)=2 has adjacent cells: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). If (0,3) and (1,3) are mines (2 mines), then (2,3) must be safe. So (2,3) is a safe cell that can be uncovered. That's a good move.\n\nAnother check: (2,2)=2. (2,2) is at (2,2). Adjacent cells include (1,3)=? (which we think is a mine), (2,3)=? (which we think is safe), (3,3)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,2)=2, (1,1)=0, (3,1)=?.\n\nIf (1,3) is a mine, then (2,2)=2 has one mine from (1,3). The other mine could be in (3,3) or (3,1), but maybe we can't confirm that yet.\n\nBut let's focus on the safe cell we found: (2,3). Since (1,2)=2's adjacent mines are (0,3) and (1,3), then (2,3) is safe. So uncovering (2,3) is a safe move. Let's check the coordinates. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0-16? Wait, the user probably made a mistake in the board display. Wait, the problem says the board is 9x9 grid. So rows 0-8, columns 0-8. But the current board in the input shows rows 0 to 16, which is a mistake. Probably, the user intended to list the 9 rows, but maybe there's a formatting error. Let's assume the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nLooking back at the input's Current Board:\n\nThe first line is \"0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which has 17 elements, which is wrong. Probably, it's a formatting error, and each row should have 9 elements. Let's correct that. The user probably meant:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] (9 cells)\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 2: [1, 1, 2, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 2, ?, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all ?s.\n\nThat makes sense for a 9x9 grid. So (0,3) is column 3 of row 0, which is within 0-8.\n\nSo, (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Let's confirm that (2,3) is adjacent to (1,2)=2. (1,2) is row 1, column 2. (2,3) is row 2, column 3: yes, that's diagonally adjacent (down-right), so it's in the 8 adjacent cells of (1,2). So (1,2)=2's adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). Of these, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2 are known. The unknowns are (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). Since (0,2)=2's adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?. So (0,2) has two adjacent unknowns, (0,3) and (1,3), and needs 2 mines. Therefore, both must be mines. Then (1,2)=2 has two mines in (0,3) and (1,3), so (2,3) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (2,3) is safe.\n\nSo the action should be to uncover (2,3). Let's check the coordinates: row 2, column 3. So the command is 'uncover (2,3)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,3)","uncover (2,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current board and see what's uncovered. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows rows 0 to 16? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Oh, the user probably meant the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Let me check the input again. The current board has rows 0 to 16, but that's probably a mistake. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? (assuming columns 0-8, so 9 cells)\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 2: 1 1 2 1 ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 ? 1 ? ? ? ?\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nSo let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's list the known cells:\n\nRow 0, columns 0: 0, 1:0, 2:2\nRow 1, columns 0:0, 1:0, 2:2\nRow 2, columns 0:1, 1:1, 2:2, 3:1\nRow 3, column 2:2, column 4:1\n\nNow, let's analyze these numbers. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. So, for example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, these adjacent cells must be safe (no mines). Similarly, row 0, column 1 is 0, so its adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2) are all safe. But (0,0) and (1,0), (1,1) are already known, so (0,2) and (1,2) are part of the 0's adjacent cells. Wait, row 0, column 2 is 2. So (0,2) is a number, meaning it has 2 mines around it. Let's check (0,2)'s adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0 (safe), (1,1) is 0 (safe), so the 2 mines must be in (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). But row 1, column 2 is 2 (from row 1: 0 0 2). So (1,2) is 2. Let's check (1,2)'s adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So the 2 mines for (1,2) must be in the remaining adjacent cells: (0,3), (1,3), (2,3). Let's see row 2, column 2 is 2. Its adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,2)=2 (row 3, column 2 is 2). So (2,2) has 2 mines, so in its adjacent cells, two are mines. The known cells here are (1,1)=0 (safe), (2,1)=1 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe). So the possible mines are (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). \n\nRow 2, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (2,2), (2,4), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4). (1,2)=2, (2,2)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=1 (row 3, column 4 is 1). So (2,3) is 1, meaning one mine in its adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells here: (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3), (3,4). (3,4) is 1, which is a number, so safe. So the mine for (2,3) could be in (1,3), (1,4), (2,4), (3,3).\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, so those are safe. So the 2 mines here are in (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, which is safe. So (3,4) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, so (0,1) is 0, which is also 0, so their adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (1,0): it's 0. So (1,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1. All safe, so (1,0) being 0 confirms that (2,0) and (2,1) are safe (they are numbers, which are safe). So (2,0) is 1, (2,1) is 1. \n\nLooking at (2,0) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,1)=1. So (2,0)=1 means there's 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1). \n\nRow 3, column 0 is ?, row 3, column 1 is ?. So (3,0) and (3,1) are unknown. Since (2,0) is 1, one of these two is a mine.\n\nRow 2, column 1 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,2)=2. So (2,1)=1 means 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1). Which matches (2,0)=1's info: exactly one mine in (3,0) or (3,1).\n\nSo (3,0) and (3,1) have exactly one mine between them.\n\nNow, let's look at row 3, column 2 which is 2. Its adjacent cells include (3,1) and (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (3,3). Since (3,2)=2, and (2,1)=1 (which has one mine in (3,0)\/(3,1)), if (3,1) is a mine, then (3,2)'s count would include that. Let's suppose (3,1) is a mine. Then (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1 are satisfied (since (3,1) is the mine). Then (3,2)=2 would need one more mine in its adjacent cells (since (3,1) is one mine). The adjacent cells of (3,2) are (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,1)=1 (safe), (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (3,1)=mine (if we assume), so remaining cells (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) need one mine. \n\nAlternatively, if (3,0) is the mine, then (3,1) is safe. Then (3,2)=2 would need two mines in its adjacent cells, which would be (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). \n\nBut maybe there's a better cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, so (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. (0,1) is 0, so (0,2) is 2, which is safe (it's a number). (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0, so (1,2) is 2 (safe). So the cells (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are all 0, which means their adjacent cells are all safe. The next cells around them are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), which are numbers (2, 2, 1, 1), so they are safe. \n\nNow, the cells adjacent to these 0s that are still unknown: (2,0) is 1, (2,1) is 1, (0,2) is 2, (1,2) is 2. Let's check the cells adjacent to (0,2) which is 2. (0,2)'s adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe). So the 2 mines here must be in (0,3) and (1,3). Because there are two adjacent cells left (0,3) and (1,3). Wait, (0,2) has 8 adjacent cells, but (0,2) is in row 0, column 2, so the adjacent cells are:\n\n(0-1,2-1) invalid (row -1)\n(0-1,2) invalid\n(0-1,2+1) invalid\n(0,2-1) = (0,1) = 0 (safe)\n(0,2+1) = (0,3) = ?\n(0+1,2-1) = (1,1) = 0 (safe)\n(0+1,2) = (1,2) = 2 (safe)\n(0+1,2+1) = (1,3) = ?\n\nSo (0,2) has two adjacent cells that are unknown: (0,3) and (1,3). Since (0,2) is 2, those two must be mines! Because there are exactly two unknown adjacent cells, and the count is 2. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. That's a key insight.\n\nLet me confirm: (0,2) is 2. The adjacent cells are (0,1) (safe), (0,3) (unknown), (1,1) (safe), (1,2) (safe), (1,3) (unknown). The other adjacent cells (like (0-1, ...)) are out of bounds. So only (0,3) and (1,3) are adjacent and unknown. So (0,2) being 2 means those two are mines. That's a sure thing.\n\nSo (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Therefore, we can flag them. But wait, the current board's row 0 shows \"0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so (0,3) is the 4th cell (index 3), which is '?'. Similarly, row 1 is \"0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", so (1,3) is the 4th cell (index 3), which is '?'. So these two cells should be flagged.\n\nBut let's check another cell to confirm. Let's look at (1,2) which is 2. (1,2) is in row 1, column 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1) = 0 (safe)\n(0,2) = 2 (safe)\n(0,3) = ? (mine, as per above)\n(1,1) = 0 (safe)\n(1,3) = ? (mine, as per above)\n(2,1) = 1 (safe)\n(2,2) = 2 (safe)\n(2,3) = 1 (safe)\n\nSo (1,2) has two adjacent mines: (0,3) and (1,3), which matches its count of 2. Perfect, that confirms our earlier conclusion.\n\nSo (0,3) and (1,3) are definitely mines. So we should flag them. But wait, the problem says the game ends when you uncover a mine or reach 100 epochs. The current score is 0.0, flags 0\/29 (probably a typo, should be 0\/10 since there are 10 mines). So flagging these two would increase the score.\n\nBut let's check if there are other safe cells to uncover. For example, let's look at (2,3) which is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=mine (flagged), (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2 (safe), (2,4)=?, (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=?, (3,4)=1 (safe). Since (1,3) is a mine, (2,3) is 1, so the remaining adjacent cells (1,4), (2,4), (3,3) must have 0 mines. Because (2,3) counts 1 mine, which is (1,3). So (1,4), (2,4), (3,3) are safe. That's another insight.\n\nLet's verify: (2,3) is 1. Adjacent mines: (1,3) is a mine (count 1). So the other adjacent cells (1,4), (2,4), (3,3) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (1,4), (2,4), (3,3) would be safe.\n\nSimilarly, (3,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=? (safe, from above), (2,5)=?, (3,3)=? (safe, from above), (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. Since (3,4) is 1, and (2,4) and (3,3) are safe, the mine must be in one of the remaining cells: (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nBut let's focus on the safe cells we found. (1,4), (2,4), (3,3) are safe. Let's pick one of them to uncover. Let's say (2,4). Uncovering (2,4) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,3). Since (2,3) is 1 and (1,3) is a mine, (3,3) is safe. So uncovering (3,3) is safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, so their adjacent cells. Wait, (0,3) is a mine, so (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3). But (0,4) is unknown. (0,3) is a mine, so (0,4) is adjacent to a mine, but we don't know how many.\n\nBut the safest move is to uncover a cell that's definitely safe. Let's go back to (2,4). Since (2,3) is 1, and (1,3) is a mine, (2,4) is safe. So uncovering (2,4) is a good move.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,3). (3,3) is adjacent to (2,3)=1 (which has (1,3) as a mine), so (3,3) is safe. So uncovering (3,3) is safe.\n\nLet's confirm (3,3): (2,3) is 1, adjacent cells include (3,3). Since (2,3) has only one mine (1,3), (3,3) must be safe. So (3,3) is safe.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover (3,3) or (2,4) or (1,4). Let's pick (3,3) as the target.\n\nWait, let's check the coordinates. The current board's row 3 is \"? ? 2 ? 1 ? ? ? ?\", so columns 0: ?, 1: ?, 2:2, 3:?, 4:1, 5:?, etc. So (3,3) is column 3, row 3, which is '?'. Uncovering that would be safe.\n\nYes, that's a safe move. So the action should be to uncover (3,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,3)","uncover (3,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board provided. The user mentioned it's a Minesweeper game, 9x9 grid, but the current board display seems a bit off—maybe a formatting issue? Let's parse the given board correctly. The rows are labeled from 0 to 18? Wait, no, Minesweeper is 9x9, so probably a typo in the display. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? ? ? ... (assuming each number is a cell)\nRow 1: 0 0 2 ? ...\nRow 2: 1 1 2 1 ? ...\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 ? ...\nRow 4 to 18: all ?\n\nWait, maybe the rows are 0-8 (9 rows), and the display is just showing each row with 17 cells, which is incorrect. Probably a formatting error when pasting. Let's assume the correct 9x9 grid, and the visible cells are in the top-left corner.\n\nLet's list the visible cells with their coordinates (row, col):\n\n(0,0): 0\n(0,1): 0\n(0,2): 2\n(1,0): 0\n(1,1): 0\n(1,2): 2\n(2,0): 1\n(2,1): 1\n(2,2): 2\n(2,3): 1\n(3,2): 2\n(3,3): 1\n(3,4): 1\n\nThese are the cells that are uncovered, showing numbers. The rest are '?'. \n\nNow, let's analyze these numbers to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nStarting with the 0s. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells, so all 8 neighbors are safe. Let's check (0,0): 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are already uncovered and also 0, which makes sense. So the 0s in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) indicate that their adjacent cells (like (0,2) is 2, which is next to 0s but 2 has mines around it) are safe beyond that.\n\nNext, (0,2) is 2. Let's list its adjacent cells. (0,2) is at row 0, column 2. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1): 0 (uncovered)\n(0,3): ? (unknown)\n(1,1): 0 (uncovered)\n(1,2): 2 (uncovered)\n(1,3): ? (unknown)\nSo the 2 at (0,2) has two adjacent unknown cells: (0,3) and (1,3). Since the 2 indicates there are 2 mines in its 8 neighbors, and the uncovered neighbors (0,1, 1,1, 1,2) are all safe (since they are 0 or 2, but 2 is a number, not a mine), the two mines must be in (0,3) and (1,3). Wait, but (1,2) is 2. Let's check (1,2)'s adjacent cells. (1,2) is row 1, column 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1): 0 (safe)\n(0,2): 2 (safe)\n(0,3): ?\n(1,1): 0 (safe)\n(1,3): ?\n(2,1): 1 (safe)\n(2,2): 2 (safe)\n(2,3): 1 (safe)\nSo (1,2) is 2, so there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The uncovered ones are all safe, so the mines must be in (0,3) and (1,3), same as (0,2). That's consistent: both (0,2) and (1,2) are 2, and their only unknown adjacent cells are (0,3) and (1,3), so those two must be mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. So we should flag those?\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. (2,2) is 2. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n(1,1): 0 (safe)\n(1,2): 2 (safe)\n(1,3): ? (possible mine)\n(2,1): 1 (safe)\n(2,3): 1 (safe)\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): 2 (safe)\n(3,3): 1 (safe)\nSo (2,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells that are unknown are (1,3), (3,1). The known adjacent cells are all safe. So the 2 here means there are 2 mines in (1,3) and (3,1). But earlier, (0,2) and (1,2) suggest (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. If (1,3) is a mine, then (2,2) has one mine there, so the other mine must be (3,1). That's possible.\n\nThen (2,3) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,3) is row 2, column 3. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2): 2 (safe)\n(1,3): ? (possible mine)\n(1,4): ?\n(2,2): 2 (safe)\n(2,4): ?\n(3,2): 2 (safe)\n(3,3): 1 (safe)\n(3,4): 1 (safe)\nSo (2,3) is 1, meaning 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cells are (1,3), (1,4), (2,4). If (1,3) is a mine (from previous), then that's the 1 mine, so (1,4) and (2,4) are safe.\n\nThen (3,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(2,2): 2 (safe)\n(2,3): 1 (safe)\n(2,4): ? (possible safe)\n(3,2): 2 (safe)\n(3,4): 1 (safe)\n(4,2): ?\n(4,3): ?\n(4,4): ?\nSo (3,3) is 1. The unknown adjacent cells are (2,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). If (2,4) is safe (from (2,3) being 1 and (1,3) being the mine), then (3,3)'s 1 must be in one of (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). But not sure yet.\n\n(3,4) is 1. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,4) is row 3, column 4. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,3): 1 (safe)\n(2,4): ? (safe)\n(2,5): ?\n(3,3): 1 (safe)\n(3,5): ?\n(4,3): ?\n(4,4): ?\n(4,5): ?\nSo (3,4) is 1. If (2,4) is safe (from (2,3)), then the 1 mine here could be in (2,5), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). But not sure.\n\nNow, let's go back to (3,2) which is 2. (3,2) is row 3, column 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,1): 1 (safe)\n(2,2): 2 (safe)\n(2,3): 1 (safe)\n(3,1): ? (possible mine from (2,2)'s 2)\n(3,3): 1 (safe)\n(4,1): ?\n(4,2): ?\n(4,3): ?\nSo (3,2) is 2. Its unknown adjacent cells are (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). From (2,2) being 2, we thought (3,1) might be a mine. If (3,1) is a mine, then (3,2) has 1 mine there, so another mine in (4,1), (4,2), or (4,3).\n\nBut maybe there's a safer cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s, because 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe, and those cells can be uncovered automatically.\n\nLooking at the 0s in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Their adjacent cells include (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), which are already uncovered. The next layer: for example, (2,0) is 1. Let's check (2,0) adjacent cells. (2,0) is row 2, column 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,0): 0 (safe)\n(1,1): 0 (safe)\n(2,1): 1 (safe)\n(3,0): ?\n(3,1): ?\nSo (2,0) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in (3,0) or (3,1). Since (2,0) is 1, and (1,0) and (1,1) are 0, which are safe, the mine must be in either (3,0) or (3,1).\n\n(2,1) is 1. (2,1) is row 2, column 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,0): 0 (safe)\n(1,1): 0 (safe)\n(1,2): 2 (safe)\n(2,0): 1 (safe)\n(2,2): 2 (safe)\n(3,0): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): 2 (safe)\nSo (2,1) is 1, meaning 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknown cells are (3,0) and (3,1). So (2,0) and (2,1) both are 1, and their only unknown adjacent cells are (3,0) and (3,1). That means exactly one of (3,0) or (3,1) is a mine. Because (2,0) has 1 mine in those two, and (2,1) also has 1 mine in those two. So if one is a mine, the other is safe.\n\nBut how does that help us? Maybe not immediately. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, (0,3) and (1,3) we thought might be mines, but let's confirm. (0,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). The uncovered ones are (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2. So 0s are safe, 2 is a number (safe). So the 2 mines must be in (0,3) and (1,3). That's two mines. Then (1,2) is 2, which has adjacent cells (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. The 0s and numbers are safe, so the 2 mines are (0,3) and (1,3), which matches (0,2)'s 2. So that's confirmed. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. So we should flag those. But the user's current flags are 0\/29 (wait, total mines are 10, so maybe a typo, Flags: 0\/10). But regardless, if we can flag those, that's good. But maybe we can uncover a safe cell first.\n\nWait, the 0s in (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) mean that all their adjacent cells are safe, which are (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1). Those are already uncovered. The next layer from 0s: the cells adjacent to those 0s' adjacent cells. For example, (2,0) is 1, which is adjacent to (3,0) and (3,1). But we can't be sure. Let's look at (3,4) which is 1. Its adjacent cells include (2,4), which if (2,3) is 1 and (1,3) is a mine, then (2,4) is safe. Because (2,3) is 1, and (1,3) is the mine, so (2,4) is safe. So (2,4) can be uncovered safely.\n\nWait, (2,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=?, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. We know (1,3) is a mine (from earlier), so that's 1 mine. Therefore, the remaining adjacent cells (1,4), (2,4) must be safe. So (2,4) is safe. So we can uncover (2,4).\n\nAlternatively, (3,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (2,4). If (2,4) is safe, then uncovering (2,4) is safe. Let's check (3,4): 1. Adjacent cells are (2,3)=1, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=?, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. If (2,4) is safe, then uncovering it would show a number, which might help.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at (0,3) and (1,3). If they are mines, then flagging them would be correct. But the problem is, the user hasn't flagged any yet, so maybe we should start by uncovering a safe cell. Since (2,4) is safe (from (2,3) being 1 and (1,3) being a mine), let's uncover (2,4).\n\nWait, let's confirm (2,3)=1. The adjacent cells: (1,3) is a mine (from (0,2) and (1,2) being 2). So that's 1 mine. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (1,4), (2,4), (3,4) (but (3,4) is already uncovered as 1) must be safe. So (1,4) and (2,4) are safe. So (2,4) is safe. So uncovering (2,4) is a good move.\n\nSo the action would be to uncover (2,4). Let's check the coordinates. The current board shows row 3 as \"? ? 2 1 1 ? ...\", so row 3, column 4 is 1. So row 2, column 4 is (2,4), which is in the third row (row 2) and fifth column (column 4). That should be a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,4)","uncover (2,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a partial board, but wait, the initial description says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 17 rows? That might be a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the current board is displayed row by row, but perhaps it's a typo. Let's focus on the visible cells.\n\nLooking at the first few rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 ? 2 0 0 0 1 ? ... (assuming maybe the rows are cut off, but maybe it's a 17-row display, which is confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, and the actual board is 9x9. Let's assume that the first 9 rows are the actual game board, and the rest are typos. Let's check row 0 to row 8 as the 9x9 grid.)\n\nWait, the input example shows 'uncover (3,4)', which is row 3, column 4. So the board is 9x9, with rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. Let's parse the current board correctly. The user's current board is written as lines, each line representing a row. Let's list the visible cells:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: All ? (unknown)\n\nSo the visible cells are in rows 0-3, columns 0-8. Let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered or flagged based on the numbers.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Let's start with row 0, column 0: it's 0, meaning no mines around. So all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Looking at row 0, column 1 is 0, row 1, column 0 is 0, row 1, column 1 is 0. That checks out, as 0s mean no mines around.\n\nRow 0, column 2 is 2. Let's list its adjacent cells. (0,2) is at (row 0, column 2). Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?\n\nSo the adjacent cells with unknowns are (0,3) and (1,3). The number is 2, so there must be 2 mines in these two cells. So (0,3) and (1,3) are both mines? Because there are only two unknown adjacent cells, and the count is 2. That's a key point. So (0,3) and (1,3) should be mines. So we can flag those.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (0,2) has value 2. Adjacent cells:\n\nTop: (0,1) is 0 (safe)\nBottom: (1,2) is 2 (number, not a mine)\nLeft: (0,1) again, same as top\nRight: (0,3) is ?\nTop-left: ( -1,1) invalid\nTop-right: ( -1,3) invalid\nBottom-left: (1,1) is 0 (safe)\nBottom-right: (1,3) is ?\n\nSo the adjacent cells are (0,3), (1,2), (1,3). Wait, (1,2) is 2, which is a number, so it's not a mine. So the possible mine positions are (0,3) and (1,3). The count is 2, so both must be mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. So we should flag those.\n\nNext, row 0, column 4 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,4) is at row 0, column 4. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3)=?, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0.\n\nOther adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (0,4-1)= (0,3), (0,4+1)= (0,5), (1,4-1)= (1,3), (1,4+1)= (1,5). So (0,3), (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. So the unknown adjacent cells are (0,3) and (1,3). We already determined from (0,2) that (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, which would mean that (0,4) has 2 mines adjacent, which matches the 2. That checks out.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (1,2) is row 1, column 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1.\n\nUnknown cells here are (0,3) and (1,3). Again, the count is 2, so (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. That's consistent with previous.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=?, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. The unknowns are (0,3) and (1,3). Again, 2 mines here, which matches the 2. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 1. Let's check (2,3)=1. Adjacent cells: (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. The unknown here is (1,3)=?. Since (1,3) is a mine (from earlier), the count for (2,3) is 1, which would be correct because (1,3) is a mine. That works.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells: (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=?. The unknowns here are (1,3)=? (mine) and (3,5)=?. The count is 2, so (1,3) is 1 mine, so (3,5) must be 0. Wait, 2 mines needed. If (1,3) is a mine (1), then (3,5) would need to be 1 mine to reach 2. But (3,5) is in row 3, column 5, which is currently unknown (row 3 is [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?]). So (3,5) is ?.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 2. Let's check (3,2)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?. The unknowns here are (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). The count is 2, so 2 mines in these four cells.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The count is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent unknowns.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. The count is 1, so 1 mine in adjacent unknowns.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. A 0 cell means all adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover them. Let's check row 0, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. So (0,6) is 0, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. So row 0, column 6 is 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (0,6)=0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. So (0,7)=0, which is a 0 cell. So (0,7) is 0, meaning its adjacent cells are safe. (0,7)=0's adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. So (0,8)=1 is a number, (1,8)=2 is a number.\n\nRow 0, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9) invalid, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (1,9) invalid. So (0,8) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,7)=1 and (1,8)=2. But (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 2, which are numbers, not mines. So maybe (0,8) is 1 because one of the adjacent cells (like (1,7) or (1,8)) has a mine, but since they are numbers, perhaps (0,8) is 1 because of a mine in (1,8)'s adjacent? Wait, no. The number in (0,8) is the count of mines in its 8 adjacent cells. (0,8) is at the top right corner, so adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (number, not mine), (1,8) is 2 (number, not mine). So where is the mine that makes (0,8) a 1? That suggests that maybe (0,8) is 1 because one of the adjacent cells is a mine, but (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) are all numbers, so perhaps there's a mistake here, or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is displayed with more rows than 9, but that's unclear. Let's focus on the cells that are 0, as those are safe to uncover their adjacent cells. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0, so (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe, which are already uncovered (they are 0s). Row 0, column 1 is 0, same thing. Row 0, column 5 is 0, so its adjacent cells (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1 are all uncovered. Row 0, column 6 is 0, so adjacent cells (0,5)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1 are uncovered. Row 0, column 7 is 0, so adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2 are uncovered. So these 0 cells' adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 0 is 0, adjacent cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1. All uncovered. Row 1, column 1 is 0, adjacent cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,0)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2. All uncovered. Row 1, column 5 is 0, adjacent cells (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 0 is 1. Adjacent cells (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. So (3,0) and (3,1) are unknown. The count is 1, so there's 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1), (2,2)=2 (not mine), (1,2)=2 (not mine), etc. So (3,0) and (3,1) have 1 mine.\n\nRow 2, column 1 is 1. Adjacent cells (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. So same as row 2, column 0: 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1).\n\nRow 2, column 2 is 2. Adjacent cells (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=1, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. The unknowns are (1,3)=? (mine) and (3,1)=?. The count is 2. Since (1,3) is a mine (from earlier), then (3,1) must be a mine as well to reach 2. So (3,1) is a mine.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 1. Adjacent cells (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=?, (3,6)=?. The count is 1. (1,6)=1 is a number, (2,6)=2 is a number. So (3,5) and (3,6) have 1 mine.\n\nRow 2, column 6 is 2. Adjacent cells (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=?, (3,6)=?, (3,7)=?. The count is 2. So 2 mines in (1,7)=1 (number), (2,7)=?, (3,5)=?, (3,6)=?, (3,7)=?.\n\nRow 3, column 0 is ?, adjacent to (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=? (mine), (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. Since (3,1) is a mine (from row 2, column 2's analysis), and row 2, column 0 has a count of 1, which would be satisfied by (3,1) being a mine, so (3,0) is safe. Because (2,0)=1's adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (2,1)=1, (1,0)=0, etc. Since (3,1) is a mine, that's 1 mine, so (3,0) must be safe. So (3,0) can be uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is ?, which we think is a mine (from row 2, column 2's analysis). So we should flag (3,1).\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?. The count is 1. Since (3,2)=2 is a number, (2,3)=1 is a number, (2,4)=2 is a number, (2,2)=2 is a number, the unknowns are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So 1 mine among these three.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=?, (4,4)=?, (4,5)=?. The count is 1. So 1 mine in (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. For example, (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0)=1, and since (3,1) is a mine (which contributes to the 1 count of (2,0)), (3,0) must be safe. So uncovering (3,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (3,4). The user's example input was 'uncover (3,4)', but let's see if that's safe. (3,4) is 1, which is a number, so it's already uncovered. Wait, the current board for row 3 is [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?]. So (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. So those are already uncovered. So maybe I need to look for other cells.\n\nLooking back, (0,3) and (1,3) are likely mines. Let's confirm again. (0,2)=2 has adjacent cells (0,3) and (1,3) as the only unknowns, so both must be mines. So flagging (0,3) and (1,3) would be correct.\n\nSo possible actions: flag (0,3) and flag (1,3). Also, (3,1) is a mine, so flag (3,1).\n\nBut let's check if there are any 0 cells that have adjacent unknowns. For example, row 0, column 5 is 0, and its adjacent cells are all uncovered. Row 0, column 6 is 0, same. Row 0, column 7 is 0, same. Row 1, column 0 is 0, same. Row 1, column 1 is 0, same. Row 1, column 5 is 0, same. So no 0 cells with unknown adjacent cells left to uncover.\n\nThe next step is to look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0)=1. (2,0) has adjacent cells: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. The count is 1, so there's 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). But (3,2)=2 is a number, not a mine. So 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1). Earlier, we thought (3,1) is a mine (from row 2, column 2=2, which has adjacent (1,3)=mine and (3,1)=mine to reach 2). So if (3,1) is a mine, then (3,0) is safe. Therefore, (3,0) can be uncovered safely.\n\nSo the action could be to uncover (3,0). Let's verify:\n\nIf we uncover (3,0), since it's safe, it will show a number indicating the number of adjacent mines. Since (3,1) is a mine, (3,0)'s adjacent cells include (3,1) (mine), (2,0)=1 (number), (2,1)=1 (number), (4,0)=? (unknown), (4,1)=? (unknown). So the number in (3,0) would be the count of mines in those adjacent cells. But since we know (3,1) is a mine, the number would be at least 1. But regardless, uncovering (3,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, another safe cell might be (3,5). Let's see: (2,5)=1 has adjacent cells (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=?, (3,6)=?. The count is 1, so there's 1 mine in (3,5) and (3,6). If we can find another clue, but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to (0,3) and (1,3). Since (0,2)=2 and (1,2)=2 both have those as the only unknown adjacent cells, they must be mines. So flagging those is correct.\n\nSo possible actions:\n\n1. Flag (0,3)\n2. Flag (1,3)\n3. Uncover (3,0)\n\nWhich one is better? Since the goal is to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells, flagging correct mines increases the score. So flagging (0,3) and (1,3) would be good.\n\nLet's confirm (0,3): adjacent to (0,2)=2. (0,2) has 8 adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (0,0)=0, (0,4)=2, (1,0)=0. So the unknowns are (0,3) and (1,3). 2 mines needed, so both are mines. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=2, (0,3)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (0,4)=2. The unknowns are (0,3) and (1,3). 2 mines needed, so both are mines.\n\nSo flagging (0,3) and (1,3) is correct. Let's choose one of them. Let's pick (0,3) first.\n\nSo the action would be 'flag (0,3)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (0,3)","flag (0,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The visible part is the top-left corner, and the rest are unknown (marked with ?). \n\nThe user's goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is based on correct flags, which is 1\/29, but that's probably a typo since there are only 10 mines. Maybe it's 1 correct flag out of some attempts. The board shows a few numbers and a flag (F) at (0,3).\n\nLet's start by analyzing the known cells. Let's list the coordinates with their values. The first row (row 0) has cells from column 0 to 8 as: 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1. Then row 1: 0, 0, 2, ?, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2. Row 2: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, ?. Row 3: ?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?. The rest are all ?.\n\nFirst, let's check the flagged cell at (0,3). If that's a mine, then we need to make sure. But let's see adjacent cells. For example, the cell at (0,2) is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (0,4), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,1) is 0, (0,3) is F (mine), (0,4) is 2. (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 2, (1,3) is ?, (1,4) is 2. The number 2 at (0,2) means there are 2 mines in those 8 cells. Since (0,3) is flagged as a mine, that's one. So there should be one more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown here are (1,3). So (1,3) might be a mine? Wait, (0,2) has neighbors: (0,1) (0,2-1=1, row 0), (0,3) (row 0, col 3), (0,4) (row 0, col 4), (1,1) (row 1, col 1), (1,2) (row 1, col 2), (1,3) (row 1, col 3), (1,4) (row 1, col 4), and (2,1) (row 2, col 1), (2,2) (row 2, col 2), (2,3) (row 2, col 3). Wait, 8 adjacent cells: up, down, left, right, and diagonals. So (0,2) is row 0, col 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1): invalid (row -1)\n(row-1, col): invalid\n(row-1, col+1): invalid\n(row, col-1): (0,1) = 0\n(row, col+1): (0,3) = F\n(row+1, col-1): (1,1) = 0\n(row+1, col): (1,2) = 2\n(row+1, col+1): (1,3) = ?\n\nSo that's 8 cells. The 8 adjacent cells for (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). Wait, no, 8 cells around (0,2) are:\n\nTop-left: (0-1, 2-1) = (-1,1) invalid\nTop: (0-1,2) = (-1,2) invalid\nTop-right: (0-1,2+1)=(-1,3) invalid\nLeft: (0,2-1)=(0,1)=0\nRight: (0,2+1)=(0,3)=F\nBottom-left: (0+1,2-1)=(1,1)=0\nBottom: (0+1,2)=(1,2)=2\nBottom-right: (0+1,2+1)=(1,3)=?\n\nSo the 8 adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). The number at (0,2) is 2, which means there are 2 mines in these 5 cells (since the rest are invalid). (0,1) is 0 (so not a mine), (1,1) is 0 (not a mine), (1,2) is 2 (a number, so not a mine). So the possible mines are (0,3) (flagged) and (1,3). So (0,2) has 2 mines, so (0,3) and (1,3) must be mines. That means the F at (0,3) is correct (since (0,2) needs 2 mines, and (1,3) must be a mine). So (1,3) is a mine. So we should flag (1,3).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. Let's look at (0,4) which is 2. Its adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (0,4-1)=(0,3)=F, (0,4+1)=(0,5)=0. The 8 adjacent cells for (0,4) (row 0, col 4):\n\nTop-left: (0-1,4-1)=(-1,3) invalid\nTop: (0-1,4)=(-1,4) invalid\nTop-right: (0-1,4+1)=(-1,5) invalid\nLeft: (0,3)=F\nRight: (0,5)=0\nBottom-left: (1,3)=?\nBottom: (1,4)=2\nBottom-right: (1,5)=0\n\nSo the 8 cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). The number at (0,4) is 2, so 2 mines here. (0,3) is F (mine), (0,5) is 0 (not mine), (1,4) is 2 (not mine), (1,5) is 0 (not mine). So the only possible mine is (1,3). So (0,4) has 2 mines: (0,3) and (1,3). That confirms (1,3) is a mine. So (1,3) should be flagged.\n\nNow, let's check (1,2) which is 2. Its adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. The number 2 here means 2 mines in these 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(0,1)=0 (no), (0,2)=2 (no), (0,3)=F (yes), (1,1)=0 (no), (1,3)=? (maybe yes), (2,1)=1 (no), (2,2)=2 (no), (2,3)=1 (no). So the mines here are (0,3) and (1,3), which is 2. That matches the 2 at (1,2). So that's correct.\n\nNext, (1,4) is 2. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. The 8 cells. The number is 2, so 2 mines. (0,3)=F (1), (1,3)=? (maybe 1). So (1,3) is a mine here as well. So (1,3) is definitely a mine. So we should flag (1,3).\n\nAnother cell: (2,3) is 1. Let's see its adjacent cells. (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. The number is 1, so 1 mine in these 8. Let's see which could be. (1,3)=? (if it's a mine, that's 1, which matches). So (2,3) being 1 would make sense if (1,3) is a mine.\n\nSo (1,3) is a mine. So the action should be to flag (1,3). But let's check the input format: the actions are 'uncover', 'flag', 'unflag'. So the answer should be 'flag (1,3)'.\n\nWait, but let's make sure there are no other obvious safe cells to uncover. For example, (0,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=? (but the board is 9x9, so columns 0-8. Wait, the current board display shows 0-8 for the first 9 rows, but the user's current board has 17 rows? Wait, the problem says the board is 9x9 grid. Oh, maybe the current board display is a mistake, perhaps it's a 9x9 grid, but the way it's displayed is row 0 to row 8, each with 9 columns. The user's current board shows 17 rows, which is probably a formatting error. Let's assume the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nSo row 0: columns 0-8: [0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,2,?,2,0,1,1,2]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,2,1,2,1,2,?,?]\n\nRow 3: [?,?,2,1,1,?,?,?,?]\n\nRows 4-8: all ?.\n\nSo (0,8) is 1 (row 0, column 8). Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (0,8-1)=(0,7)=0, (0,8+1) invalid (column 9). So 8 adjacent cells: (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (0,8-1) is (0,7), (0,8+1) invalid, (row-1, col-1)=( -1,7) invalid, (row-1, col)=( -1,8) invalid, (row+1, col-1)=(1,7), (row+1, col)=(1,8), (row+1, col+1)=(1,9) invalid. So the 8 cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). The number 1 at (0,8) means 1 mine in these. (0,7) is 0 (not mine), (1,7) is 1 (number, not mine), (1,8) is 2 (number, not mine). Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in adjacent cells. For (0,8) (row 0, column 8), the adjacent cells are:\n\nTop-left: (0-1,8-1)=(-1,7) invalid\n\nTop: (0-1,8)=(-1,8) invalid\n\nTop-right: (0-1,8+1)=(-1,9) invalid\n\nLeft: (0,7)=0\n\nRight: (0,9) invalid (since columns are 0-8)\n\nBottom-left: (1,7)=1\n\nBottom: (1,8)=2\n\nBottom-right: (1,9) invalid\n\nSo the valid adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). So 3 cells. The number 1 at (0,8) means 1 mine in these 3. (0,7) is 0 (not mine), (1,7) is 1 (not mine), (1,8) is 2 (not mine). That's a problem. So maybe (0,8) is 1, but there are no adjacent mines. That can't be. So perhaps the board display is misaligned. Maybe the user's current board is not 9x9 but a larger display, but the actual game is 9x9. Maybe the display is showing row 0 to row 8, each with 9 columns, but the way it's written is that each row is split into parts. For example, the first line is row 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 followed by ? ? ? ... which is maybe a formatting error. Let's ignore that and focus on the 9x9 grid.\n\nBack to (1,3). Since multiple cells (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4) all point to (1,3) being a mine (as their count requires 2 mines, and (0,3) is already a flag), (1,3) must be a mine. So the best action is to flag (1,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (1,3)","flag (1,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's look at the current board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but the display shows 17 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the current board is actually a 9x9 grid, but the way it's presented here is split into multiple lines. Let's parse the board correctly.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines:\n\nFirst line: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? — maybe that's the first row (row 0), columns 0-8, then the rest are ? for columns 9-16? No, wait, the Minesweeper board is 9x9, so rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. So maybe the current board is displayed with each row shown as a line, but perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Let's assume each row is 9 cells. Let's correct the rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\nRow 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\nRow 2: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 4: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 5: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 6: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 7: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\nRow 8: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\nThat makes more sense. So rows 0-2 have some uncovered cells, row 3 has some, and the rest are unknown.\n\nLet's list the known cells with their coordinates (row, col):\n\nRow 0:\n(0,0): 0\n(0,1): 0\n(0,2): 2\n(0,3): F (flagged)\n(0,4): 2\n(0,5): 0\n(0,6): 0\n(0,7): 0\n(0,8): 1\n\nRow 1:\n(1,0): 0\n(1,1): 0\n(1,2): 2\n(1,3): F (flagged)\n(1,4): 2\n(1,5): 0\n(1,6): 1\n(1,7): 1\n(1,8): 2\n\nRow 2:\n(2,0): 1\n(2,1): 1\n(2,2): 2\n(2,3): 1\n(2,4): 2\n(2,5): 1\n(2,6): 2\n(2,7): ?\n(2,8): ?\n\nRow 3:\n(3,0): ?\n(3,1): ?\n(3,2): 2\n(3,3): 1\n(3,4): 1\n(3,5): ?\n(3,6): ?\n(3,7): ?\n(3,8): ?\n\nNow, let's analyze the flagged cells (F). The user has flagged 2 cells so far, at (0,3) and (1,3). The total mines are 10, so there are 8 more mines to find.\n\nFirst, let's check if the existing flags are correct. For example, let's look at (0,3) which is flagged. Let's check its neighbors. The cell (0,2) is 2, which means there are 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0 (uncovered, safe), (0,3) is F (flagged as mine), (1,1) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 2 (uncovered), (1,3) is F (flagged). So (0,2) has two adjacent flagged cells: (0,3) and (1,3). Since (0,2) is 2, that suggests those two flags are correct because 2 mines are there. That's a good sign. Let's confirm with (1,2) which is 2. The adjacent cells to (1,2) are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So adjacent cells with F are (0,3) and (1,3). So (1,2) is 2, which matches the two flagged mines. That's correct. So those two flags are likely correct.\n\nNow, let's look for safe cells to uncover. Let's start with cells that have 0, because those will automatically uncover all adjacent cells. For example, row 0, column 0 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are already uncovered and are 0, so no new info there. Row 0, column 1 is 0, same as above.\n\nRow 0, column 5 is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,5) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 2 (uncovered), (0,6) is 0 (uncovered), (1,4) is 2 (uncovered), (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). So all adjacent cells are safe, so no new cells to uncover here.\n\nRow 0, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. All uncovered, so no new cells.\n\nRow 0, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,0)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that might indicate safe cells. Let's take row 0, column 8 which is 1. The adjacent cells to (0,8) are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. So (0,8) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (uncovered), (1,8) is 2 (uncovered). Wait, (0,8) is at (row 0, column 8), so adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), but since row 0 is the top, row-1 is invalid. So adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) is 0 (safe), so the mine must be in either (1,7) or (1,8). But (1,7) is 1, which is a number, so it's uncovered and safe. (1,8) is 2, which is uncovered and safe. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in coordinates. The cell (0,8) is the top-right of row 0. Its adjacent cells would be (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). All of these are uncovered: (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. Since (0,8) is 1, that means there's 1 mine in those three adjacent cells. But all three are uncovered (they are numbers, not ? or F), which suggests that the mine count here is already satisfied. Maybe the 1 in (0,8) is referring to a mine that's flagged? Wait, (0,8) is 1, which is the count of mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). None of these are flagged (F), so the 1 must be a mine that's still hidden. But those cells are already uncovered (they have numbers), which means that's impossible. So perhaps the 1 in (0,8) is correct, and the adjacent cells have 1 mine. But (0,7) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 1 (safe), (1,8) is 2 (safe), so the mine must be in one of their adjacent cells? Wait, no. The number in a cell is the count of mines in its 8 adjacent cells, regardless of whether those cells are uncovered or not. So (0,8) is 1, meaning that among its 8 adjacent cells (which are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8) since it's on the edge), there is 1 mine. But (0,7) is uncovered (0, so no mine), (1,7) is uncovered (1, so no mine), (1,8) is uncovered (2, so no mine). That would mean the 1 in (0,8) is incorrect, which can't be. So maybe I messed up the board layout. Let's recheck.\n\nThe user's Current Board is written as:\n\n0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? 2 1 1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n... (more rows of ?)\n\nAh, maybe each row is 17 cells, but that's not possible. The Minesweeper board is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. The user probably pasted the board incorrectly, splitting each row into two parts. Let's assume that the first 9 cells of each line are the actual row, and the rest are a mistake. So:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, ?]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, ?, ?, ?, ?]\nRows 4-8: all ?\n\nThat's more plausible. So row 0 has columns 0-8 as [0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1], row 1 as [0,0,2,F,2,0,1,1,2], row 2 as [1,1,2,1,2,1,2,?,?], row 3 as [?,?,2,1,1,?,?,?,?], and rows 4-8 are all ?.\n\nNow, let's focus on row 3, column 4: (3,4) is 1. Let's look at its adjacent cells. (3,4) is 1, so there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5)\n\nWe know (2,3) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (2,4) is 2 (uncovered, safe), (2,5) is 1 (uncovered, safe), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered, safe). So the adjacent cells that are known are safe. The unknown adjacent cells are (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). So the 1 mine in (3,4)'s neighbors must be in one of these four.\n\nNow, let's look at (3,3) which is 1. (3,3) is 1, so it has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (3,3) are:\n\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4),\n(3,2), (3,4),\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4)\n\n(2,2) is 2 (uncovered), (2,3) is 1 (uncovered), (2,4) is 2 (uncovered), (3,2) is 2 (uncovered), (3,4) is 1 (uncovered). So the known cells here are all safe. The unknown ones are (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). So (3,3)'s 1 mine is in one of these three.\n\nAlso, (3,2) is 2. Let's check (3,2): 2 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,3),\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3)\n\n(2,1) is 1 (uncovered), (2,2) is 2 (uncovered), (2,3) is 1 (uncovered), (3,1) is ? (unknown), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,1) is ? (unknown), (4,2) is ? (unknown), (4,3) is ? (unknown). So (3,2) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which are (3,1), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), and maybe (3,1) is part of it.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0s. Let's check row 0, column 5: it's 0. So all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,5) are:\n\n(0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\n\n(0,4) is 2 (uncovered), (0,6) is 0 (uncovered), (1,4) is 2 (uncovered), (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). All are safe, so no new cells here.\n\nRow 1, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6)\n\n(0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2. All uncovered and safe.\n\nRow 0, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\n(0,5)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 0, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8)\n\n(0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)\n\n(0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 1 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\n(0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,0)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at row 2, column 6 which is 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\n(1,5)=0 (safe), (1,6)=1 (safe), (1,7)=1 (safe), (2,5)=1 (safe), (2,7)=? (unknown), (3,5)=? (unknown), (3,6)=? (unknown), (3,7)=? (unknown). So (2,6) is 2, meaning there are 2 mines in its adjacent unknown cells: (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6)\n\n(1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe), (1,6)=1 (safe), (2,4)=2 (safe), (2,6)=2 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=? (unknown), (3,6)=? (unknown). So (2,5) is 1, so 1 mine in (3,5), (3,6).\n\nRow 2, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)\n\n(1,3)=F (flagged as mine), (1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=0 (safe), (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,5)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=? (unknown). So (2,4) is 2. We already have 1 mine (flagged at (1,3)), so there must be 1 more mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent unknown cell is (3,5). So (3,5) is a mine? Because (2,4) is 2, and (1,3) is a mine (flagged), so the other mine must be in (3,5). Let's check:\n\n(2,4) has adjacent cells: (1,3)=F (mine), and others are safe except (3,5). So 2 mines: (1,3) and (3,5). That makes sense. So (3,5) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (3,5). But wait, let's confirm with other cells.\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,5) and (3,6). If (3,5) is a mine, then (2,5)=1 would mean that (3,6) is safe. Because 1 mine in (3,5) and (3,6), so if (3,5) is mine, (3,6) is safe.\n\nRow 3, column 4 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4)=1 has that mine, so the other adjacent cells (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are safe.\n\nRow 3, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells include (4,3), (4,4). If (3,3)=1, and assuming (3,5) is a mine (from (2,4)), then (3,3)'s mine could be in (4,3) or (4,4), but if (4,3) and (4,4) are safe (from (3,4)=1), then that's a conflict. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet's re-express (2,4)=2. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3) - F (mine)\n(1,4) - 2 (safe)\n(1,5) - 0 (safe)\n(2,3) - 1 (safe)\n(2,5) - 1 (safe)\n(3,3) - 1 (safe)\n(3,4) - 1 (safe)\n(3,5) - ?\n\nSo (2,4) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. We have one mine at (1,3) (flagged), so there must be one more mine in the adjacent cells. The only unknown adjacent cell is (3,5). Therefore, (3,5) must be a mine. So we should flag (3,5).\n\nBut wait, the user's current flags are 2\/29, which is 2 flags. If we flag (3,5), that would be 3 flags. But let's confirm if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. For example, row 3, column 4 is 1. If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4)'s 1 is satisfied, so the other adjacent cells (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are safe. So uncovering (4,4) would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 7 (which is ?). Let's see if we can determine if it's safe. (2,7) is adjacent to (2,6)=2. (2,6) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells, which are (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). If (3,5) is a mine (from (2,4)), then (2,6) has 1 mine so far, so there's 1 more mine in (2,7), (3,6), (3,7). But we don't have enough info.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 4 (1). If we uncover (3,4), but wait, (3,4) is already uncovered as 1. Oh, right, (3,4) is 1. So we need to find a ? cell to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 7 and 8 are ?. Let's check (2,7). Its adjacent cells are (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,8)=?, (3,6)=?, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?.\n\n(1,7)=1: adjacent cells to (1,7) are (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?.\n\n(1,7) is 1, so 1 mine in its adjacent cells. (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, (1,8)=2 are all safe. So the mine must be in (2,6), (2,7), (2,8). (2,6)=2 (safe), so (2,7) or (2,8) is a mine. But (2,6)=2, which has adjacent cells including (1,7)=1. This is getting too tangled.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, but all 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. So next, look for cells adjacent to 1s where the 1 has only one possible mine, making the other cells safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3, column 0 and 1, which are ?. Let's check (3,0). Its adjacent cells are (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (3,1)=?.\n\n(2,0)=1: adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?.\n\n(2,0) is 1, so 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1).\n\n(2,1)=1: adjacent cells are (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2.\n\n(2,1) is 1, so 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1).\n\nSo both (2,0) and (2,1) have 1 mine each in (3,0), (3,1). That means (3,0) and (3,1) must contain exactly 1 mine. So either (3,0) is a mine and (3,1) is safe, or vice versa. But we can't determine which, so uncovering either is risky.\n\nAnother area: row 3, column 5 is ?, which we thought might be a mine. But if we uncover (3,5) and it's a mine, the game ends. So better to avoid that.\n\nLet's look at row 4, column 4. If (3,4) is 1, and assuming (3,5) is a mine (from (2,4)=2), then (4,4) is adjacent to (3,4)=1. The mine in (3,5) is not adjacent to (4,4), so (4,4) is safe. So (4,4) is a good candidate to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, row 3, column 6: let's see. (3,6) is adjacent to (2,6)=2. If (3,5) is a mine, then (2,6) needs 1 more mine in (2,7), (3,6), (3,7). So (3,6) could be a mine or safe. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row 2, column 8: (2,8) is adjacent to (1,7)=1 and (1,8)=2. (1,8)=2 has adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=?, (3,7)=?, (3,8)=?.\n\n(1,8)=2, so 2 mines in (2,7), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8). (1,7)=1 has 1 mine in (2,7), (2,8). So if (1,7)=1 has 1 mine in (2,7), (2,8), and (1,8)=2 has 2 mines in (2,7), (2,8), (3,7), (3,8), then (2,7) and (2,8) must contain 1 mine (from (1,7)), and (1,8) needs 2 mines, so (3,7) and (3,8) must contain 1 mine. This is too vague.\n\nGiven that, maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell in the area where we can be most certain. Let's go back to (3,4)=1. Its adjacent cells include (4,4), which we think is safe. So uncovering (4,4) is a good move.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but wait, looking at the input, the current board has 17 rows? Wait, no, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the Minesweeper game rules say it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 17 rows, which is probably a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and it's actually 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines: Each line has a series of characters separated by spaces. Let's count the elements per line. The first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 17 elements. Hmm, that can't be 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 17x17 board, but the rules say 9x9. Maybe the input is incorrect, but I need to proceed.\n\nAssuming that the board is correctly presented, but perhaps the rows are split into lines for readability. Alternatively, maybe it's a 9x9 grid, and the numbers are separated by spaces, but the user pasted it with line breaks. Let's see. Let's count the total number of cells. Let's count the elements:\n\nFirst line: 17 elements (0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1,?,1,0,0,0,1,?,?) → 17\nSecond line: 17 → 17\nThird line: 17 → 17\nFourth: 17 → 17\nFifth: 17 → 17\nSixth: 17 → 17\nSeventh: 17 → 17\nEighth: 17 → 17\nNinth: 17 → 17\nTenth: 17 → 17\nEleventh: 17 → 17\nTwelfth: 17 → 17\nThirteenth: 17 → 17\nFourteenth: 17 → 17\nFifteenth: 17 → 17\nSixteenth: 17 → 17\nSeventeenth: 17 → 17\n\nSo 17 rows, each 17 cells. That's a 17x17 grid, which contradicts the initial rule of 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps the actual game is 17x17 with 10 mines? Unlikely, but perhaps the initial rule was a typo. Anyway, I need to focus on the current board.\n\nThe goal is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The current score is 0.0689, which is 2 correct flags out of 10 total mines (since 2\/29 flags, but correct ones are 2, as 2\/10 is 0.2, but 2\/29 is 0.0689). So they have 29 flags placed, but only 2 are correct. They need to flag all 10 mines to win. Alternatively, uncover all safe cells.\n\nThe board has cells marked as 0 (safe, no adjacent mines), numbers (adjacent mines), F (flagged), and ? (unknown).\n\nLooking for cells that can be safely uncovered. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a number that has all its adjacent mines already flagged, then the remaining adjacent ? cells are safe.\n\nLet's take a look at some cells. Let's pick a cell that's a number and check its adjacent cells.\n\nFor example, let's look at row 2 (third line, 0-based), column 10 (since the elements are space-separated). The third line is: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" Let's index from 0:\n\nRow 2: [1,1,2,1,2,1,2,?,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,2,?]\n\nLooking at the cell (2,11) which is 0. A 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe, so any ? around it can be uncovered. Let's check the adjacent cells of (2,11). The 0 is at row 2, column 11. Its adjacent cells would be rows 1-3, columns 10-12.\n\nRow 1 (second line): \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" So row 1, columns 10-12: [1,0,0] (columns 10 is 1, 11 is 0, 12 is 0).\n\nRow 2, columns 10-12: [1,0,0] (column 10 is 1, 11 is 0, 12 is 0).\n\nRow 3 (fourth line): \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" So row 3, columns 10-12: [0,1,1] (column 10 is 0, 11 is 1, 12 is 1).\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting the coordinates wrong. Let's assume that each row is a list of cells, with (row, col) starting at (0,0) as top-left. So for row 2, column 11 is cell (2,11). The adjacent cells would be:\n\n(row-1, col-1): (1,10)\n(row-1, col): (1,11)\n(row-1, col+1): (1,12)\n(row, col-1): (2,10)\n(row, col+1): (2,12)\n(row+1, col-1): (3,10)\n(row+1, col): (3,11)\n(row+1, col+1): (3,12)\n\nCell (2,11) is 0, so all these adjacent cells are safe (no mines). Let's check their current state:\n\n(1,10): row 1, column 10 → \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → index 10 is '1' (already uncovered, number 1)\n(1,11): row 1, column 11 → '0' (uncovered, 0)\n(1,12): row 1, column 12 → '0' (uncovered, 0)\n(2,10): row 2, column 10 → '1' (uncovered, 1)\n(2,12): row 2, column 12 → '0' (uncovered, 0)\n(3,10): row 3, column 10 → row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → index 10 is '0' (uncovered, 0)\n(3,11): row 3, column 11 → '1' (uncovered, 1)\n(3,12): row 3, column 12 → '1' (uncovered, 1)\n\nAll adjacent cells are already uncovered, so no new info here.\n\nLet's look for a 1 cell that has adjacent ? cells. For example, row 0, column 8: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → row 0, column 8 is '1'. The adjacent cells would be (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9).\n\n(0,7): row 0, column 7 → '0' (uncovered)\n(0,9): row 0, column 9 → '?' (unknown)\n(1,7): row 1, column 7 → '1' (uncovered)\n(1,8): row 1, column 8 → '2' (uncovered)\n(1,9): row 1, column 9 → '?' (unknown)\nSo cell (0,8) is 1, meaning there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (0,9) and (1,9). Let's count how many adjacent cells are already flagged (F). In row 0, column 3 is F (cell (0,3)), but that's not adjacent to (0,8). The adjacent cells to (0,8) are (0,7) to (1,9). Are any of them F? Let's check:\n\n(0,3) is F, but that's column 3, row 0. (0,8) is column 8, so 5 columns away, not adjacent. So no F in the adjacent cells of (0,8). So the 1 mine is in either (0,9) or (1,9). But we can't be sure yet.\n\nAnother example: row 4, column 8: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 8 is '0'. A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. Let's find the adjacent cells of (4,8). The 0 is at row 4, column 8. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row 3, col 7): row 3, column 7 → \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → column 7 is '1' (uncovered)\n(row 3, col 8): row 3, column 8 → '1' (uncovered)\n(row 3, col 9): row 3, column 9 → '0' (uncovered)\n(row 4, col 7): row 4, column 7 → '0' (uncovered)\n(row 4, col 9): row 4, column 9 → '1' (uncovered)\n(row 5, col 7): row 5, column 7 → \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 7 is '0' (uncovered)\n(row 5, col 8): row 5, column 8 → '0' (uncovered)\n(row 5, col 9): row 5, column 9 → '1' (uncovered)\n\nAll adjacent cells are already uncovered, so no help.\n\nLooking for a cell with 0 that has adjacent ?. For example, row 5, column 5: row 5 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 5 is '0'. Adjacent cells would be row 4, columns 4-6; row 5, columns 4-6; row 6, columns 4-6.\n\nRow 4, column 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 4 is '1' (uncovered)\nRow 4, column 5: '1' (uncovered)\nRow 4, column 6: '1' (uncovered)\nRow 5, column 4: '0' (uncovered)\nRow 5, column 6: '0' (uncovered)\nRow 6, column 4: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" → column 4 is '0' (uncovered)\nRow 6, column 5: '0' (uncovered)\nRow 6, column 6: '0' (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nHow about row 8, column 4: row 8 is \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → column 4 is '0'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 7, column 3: row 7 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → column 3 is '2' (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 4: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 5: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 3: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 5: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 3: row 9 is \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" → column 3 is '1' (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 4: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 5: '0' (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nLet's look for a number cell that has more ? adjacent than the number, meaning some must be safe. For example, a cell with value 1 that has 2 ? adjacent. Then, one is a mine, the other is safe. But without more info, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's a 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe, so any ? next to a 0 can be uncovered. Wait, let's check row 3, column 9: row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → column 9 is '0'. So (3,9) is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 2, column 8: row 2 is \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" → column 8 is '2' (uncovered)\nrow 2, column 9: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 2, column 10: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 3, column 8: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 3, column 10: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 8: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 8 is '0' (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 9: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 10: '1' (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nAnother 0: row 9, column 5: row 9 is \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" → column 5 is '0'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 8, column 4: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 5: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 6: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 4: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 6: '0' (uncovered)\nrow 10, column 4: row 10 is \"? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → column 4 is '2' (uncovered)\nrow 10, column 5: '1' (uncovered)\nrow 10, column 6: '1' (uncovered)\nAll uncovered.\n\nLet's check row 1, column 3: it's F (flagged). The cell (1,3) is flagged. Let's see the adjacent cells to (1,3) to see if that flag is correct. The cell (1,3) is F, so if the adjacent cells have numbers that require a mine there, it's correct. For example, cell (0,2) is 2 (row 0, column 2). Let's check (0,2): row 0 is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → column 2 is 2. Adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0 (uncovered), (0,3) is F (flagged), (1,1) is 0 (row 1, column 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → 0), (1,2) is 2 (row 1, column 2: 2), (1,3) is F (flagged). So (0,2) is 2, which should have 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F. So the possible mines are (0,3) and (1,3). Since (0,2) is 2, those two Fs would account for the 2 mines. So that's correct. So (0,3) and (1,3) are F, and (0,2) is 2, which matches. So those flags are correct (since 2 adjacent mines, and two flags there). So that's part of the 2 correct flags mentioned (Flags: 2\/29).\n\nNow, let's look for a cell that is a number where the number of adjacent Fs equals the number, so the remaining adjacent ? are safe. For example, if a cell is 2, and there are 2 Fs adjacent, then the rest are safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 4: row 0, column 4 is 2 (row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\"). Adjacent cells to (0,4): (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. So (0,4) is 2. The adjacent Fs are (0,3) and (1,3) → 2 Fs. Since the number is 2, that means all adjacent mines are already flagged. Therefore, the other adjacent cells (which are (0,5)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0) are safe. But (0,5) and (1,5) are already uncovered. (1,4) is 2, which is uncovered. So no new info.\n\nAnother example: row 1, column 4 is 2 (row 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\"). Adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. The number is 2, and adjacent Fs are (0,3) and (1,3) → 2 Fs. So the 2 mines are accounted for, so the rest are safe. Those are already uncovered.\n\nLooking for a cell with a number where the number of adjacent ? is equal to the number minus the number of adjacent Fs. For example, if a cell is 1, has 0 Fs, and 1 ?, then that ? is a mine. Or if a cell is 1, has 0 Fs, and 2 ?s, then one is a mine, but we can't know which.\n\nLet's check row 2, column 7: row 2 is \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" → column 7 is '?'. The cell (2,7) is unknown. Let's look at the adjacent cells to (2,7). The cells around (2,7) are:\n\n(1,6)=1 (row 1, column 6: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → column 6 is 1)\n(1,7)=1 (row 1, column 7: 1)\n(1,8)=2 (row 1, column 8: 2)\n(2,6)=2 (row 2, column 6: 2)\n(2,8)=2 (row 2, column 8: 2)\n(3,6)=2 (row 3, column 6: \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → column 6 is 2)\n(3,7)=1 (row 3, column 7: 1)\n(3,8)=1 (row 3, column 8: 1)\n\nLet's take cell (2,6) which is 2 (row 2, column 6). Its adjacent cells are (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=?, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1. The number is 2, so there should be 2 mines in these adjacent cells. How many Fs are adjacent? None. So 2 mines among the ?s: (2,7) and (3,5).\n\nCell (3,6) is 2 (row 3, column 6). Adjacent cells: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=?, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=0. Number is 2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. Fs: none. So 2 mines in (2,7) and (3,5).\n\nCell (1,8) is 2 (row 1, column 8). Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,9)=?, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2, (2,9)=1. Number is 2. Fs: none. So 2 mines in (0,9), (1,9), (2,7).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find a cell that's a 0 and has adjacent ?. For example, row 5, column 7 is 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 7 is 0). Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 4, column 6: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 6 is 1 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 7: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 6: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 6: row 6 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" → column 6 is 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 7: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nHow about row 7, column 9: row 7 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → column 9 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 6, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 9: 1 (row 6, column 9: 1)\nrow 6, column 10: 1 (row 6, column 10: 1)\nrow 7, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 10: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 8: 0 (row 8, column 8: 0)\nrow 8, column 9: 0 (row 8, column 9: 0)\nrow 8, column 10: 0 (row 8, column 10: 0)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nMaybe look for a cell that's a number with adjacent ?s where the number of ?s is equal to the number, so all ?s are mines. For example, a cell with 1 and 1 ? adjacent, so that ? is a mine. But I need to find such a case.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 11: row 10 is \"? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → column 11 is 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 13, column 11: row 13 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\" → column 11 is 3. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 12, column 10: row 12 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → column 10 is '?'\nrow 12, column 11: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 12, column 12: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 13, column 10: '?'\nrow 13, column 12: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 14, column 10: row 14 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → column 10 is '?'\nrow 14, column 11: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 14, column 12: 0 (uncovered)\nSo cell (13,11) is 3. It has 3 adjacent ?s: (12,10), (13,10), (14,10). Since the number is 3, those 3 ?s must be mines. So we should flag those. But the current flags are 29, which is a lot, so maybe some of these are already flagged. Let's check if (12,10), (13,10), (14,10) are flagged.\n\nRow 12: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → column 10 is '?', not F.\nRow 13: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\" → column 10 is '?', not F.\nRow 14: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → column 10 is '?', not F.\nSo these three cells are ? and should be mines. So we can flag them. But the user's current action is to choose an action. However, the score is based on correct flags, so flagging these would increase the correct count. But maybe the user wants to uncover safe cells to win by uncovering all safe cells.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's a 0 and has adjacent ?. Wait, row 8, column 12: row 8 is \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → column 12 is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 7, column 11: row 7 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → column 11 is 1 (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 12: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 13: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 11: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 13: '?' (unknown)\nrow 9, column 11: row 9 is \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" → column 11 is 0 (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 12: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 13: 1 (uncovered)\nSo cell (8,12) is 1. It has 1 adjacent ? at (8,13). Since the number is 1, that ? must be a mine. So (8,13) is a mine, so we should flag it. But let's confirm.\n\nCell (8,12) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(7,11)=1 (safe)\n(7,12)=2 (safe)\n(7,13)=2 (safe)\n(8,11)=0 (safe)\n(8,13)=? (unknown)\n(9,11)=0 (safe)\n(9,12)=1 (safe)\n(9,13)=1 (safe)\nSo the only unknown is (8,13). Therefore, (8,13) must be a mine. So we should flag (8,13). But let's check if it's already flagged. The current board for row 8, column 13 is '?', so not flagged. So action: flag (8,13). But the user's current flags are 29, which is a lot, but maybe this is a correct one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that's safe to uncover. For example, a cell adjacent to a 0 that's still ?. Let's look for 0 cells again.\n\nRow 5, column 4: 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 4 is 0). Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 4, column 3: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 3 is 1 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 4: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 5: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 3: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 5: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 3: row 6 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" → column 3 is 2 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 4: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 5: 0 (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 4: 0 (row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → column 4 is 0). Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 6, column 3: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 4: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 5: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 3: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 7, column 5: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 3: 1 (row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → column 3 is 1)\nrow 8, column 4: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 8, column 5: 0 (uncovered)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nHmm. Maybe look for a cell that's a 1 with only one ? adjacent, which would mean that ? is a mine. For example, row 14, column 12: row 14 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → column 12 is 0. Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 15, column 12: row 15 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0\" → column 12 is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 14, column 11: 1 (row 14, column 11: 1)\nrow 14, column 12: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 14, column 13: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 15, column 11: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 15, column 13: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 16, column 11: row 16 is \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" → column 11 is '?'\nrow 16, column 12: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 16, column 13: 0 (uncovered)\nSo cell (15,12) is 1. It has 1 adjacent ?: (16,11). So (16,11) must be a mine. So flag (16,11).\n\nBut I need to find a cell to uncover. The safest move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, but I can't find any. Alternatively, a cell that's a ? and not adjacent to any numbers, which is likely safe. For example, the top-left corner. Row 0, column 0 is 0, row 0, column 1 is 0. So (0,0) and (0,1) are 0, which means their adjacent cells are safe. The cell (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. All uncovered. So no help.\n\nAnother approach: the user has 29 flags, which is way more than 10 mines, so many flags are incorrect. Unflagging might help, but the user has 0 unflags. But the problem says to output an action, which can be uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nBut the user's score is 2\/10, so they have 2 correct flags. To win, they need to flag all 10 or uncover all safe cells. Since 29 flags are placed, most are wrong. Uncovering safe cells might be better.\n\nLooking for a cell that's a ? and has a 0 adjacent. For example, row 0, column 15: row 0 is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → column 15 is '?'. Let's see the adjacent cells. (0,15) is (0,15). Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,14)=1 (uncovered)\n(0,16)=? (unknown)\n(1,14)=1 (row 1, column 14: 1)\n(1,15)=? (row 1, column 15: ?)\n(1,16)=? (row 1, column 16: ?)\nSo no 0 adjacent.\n\nRow 4, column 2: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 2 is '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 3, column 1: row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → column 1 is '?'\nrow 3, column 2: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 3, column 3: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 1: '?'\nrow 4, column 3: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 1: '?'\nrow 5, column 2: '?'\nrow 5, column 3: 2 (uncovered)\nSo adjacent to a 2 (row 3, column 2), which is 2. The 2 at (3,2) has adjacent cells including (4,2). If (3,2) is 2, and some of its adjacent cells are ?, but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, pick a cell that's in a corner of 0s. For example, row 8, column 0: row 8 is \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" → column 0 is '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 7, column 0: '?'\nrow 7, column 1: '?'\nrow 7, column 2: '?'\nrow 8, column 1: '?'\nrow 8, column 2: '?'\nrow 9, column 0: '?'\nrow 9, column 1: '?'\nrow 9, column 2: '?'\nAll are ?. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's a ? and has a 0 in its vicinity. For example, row 3, column 5: row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → column 5 is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. (3,5) is adjacent to (2,4)=2 (row 2, column 4: 2), (2,5)=1 (row 2, column 5: 1), (2,6)=2 (row 2, column 6: 2), (3,4)=1 (row 3, column 4: 1), (3,6)=2 (row 3, column 6: 2), (4,4)=1 (row 4, column 4: 1), (4,5)=1 (row 4, column 5: 1), (4,6)=1 (row 4, column 6: 1). None of these are 0, but some are 1s and 2s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, row 4, column 12: row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 12 is '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 3, column 11: 1 (row 3, column 11: 1)\nrow 3, column 12: 1 (row 3, column 12: 1)\nrow 3, column 13: 1 (row 3, column 13: 1)\nrow 4, column 11: 2 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 13: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 11: row 5 is \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 11 is '?'\nrow 5, column 12: '?'\nrow 5, column 13: 2 (uncovered)\nCell (4,12) is adjacent to (4,11)=2. The 2 at (4,11) has adjacent cells: (3,10)=0, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,12)=?, (5,10)=?, (5,11)=?, (5,12)=?. The number is 2, so 2 mines in those adjacent cells. If there are 2 mines among (4,12), (5,10), (5,11), (5,12), but I don't know.\n\nThis is tricky. Maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that's in an area with many 0s, which are likely safe. For example, row 5, column 5 is 0, so surrounding areas are safe. But row 5, column 5 is 0, and its adjacent cells are all uncovered. So maybe row 5, column 9 is 1 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" → column 9 is 1). Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 4, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 9: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 4, column 10: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 5, column 10: '?'\nrow 6, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 9: 1 (uncovered)\nrow 6, column 10: 1 (uncovered)\nSo cell (5,9) is 1. It has 1 adjacent ?: (5,10). So (5,10) is a mine. So flag (5,10). But again, the user might need to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's a ? and not adjacent to any numbers. For example, row 0, column 16: '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 0, column 15: '?'\nrow 1, column 15: '?'\nrow 1, column 16: '?'\nSo no info. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best bet is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Wait, row 9, column 7: row 9 is \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" → column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells:\n\nrow 8, column 6: 0 (row 8, column 6: 0)\nrow 8, column 7: 0 (row 8, column 7: 0)\nrow 8, column 8: 0 (row 8, column 8: 0)\nrow 9, column 6: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 9, column 8: 0 (uncovered)\nrow 10, column 6: 1 (row 10, column 6: 1)\nrow 10, column 7: 1 (row 10, column 7: 1)\nrow 10, column 8: 2 (row 10, column 8: 2)\nAll adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Since the user has a lot of incorrect flags, maybe uncovering a safe cell is better. Let's pick a cell that's a ? and has a 0 in its adjacent cells. For example, row 3, column 5: let's check if it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 7: '?'. Adjacent cells include (2,6)=2, (1,8)=2, (3,6)=2. If those 2s have 2 mines each, and (2,7) is a common adjacent cell, maybe it's a mine. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's in a 0 area. For example, row 5, column 4 is 0, so the surrounding cells are safe. The cell (5,3) is 2 (row 5, column 3: 2). Adjacent to (5,3) are (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0. The 2 at (5,3) has 2 mines. Since (5,4) and (6,4) are 0, which are safe, the mines must be in (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So those three cells are mines. So flag them. But again, the user might have already flagged them.\n\nGiven that I need to output an action, and considering that the user has many incorrect flags, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. Let's choose a cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, row 4, column 7 is 0 (row 4, column 7: 0). Adjacent cells include (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. All uncovered. So no.\n\nAnother cell: row 7, column 8 is 0 (row 7, column 8: 0). Adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nI think I'll have to pick a cell that's a ? and not adjacent to any numbers, assuming it's safe. For example, row 0, column 16: '?'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, row 16, column 0: '?'. But without info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's a 1 with 1 adjacent ?, which must be a mine, and flag it. Earlier, I thought (8,13) is a mine. Let's confirm:\n\nCell (8,12) is 1 (row 8, column 12: 1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,11)=1 (safe)\n(7,12)=2 (safe)\n(7,13)=2 (safe)\n(8,11)=0 (safe)\n(8,13)=? (unknown)\n(9,11)=0 (safe)\n(9,12)=1 (safe)\n(9,13)=1 (safe)\nSo only (8,13) is unknown. Therefore, (8,13) must be a mine. So flag (8,13).\n\nBut the user's action could be to flag this. However, the problem requires to output an action in the format. So the answer would be 'Answer: flag (8,13)'. But wait, let's check the coordinates. Row 8, column 13. Let's confirm the row and column indices.\n\nRow 8 is \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\". The elements are:\n\n0: ?, 1: ?, 2: ?, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 0, 12: 1, 13: ?, 14: 1, 15: 0, 16: 0.\n\nYes, column 13 is '?'. So (8,13) is the cell. So flagging it would be correct.\n\n\n\nAnswer: flag (8,13)","flag (8,13)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided the current state, and I need to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell.\n\nFirst, let's recall the rules. The board is 9x9, but the current display here seems to have more rows? Wait, maybe the input is formatted with each row as a line. Let me check the current board lines. Each line has 17 characters, which is 9 columns? Wait, 9x9 should be 9 rows and 9 columns. Maybe the user made a formatting error, but perhaps each line represents a row. Let's count the rows: there are 17 lines. That can't be right. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but perhaps the actual board is 9x9, and the input is just split into lines with spaces. Let me check the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — that's 17 elements. That's not 9. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board representation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 17x17 board? But the problem statement says 9x9. Hmm, maybe it's a formatting error. Let's assume that perhaps the board is presented correctly, maybe each row is written with spaces between cells, and the user just pasted it with line breaks. Let's try to parse it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells, but the way it's written here is split into lines. Let's check: 9 rows, 9 columns. Let's see:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? — that's 17 elements. No, that's not 9. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps I should focus on the game logic.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10. Current score is ~0.103, which is 3\/29 (since 3\/29 ≈ 0.103). So they have 3 flags, 29 total flags (maybe 29 flagged cells?), but only 3 are correct. The unflags are 0.\n\nThe game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. So we need to make a move that helps towards winning.\n\nLooking at the board, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover. For example, cells with numbers that have adjacent '?' which can be determined.\n\nLet's take a row that has numbers. Let's look at row 8 (assuming rows start at 0). The last row in the current board is: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" — maybe row 16? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the rows are 0-8, and the current board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, and the line breaks are just for formatting. Let's take row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — perhaps this is row 0, columns 0-16. But that's 17 columns. This is confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 17x17 board, but the problem statement says 9x9. Maybe the input is incorrect, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is correctly formatted, and I need to find a cell that is safe to uncover. Let's look for cells marked with numbers and see if adjacent '?' can be determined.\n\nFor example, in a standard Minesweeper, a cell with '1' that has only one adjacent '?', that '?' must be a mine. But here, maybe we can find cells where the number of adjacent 'F's plus the number of adjacent '?' equals the number, meaning the '?' are safe.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells that are '0' — all adjacent cells are safe, so they can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — there's a '0' at (0,0), (0,1), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7). A '0' means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if a cell is '0', all adjacent '?' can be uncovered.\n\nFor example, (0,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). But (0,1) is already 0, (1,0) is 0 (from row 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — row 1, column 0 is 0). So (0,0) is 0, which is already uncovered. The 0s in the first row: (0,5) is 0. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,5) is 0, so adjacent cells (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6) should be safe. (0,4) is 2, (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. All these are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nLooking at row 8 (assuming the 9th line is row 8): \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" — (8,4) is 0. So adjacent cells (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) should be safe. (8,4) is 0, so those cells are safe. If any of those are '?', they can be uncovered. For example, (8,3) is 1 (row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 ...\"), so (8,3) is 1. (7,4) in row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" — (7,4) is 0. So (8,4) being 0 is consistent.\n\nAnother approach: look for '?' that are adjacent to multiple numbers, and see if their count can be determined.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has 3 correct flags out of 10, and 29 flags in total (which is way more than 10, so most flags are incorrect), perhaps unflagging some would help, but the problem says the current unflags are 0, so maybe the user hasn't unflagged any. But the instruction is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nBut the best move is usually to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '0' cell's adjacent '?'. For example, in row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" — (5,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (5,4) is 0, so those are safe. Let's check (5,5): 0. (5,3) is 2. (4,4) in row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — (4,4) is 1. (6,4) in row 6: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" — (6,4) is 0. So (5,4) is 0, so (4,5) (row 4, column 5) is 1 (from row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — wait, row 4 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — column 5 is 1. So (4,5) is 1, which is uncovered. So the adjacent cells of (5,4) are all uncovered except maybe some.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, in row 0, column 8 is 1, column 9 is '?', column 10 is 1. (0,8) is 1, so adjacent cells include (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (1,9)=?.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is too messy, and the best move is to uncover a cell that's likely safe. Since the game ends at 100 moves, and this is probably early, we need to uncover a safe cell.\n\nWait, another approach: in Minesweeper, when a cell is uncovered and shows 0, all adjacent cells are automatically uncovered. So if there's a 0, all adjacent '?' are safe. Let's look for 0s in the board and see their adjacent '?'.\n\nLooking at row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" — (8,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells: (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (8,4) is 0, so all these are safe. Let's check (9,4) in row 9: \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" — (9,4) is 1. (8,5) is 0 (row 8, column 5 is 0). (7,4) in row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" — (7,4) is 0. (8,3) is 1 (row 8, column 3 is 1). So (8,4) being 0 is okay.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 5: 0. (5,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6). (5,5) is 0, so these are safe. (4,5) is 1 (row 4, column 5 is 1), (5,4) is 0, (6,5) is 0 (row 6, column 5 is 0). (5,6) is 0 (row 5, column 6 is 0). So no '?' there.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 5: 0. (1,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), (2,6). (0,4) is 2, (0,5) is 0, (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2, (1,6) is 1, (2,4) is 2, (2,5) is 1, (2,6) is 2. All uncovered, no '?'.\n\nRow 2, column 11: 0. (2,11) is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,10), (1,11), (1,12), (2,10), (2,12), (3,10), (3,11), (3,12). (2,11) is 0, so these are safe. (1,11) is 0 (row 1, column 11 is 0), (2,10) is 1 (row 2, column 10 is 1), (3,11) is 1 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" — column 11 is 1). (3,12) is 1 (row 3, column 12 is 1). So (2,11) is 0, adjacent cells are safe.\n\nMaybe look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 1 where the number of adjacent F's is 1, so the rest are safe. For example, if a cell has a 1 and there's one F adjacent, then the other '?' are safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8: 1. (0,8) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (1,9)=?. The 1 at (0,8) means there's 1 mine in those 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7)=0 (safe), (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1 (safe, since it's a number), (1,8)=2 (safe), (1,9)=?, (0,8) is the cell itself, so the 8 adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (0,8-1=7), (0,8+1=9), (1,8-1=7), (1,8+1=9). Wait, 8 adjacent cells for (0,8) (assuming row 0, column 8) would be:\n\n(0,7), (0,9),\n\n(1,7), (1,8), (1,9).\n\nThat's 5 cells (since it's a corner). So (0,8) is 1, which means 1 mine in those 5 cells. (0,7)=0 (safe), (1,7)=1 (safe), (1,8)=2 (safe). So the possible mines are (0,9) and (1,9). So 1 mine in those two. So we can't be sure yet.\n\nAnother example: row 8, column 13 is F (row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\"). So (8,13) is flagged. Let's check the cell (8,12) which is 1. (8,12) is 1, adjacent cells include (8,13)=F, (7,12)=2 (row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\"), (7,13)=2, (8,11)=0, (9,12)=1 (row 9: \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\"), (9,13)=1. So (8,12)=1 has adjacent (8,13)=F. Since the cell is 1, that F could be the mine. So if (8,13) is a correct flag, then (8,12)'s 1 is satisfied. So other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, which means it's safe. For example, if there's a 0 cell, and a '?' next to it, that '?' can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (5,4)=0, so all adjacent are safe. Let's check (5,3) is 2 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\" — column 3 is 2). (6,3) is 2 (row 6: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" — column 3 is 2). (4,3) is 1 (row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — column 3 is 1). (4,4) is 1 (row 4, column 4 is 1). (4,5) is 1 (row 4, column 5 is 1). (5,5) is 0 (row 5, column 5 is 0). (6,4) is 0 (row 6, column 4 is 0). (6,5) is 0 (row 6, column 5 is 0). All these are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nLooking at row 7, column 4 is 0 (row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" — column 4 is 0). Adjacent cells: (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (7,4)=0, so these are safe. (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=2, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0. All uncovered, no '?'.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells as before, all uncovered.\n\nRow 9, column 5 is 0 (row 9: \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" — column 5 is 0). Adjacent cells: (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). (9,5)=0, so these are safe. (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0 (row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" — column 6 is 0), (9,4)=1, (9,6)=0 (row 9, column 6 is 0), (10,4)=2 (row 10: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — column 4 is 2), (10,5)=1 (row 10, column 5 is 1), (10,6)=1 (row 10, column 6 is 1). All uncovered.\n\nHmm, maybe look for a cell that is '?' and is in an area with many 0s, so it's likely safe. For example, in row 0, column 9 is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells. (0,9) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (0,8)=1, (0,10)=1, (1,8)=2, (1,9)=?, (1,10)=1. The cell (0,8)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,8)'s adjacent cells include (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (1,9)=?. So 1 mine in (0,9) and (1,9). The cell (0,10)=1 has adjacent cells (0,9)=?, (0,11)=0, (1,9)=?, (1,10)=1, (1,11)=0. (0,10)=1's adjacent cells: (0,9), (0,11)=0, (1,9), (1,10)=1, (1,11)=0. So 1 mine in (0,9) and (1,9). So both (0,8) and (0,10) are 1, and they both point to (0,9) and (1,9) as containing 1 mine each. So (0,9) and (1,9) must have exactly 1 mine between them. So we can't determine if (0,9) is a mine or not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that's in a corner with no adjacent numbers, which is more likely to be safe. But in Minesweeper, corners have fewer adjacent cells, so if there's a '?' in a corner and no adjacent numbers, it might be a mine, but it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has 29 flags, which is way more than the 10 mines, many of those flags are incorrect. So unflagging some might help, but the problem is to find the best action. However, the current score is 3\/10 (since 3 correct flags), and Flags: 3\/29, meaning 29 flagged cells, 3 correct. So 26 incorrect flags. Unflagging those could help, but how to know which ones?\n\nBut the user's action can be to uncover, flag, or unflag. Since the game ends at 100 moves, and this is probably early, uncovering a safe cell is better.\n\nAnother approach: look for a cell that is '?' and is adjacent to a 0. For example, if a '?' is next to a 0, it's safe. Let's check row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" — column 5 is '?'. Let's see adjacent cells. (3,5) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1. The cell (3,4)=1. (3,4)=1 has adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=?, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. So (3,4)=1 has 1 mine in those 8 cells. The adjacent cells: (2,3)=1 (safe), (2,4)=2 (safe), (2,5)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,5)=?, (4,3)=1 (safe), (4,4)=1 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe). So only (3,5) is '?', so (3,5) must be a mine. Wait, because (3,4)=1, and all other adjacent cells are uncovered (numbers), so the only '?' is (3,5), which must be the mine. So (3,5) should be flagged.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (3,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,3): row 2, column 3 is 1 (row 2: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" — column 3 is 1).\n\n(2,4): row 2, column 4 is 2.\n\n(2,5): row 2, column 5 is 1.\n\n(3,3): row 3, column 3 is 1 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" — column 3 is 1).\n\n(3,5): row 3, column 5 is '?'.\n\n(4,3): row 4, column 3 is 1 (row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — column 3 is 1).\n\n(4,4): row 4, column 4 is 1.\n\n(4,5): row 4, column 5 is 1.\n\nSo all adjacent cells of (3,4) except (3,5) are uncovered and are numbers (safe). Since (3,4) is 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are safe (since they are numbers, not mines), so the only possible mine is (3,5). Therefore, (3,5) is a mine and should be flagged.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the action should be to flag (3,5).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,5)","flag (3,5)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the rows are listed with spaces, so each row is a line. Let me parse the current board correctly. Wait, the current board has 18 rows? No, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the user probably made a mistake in formatting. Let me check again. Oh, maybe each line is a row of the 9x9 grid, but the way it's written is that each row's cells are separated by spaces. Let's count the cells per row. For example, the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – that's 17 cells, which is more than 9. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo, and the board is supposed to be 9x9. Let's see the original problem statement says the board is 9x9. So perhaps the current board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, and maybe the user split the rows incorrectly. Let's check the number of rows. The user lists 17 rows, which is way more than 9. That's confusing. Maybe it's a formatting error, but perhaps I should focus on the key information.\n\nThe score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29 (since 4\/29 ≈ 0.1379). So the user has flagged 4 mines, but there are 29 flags in total (since Flags: 4\/29). The unflags are 0, so all flags are still there. The win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100th epoch or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nThe goal is to choose an action: uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Let's look for safe cells to uncover. In Minesweeper, when a cell shows a number, that's the count of mines in adjacent cells. If a cell has a number equal to the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining adjacent unknown cells (marked as '?') are safe to uncover. Conversely, if a cell's number is equal to the number of adjacent '?' cells, then those '?' must be mines.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's take the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – wait, this can't be a 9x9 grid. Maybe the user pasted the board incorrectly, perhaps each line is a row but with extra spaces. Alternatively, maybe it's a 17x9 grid? No, the problem states 9x9. I think there's a mistake in the board presentation. But perhaps I can proceed by assuming that the board is 9x9 and the user made a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are separated by spaces, and each row has 9 cells. Let's check the first row again. Let's split by spaces: [\"0\", \"0\", \"2\", \"F\", \"2\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"?\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"?\", \"?\"]. That's 17 elements. That's way too long. Maybe the user intended each row to be 9 cells, but pasted them incorrectly. For example, maybe the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (9 cells), then the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" which is part of the next row? But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is presented correctly, and it's a larger grid, but the problem statement says 9x9. This is confusing. Maybe I should look for cells that are known (numbers or F) and see if there are obvious safe moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, and the board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's assume that. Let's count the lines: the user lists 17 lines. That's 17 rows, which is not 9. So perhaps it's a mistake. Given that, maybe I should focus on the flags. The user has 29 flags placed, but only 4 are correct (since score is 4\/10 = 0.4? Wait, the score is mines flagged correctly \/ total mines (10). The user's score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29? No, 4 divided by 29 is approximately 0.1379. Oh, the score is (correct flags) \/ (total mines). So 4 correct flags, total mines 10. So 4\/10 = 0.4 would be 0.4, but the user's score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29. So the score is (correct flags) \/ (total flags placed). Wait, the problem statement says: \"The final score is calculated as follows: the mines you flag correctly \/ total mines.\" Oh, right! So the score is (correct flags) \/ 10. So 0.1379 is 4\/29, but that's the flags: 4\/29. So the user has placed 29 flags, 4 of which are correct. So 4 correct mines flagged, 25 incorrect flags.\n\nThe win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines (so 10 correct flags, 0 incorrect) or uncover all safe cells (all non-mine cells uncovered). The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nSo, the user needs to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. Since there are 10 mines, and 81 cells total, there are 71 safe cells. If all 71 are uncovered, that's a win.\n\nNow, looking for safe cells to uncover. Let's look for cells that are '?', not flagged, and adjacent to numbered cells where the number of adjacent flags equals the number, so the remaining '?' are safe.\n\nFor example, consider a cell with number 2, and adjacent to it there are 2 flags. Then the other adjacent '?' cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, a cell with number 0: all adjacent cells are safe (but 0s are already uncovered, so their adjacent cells would have been automatically uncovered in Minesweeper's cascading reveal).\n\nBut in the current board, there are '0's, which means their adjacent cells have no mines, so those adjacent cells would have been uncovered. So if a cell is '0', all 8 adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered. If the current board shows a '0', then all adjacent cells are already uncovered (assuming standard Minesweeper rules where uncovering a 0 reveals all adjacent cells, which in turn may reveal more 0s, etc.). So if there's a '0' in the board, the adjacent cells are not '?'.\n\nLooking at the first line (assuming it's a row): \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – maybe the '0's here have adjacent cells that are already uncovered, so the '?' cells are not adjacent to 0s. Let's think of a possible cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is a number, and the number of adjacent flags is equal to the number. For example, if a cell shows '1', and there's 1 flag adjacent to it, then the other adjacent '?' cells are safe.\n\nSuppose in the current board, there's a cell with value '1' that has 1 adjacent flag. Then the remaining '?' cells around it are safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, a cell with value '2' and 2 adjacent flags: the rest are safe.\n\nLet's look for such a scenario. Let's assume the board is 9x9, and the rows are listed correctly. Let's take the last row provided: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – maybe that's row 16 (but 9x9 should have rows 0-8). This is getting too confusing. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board format, but I need to make a best guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the flags. The user has 29 flags, which is way more than the 10 mines. So most flags are incorrect. So unflagging incorrect flags might help, but the problem is to find which ones are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, look for cells that are flagged (F) but are adjacent to a 0. Since a 0 means no adjacent mines, any flagged cell adjacent to a 0 is definitely incorrect and should be unflagged.\n\nFor example, if there's a 0 in the board, and an adjacent cell is flagged (F), that F is a mistake because 0 means no mines around. So unflag that.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's take the first row (assuming it's a row): \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". The '0's here: if a cell is 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So any F adjacent to a 0 is a wrong flag.\n\nSuppose there's a 0 at (0,0). Then the adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) should be safe. If any of those are flagged, they're wrong.\n\nBut given the confusion in the board format, perhaps the best approach is to look for a cell that is a '0' and has adjacent 'F's, then unflag those. But since the user's unflags are 0, maybe they haven't unflagged any yet.\n\nAlternatively, look for a '?' cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell with number '1' has 1 adjacent flag, then the other '?' cells around it are safe.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has many incorrect flags, maybe unflagging some of them is a good move. But without knowing where the mines are, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, pick a '?' cell that is likely safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0s are safe, but 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered. So 0s are surrounded by numbers or uncovered cells.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that is a number, and the number of adjacent '?' cells equals the number. For example, a cell with '2' and 2 '?' adjacent cells: those '?' must be mines. So flag them.\n\nBut given the high number of flags (29), maybe the user has over-flagged, so unflagging is better. But the problem requires an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's assume that the board has a cell that is a number, and the number of adjacent flags is equal to the number, so the remaining '?' cells are safe to uncover.\n\nFor example, suppose a cell shows '1', and there's 1 adjacent flag. Then the other adjacent '?' cells are safe. Let's imagine such a scenario.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the last row: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\". The '0's here: (row, col) where the value is 0. Let's say (16,13) is 0. Then adjacent cells (15,12), (15,13), (15,14), (16,12), (16,14), (17,12), (17,13), (17,14) are safe. If any of those are flagged, they should be unflagged. But without knowing the exact coordinates, it's hard.\n\nGiven the confusion in the board layout, perhaps the best move is to uncover a '?' cell that is not adjacent to any numbers, or is adjacent to a 0. But since 0s' adjacent cells are already uncovered, maybe look for a cell that's in a corner or edge with no adjacent numbers, which is likely safe.\n\nAlternatively, the user has a score of 4\/10 (since 4 correct flags), so 4 mines are correctly flagged, 6 left. To win, they need to flag all 10. But with 29 flags, 25 are wrong. So unflagging wrong flags could help, but how?\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is flagged (F) but is adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (0,1), then (0,0) is adjacent. If (0,0) is flagged, that's a wrong flag. So unflag (0,0).\n\nBut given the board as presented, let's take the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". Let's split this into cells. Suppose the first row is (row 0) with columns 0-8:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\n\nRow 1: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] – but that's only 8 cells. This is too ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is presented as a single line with 9x9=81 cells, separated by spaces. Let's count the total number of cells. The user's current board has lines:\n\nLine 1: 17 cells\n\nLine 2: 17 cells\n\n...\n\nLine 17: 17 cells. That's 17*17=289 cells, which is way more than 81. So definitely a formatting error.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that is a '?' and not adjacent to any numbers, assuming it's safe. For example, the top-left corner (0,0) if it's '?', but in the first line, there's a '0' at (0,0). So (0,0) is uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, look for a '?' cell in a region with many 0s, which are safe. For example, if there's a 0 at (5,5), then adjacent cells are safe. But without knowing the board, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, since the user has 29 flags, which is way over the 10 mines, they need to unflag incorrect ones. Let's find a flagged cell (F) that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if a cell is F and adjacent to a 0, then it's a wrong flag. So unflag it.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". Suppose the third cell is 2, then the fourth is F. If the 2 is at (0,2), then adjacent cells include (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,2), (1,3), etc. The 2 at (0,2) has a flag at (0,3). The number 2 means there are 2 mines adjacent. If (0,3) is a mine (flagged correctly), then there's 1 more mine adjacent to (0,2). But (0,1) is 0, which has no adjacent mines, so (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1)=0, which is safe. So (0,2) has adjacent cells: (0,1)=0 (safe), (0,3)=F (mine?), (1,1)=0 (from row 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – maybe row 1, column 1 is 0). So (0,2) is adjacent to (0,1)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (1,4)=2, (0,5)=0. So the 2 at (0,2) has adjacent flags at (0,3) and (1,3). If those are both flags, then the 2 would mean there are 2 mines there, which could be correct. But if the 2 is supposed to have 2 mines, and there are 2 flags there, then that's correct. But if there are more flags, then they're wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best move is to uncover a '?' cell that is in a region with low numbers. For example, a '?' adjacent to a 1, where there are no flags yet, so it's safe.\n\nBut given the uncertainty in the board layout, I'll have to make a guess. Let's pick a cell that is '?' and not flagged, and likely safe. For example, let's say (3,4) is a cell that's '1' (from the fourth row: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" – maybe (3,4) is 1). If (3,4) is 1, and adjacent to it there are no flags, then the '?' cells around it might be safe. Alternatively, maybe (3,4) is a '1' with no adjacent flags, so the adjacent '?' cells could be safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the last row: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – the 0s here are at the end. So (row 16, 13) is 0, (row 16,14)=0, (row 16,15)=0, (row 16,16)=0. The cell (row 16,12) is 1. The 0s at (16,13-16) mean their adjacent cells are safe. So (15,12-17) are safe. If (15,12) is '?', then uncovering (15,12) is safe.\n\nBut without the correct board layout, it's impossible to know. Given that, I'll have to make a best guess. Let's assume that there's a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0, so it's safe. For example, (5,5) is 0, so (5,6) is '?', so uncover (5,6).\n\nAlternatively, pick a cell that's in a corner. Let's say (8,8) is '?', uncover that.\n\nBut the user's example action is 'uncover (3,4)'. Maybe (3,4) is a safe cell. Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is based on correct flags divided by total mines, which is 10. The user has 4 flags out of 29, but only the correct ones count. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to find a cell that's safe to uncover. Let's start by analyzing the known numbers and flagged cells.\n\nFirst, let's note the coordinates. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0 to 16? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the user probably pasted the board incorrectly. Wait, the problem says the board is 9x9, so maybe the current board is written as 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let me check the input again. The current board is listed as:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? — Wait, that's more than 9 cells. Oh, maybe there's a mistake in the formatting. Alternatively, perhaps each line is a row, and the numbers are separated by spaces. Let's assume that the board is 9 rows, each with 9 columns. Maybe the user made a typo in the board display. Let's try to parse it properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces. Let's count the number of elements per row. Let's check row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — that's 17 elements. That can't be 9x9. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps the actual board is 9x9, and the user input has a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the rows are concatenated. This is confusing.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the board is 9x9, so let's focus on that. Let's ignore the possible formatting error and think of the standard 9x9 grid. Let's look for cells that are marked with numbers and their adjacent cells.\n\nFor example, if a cell shows a number 'n', it means there are 'n' mines in the 8 surrounding cells. Flagged cells (F) are assumed to be mines by the player. So, if a cell with number 1 has only one adjacent '?' cell, then that '?' must be a mine, and we can flag it. Conversely, if a cell with number 1 has an adjacent F, then the other adjacent '?' cells are safe.\n\nLet's look for such patterns. Let's take row 3 (assuming rows start at 0). The row is: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" — but again, this is more than 9. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Alternatively, perhaps each line is a row, and the numbers are separated by spaces, but the actual 9x9 grid is represented with some rows split. Alternatively, maybe it's a 17x17 grid, but the problem states 9x9. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is a 9x9 grid, and the way it's displayed is each row's cells are listed, but the user made a mistake in the number of cells per row. Let's assume that each row has 9 cells, and the extra characters are typos. For example, row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (first 9 cells). Then row 1: \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — no, that's not matching. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is presented correctly, and the 9x9 grid is 9 rows each with 9 columns, but the way it's written is that each row is split into parts. For example, row 0 might be \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (columns 0-8), then the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" which is row 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nGiven that the problem is to output an action, perhaps the best approach is to look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, if a cell with a number 0 is uncovered, all adjacent cells are safe. But in the current board, there are 0s. Let's assume that in row 0, the first few cells are 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1. So (0,0) is 0, (0,1) is 0, (0,2) is 2, (0,3) is F (flagged), (0,4) is 2, (0,5) is 0, (0,6) is 0, (0,7) is 0, (0,8) is 1.\n\nA cell with 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So (0,0) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1) is already 0, which is uncovered. (1,0) and (1,1) — if those are '?', then they can be uncovered safely. Let's check row 1. If row 1 is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\", then (1,0) is 0, (1,1) is 0. So those are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 cell: (0,5) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. (0,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (0,6) is 0 (already uncovered), (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). So no new cells there.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\" — (4,7) is 0, (4,8) is 0. A 0 in (4,7) means all adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Let's see: (4,7) is 0. (4,8) is 0 (already uncovered). (3,7) in row 3: if row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\", then (3,7) is 1 (uncovered). (5,7) in row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" — (5,7) is 0 (uncovered). (5,8) is 0 (uncovered). (4,6) is 1 (uncovered). (3,6) is 2 (uncovered). (3,8) is 1 (uncovered). (5,6) is 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" — (5,6) is 0). So (4,7) being 0 doesn't reveal new cells.\n\nAnother 0: (5,5) is 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\"). Adjacent cells: (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=2, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All these are either uncovered or 0, so no new cells.\n\nLooking for a cell with a number and adjacent '?'. For example, (0,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 2: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2\" — (2,7) is '?'. The cell (2,6) is 2. Let's check (2,6)=2. Its adjacent cells: (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1. So (2,6)=2. The adjacent cells with possible mines: (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F (flagged). So 2 mines here. If (3,5) is a correct flag, then (2,7) must be safe (since 2-1=1, but wait, (2,6)=2. The F at (3,5) is one mine, so there's one more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,5)=0 (safe), (1,6)=1 (safe), (1,7)=1 (safe), (2,5)=1 (safe), (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F, (3,6)=2 (safe), (3,7)=1 (safe). So the only unknown is (2,7). So if (3,5) is a correct mine, then (2,7) must be a mine (since 2 mines needed: F and (2,7)). But we don't know if (3,5) is a correct flag. The user has 4 flags, but maybe some are incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's '?' and has a neighboring 0. For example, if there's a 0 cell, all adjacent '?' can be uncovered. Let's check row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\". (8,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0. All these are uncovered except maybe (7,3), (8,3), (9,3). But (8,4)=0, so (8,3) is 1 (uncovered), (7,4)=0 (uncovered), (8,5)=0 (uncovered). So (8,4) being 0 doesn't help with new '?' cells.\n\nAnother approach: the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, as 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. Let's find a 0 cell and see if any of its adjacent cells are '?'. For example, (0,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. All are uncovered. (1,5)=0: adjacent cells (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 7 is 0: (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 5 is 0: (5,5)=0. Adjacent cells (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=2, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0: (6,5)=0. Adjacent cells (5,4)=2, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=2, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is 0: (7,4)=0. Adjacent cells (6,3)=2, (6,4)=2, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=2, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 0: (8,4)=0. Adjacent cells (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=0, (9,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a 0 cell that I'm missing. Let's check row 0, column 0: 0. Adjacent cells (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nWhat about cells with number 1 that have only one adjacent '?'. For example, (0,8)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered, so no. (1,8)=2. Adjacent cells (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2. So (1,8)=2. The adjacent cells: (2,7)=? and maybe others. Let's count: (0,7)=0 (safe), (0,8)=1 (safe), (1,7)=1 (safe), (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2 (safe). So (1,8)=2 has one '?' cell (2,7). So if there are 2 mines here, but the other cells are safe, then (2,7) must be a mine. But we don't know. Alternatively, if (2,7) is a mine, then (1,8)=2 is satisfied. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' cell that is not adjacent to any numbers, which are likely safe. For example, cells in the top-left where there are many '?'. Wait, the board has a lot of '?', but maybe some are in areas with 0s. Alternatively, the safest move is to uncover a cell that is in a corner with many 0s. For example, the top-left corner has (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0. The adjacent cells to these 0s are all uncovered, so the next layer might be safe. But if all adjacent to 0s are uncovered, then maybe the '?' cells further away are safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and has no adjacent numbers (i.e., all adjacent cells are 0 or uncovered). For example, if a '?' is surrounded by 0s, then it's safe. Let's say there's a '?' at (x,y) where all 8 adjacent cells are 0. Then (x,y) is safe. Let's check.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" — (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1.\n\nRow 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\" — (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2.\n\nRow 2: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2\" — (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\" — (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=F, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1.\n\nRow 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\" — (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=0.\n\nRow 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" — (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=2, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0.\n\nRow 6: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" — (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0.\n\nRow 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" — (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0.\n\nRow 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\" — (8,0)=?, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0.\n\nNow, let's check (3,4) which is 1. Its adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. So (3,4)=1. The adjacent cells have (3,5)=F (flagged). So if (3,5) is a mine, then the other adjacent cells should have 0 mines. Let's count: (3,4)=1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,5)=F is a mine, so the other 7 adjacent cells must be safe. So (2,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,4)=2 (uncovered), (2,5)=1 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered), (4,3)=1 (uncovered), (4,4)=1 (uncovered), (4,5)=1 (uncovered). All are uncovered, so (3,4)=1 is satisfied if (3,5) is a mine. So (3,5) being flagged is correct here. So that's one correct flag.\n\nAnother example: (0,3)=F and (1,3)=F. Let's check (0,2)=2. (0,2)=2 has adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So (0,2)=2. The adjacent F cells are (0,3) and (1,3). So 2 mines here, which matches the 2. So (0,3) and (1,3) are likely correct flags. That's two more correct flags, bringing the total to 3 (assuming (3,5) is correct). The user has 4 flags, so one more.\n\nNow, let's look for a '?' cell that is safe. For example, (3,0) is '?'. Let's see its adjacent cells. (3,0) is in row 3, column 0. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. The cell (2,0)=1 has adjacent cells: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=1, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (2,2)=2. So (2,0)=1: needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,0)=0 (safe), (1,1)=0 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (2,1)=1 (safe), (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (2,2)=2 (safe). So (2,0)=1 has two '?' cells: (3,0) and (3,1). So there's 1 mine between them. Similarly, (2,1)=1: adjacent cells (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. So (2,1)=1 also has two '?' cells: (3,0) and (3,1). So (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1 both require 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1). That means exactly one of (3,0) or (3,1) is a mine. So we can't be sure, so those are risky.\n\nHow about (4,0): '?'. Adjacent cells: (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?. No numbers here, so hard to tell.\n\nWhat about (8,0): '?'. Adjacent cells: (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (7,2)=?, (8,1)=?, (8,2)=?, (9,0)=? (but row 9 doesn't exist, since it's 9x9, rows 0-8). So (8,0) is in the bottom-left corner. Its adjacent cells are (7,0), (7,1), (8,1). All are '?'. No numbers nearby, so risky.\n\nLet's look for a cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, (5,8)=0. Its adjacent cells: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=0, (5,7)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0. All are 0, so (5,8) is 0, and its adjacent cells are all 0. So any cell adjacent to (5,8) is safe, but they are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 cell: (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nWhat about (2,7)=? (row 2, column 7). Let's check its adjacent cells. (2,7) is in row 2, column 7. Adjacent cells: (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,8)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1. So (2,7) is surrounded by numbers. Let's see (2,6)=2: adjacent cells (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1. So (2,6)=2 has one F (3,5) and one '?' (2,7). So 2 mines here, which would mean (3,5) and (2,7) are mines. If (3,5) is a correct flag, then (2,7) is a mine. But if (3,5) is incorrect, then (2,7) might be safe. But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's '?' and has a neighboring cell with a number equal to the number of adjacent flags. For example, if a cell shows 'n' and has 'n' adjacent flags, then all other adjacent '?' are safe. Let's take (0,4)=2. Its adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. So (0,4)=2 has two adjacent flags: (0,3) and (1,3). So 2 flags, which matches the number 2. Therefore, all other adjacent cells (which are (0,5)=0, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1) are safe. So (0,4)=2 is satisfied, so no need to flag more there.\n\nAnother example: (1,4)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. Again, two flags (0,3 and 1,3), so 2 mines. So (1,4)=2 is satisfied.\n\n(3,6)=2. Adjacent cells: (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=0. So (3,6)=2. The adjacent F is (3,5). So 1 flag. So there should be 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (2,5)=1 (safe), (2,6)=2 (safe), (2,7)=? (unknown), (3,7)=1 (safe), (4,5)=1 (safe), (4,6)=1 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe). So the only unknown is (2,7). So (3,6)=2 requires (2,7) to be a mine (since 1 flag + 1 mine = 2). So (2,7) is a mine. Therefore, we can flag (2,7), but the user might not have enough flags, but the current action is to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, since (3,4)=1 and its adjacent (3,5)=F, and (3,4)=1 is satisfied, then (3,4) is safe. Wait, (3,4) is already uncovered (it's 1). So maybe look for a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 1 with all other adjacent cells safe.\n\nLet's take (4,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=?, (4,4)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=2, (5,4)=0. So (4,3)=1. The adjacent cells: (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (4,2)=?, (4,4)=1 (safe), (5,2)=?, (5,3)=2 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe). So (4,3)=1 has two '?' cells: (4,2) and (5,2). So there's 1 mine between them. Not helpful.\n\nHow about (5,3)=2. Adjacent cells: (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (5,2)=?, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0. So (5,3)=2 has three '?' cells: (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So 2 mines among them. Not sure.\n\nAnother angle: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we need to make moves until then. The safest move is to uncover a cell that is in an area with many 0s, as those are likely safe. For example, the bottom-right corner has (8,8)=0, (8,7)=0, (7,8)=0, etc. Let's check (8,8)=0. Its adjacent cells are (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0, (8,7)=0. All uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 0: (8,0) is '?'. Its adjacent cells are (7,0)=?, (7,1)=?, (8,1)=?, and (7,0), (7,1), (8,1) are all '?'. No numbers nearby, so risky.\n\nRow 3, column 0: (3,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. (2,0)=1 and (2,1)=1 both need 1 mine in their adjacent cells, which are (3,0) and (3,1). So one of them is a mine, so uncovering either is risky.\n\nRow 4, column 0: (4,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?. No numbers except (3,2)=2. (3,2)=2 has adjacent cells (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (4,3)=1. So (3,2)=2 has two '?' cells: (3,1) and (4,1), (4,2). So 2 mines there. Not helpful.\n\nWhat about (2,7)=? We thought earlier it might be a mine, but if we uncover it, we might hit a mine. So avoid that.\n\nLet's look for a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, (5,4)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=2, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nAnother 0: (6,4)=0. Adjacent cells (5,3)=2, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=2, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nHow about (7,3)=2. Adjacent cells (6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=?, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0. So (7,3)=2 has three '?' cells: (6,2), (7,2), (8,2). So 2 mines among them. Not sure.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell in the top-left '?' area. For example, (0,9) but wait, it's 9x9, so columns 0-8. So (0,8) is 1. The next '?' cells are probably in row 3, column 0 or 1, but they are risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and has a neighboring cell with number 0. For example, (5,7)=0. Its adjacent cells are (4,6)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nI think I need to pick a cell that is likely safe. Let's try (3,4). Wait, (3,4) is 1, already uncovered. Oh, no. Let's check the current board again. The user's current board has a lot of '?', so maybe the best move is to uncover a '?' cell that is in a region with many 0s. For example, (5,0) is '?'. Let's see its adjacent cells: (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=?. No numbers, so risky.\n\nAlternatively, (8,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (7,2)=?, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=0, (9,2)=? (invalid), (9,3)=1 (invalid), (9,4)=0 (invalid). So (8,3)=1 has two '?' cells: (7,2) and (8,2). So 1 mine between them. Uncovering either is risky.\n\nWait, maybe (3,4) is a typo. Let me check the initial problem statement. The user provided the current board as:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\n\nRow 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\n\nRow 2: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\n\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\n\nRow 4: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 5: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\n\nRow 8: ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\n\nRow 9: ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 10: ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1\n\nRow 13: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\n\nRow 14: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 15: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 16: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n\nAh, I see! The user made a mistake in the problem statement. The board is actually 17x17, not 9x9. That explains the row count. The initial problem statement said 9x9, but the current board has 17 rows. That's a mistake. But given that, we have to work with the 17x17 board.\n\nNow, the coordinates are (row, col), with (0,0) being top-left. Let's focus on the current board. Let's look for a cell that is '?' and can be safely uncovered.\n\nLet's take row 8, column 13: \"1 F 1 0 0\". So (8,13)=F. Let's check a cell with a number that has adjacent flags. For example, row 13, column 11: \"? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\". So (13,11)=3. Its adjacent cells: let's list them. (13,11)=3 means 3 mines in the 8 surrounding cells.\n\nAdjacent cells to (13,11):\n\n(12,10), (12,11), (12,12),\n\n(13,10),         (13,12),\n\n(14,10), (14,11), (14,12).\n\nLooking at row 12: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1\" — so (12,10)=?, (12,11)=?, (12,12)=?.\n\nRow 13: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\" — (13,10)=?, (13,12)=2.\n\nRow 14: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" — (14,10)=?, (14,11)=1, (14,12)=0.\n\nSo (13,11)=3 has adjacent cells:\n\n(12,10)=?, (12,11)=?, (12,12)=?,\n\n(13,10)=?, (13,12)=2,\n\n(14,10)=?, (14,11)=1, (14,12)=0.\n\nThe known cells here are (13,12)=2 (safe), (14,11)=1 (safe), (14,12)=0 (safe). The rest are '?'. So 3 mines in the 5 '?' cells: (12,10), (12,11), (12,12), (13,10), (14,10). Not helpful.\n\nAnother example: row 8, column 13 is F. Let's check row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\". So (8,13)=F. The cell (8,12)=1. (8,12)=1 has adjacent cells: (7,11)=1, (7,12)=2, (7,13)=2, (8,11)=0, (8,13)=F, (9,11)=0, (9,12)=1, (9,13)=1. So (8,12)=1. The adjacent F is (8,13). So 1 mine here, which matches the 1. So (8,13)=F is a correct flag. That's one correct flag.\n\nRow 0, column 3 is F: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". (0,3)=F. The cell (0,2)=2. (0,2)=2 has adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So (0,2)=2 has two Fs: (0,3) and (1,3). So 2 mines, which matches the 2. So (0,3) and (1,3)=F are correct flags. That's two more.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is F: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\". (3,5)=F. The cell (3,4)=1. (3,4)=1 has adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. So (3,4)=1 has one F: (3,5). So 1 mine, which matches. So (3,5)=F is correct. That's the fourth correct flag (since user has 4 flags). So all 4 flags are correct so far (0.4 score, but the given score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29, but that's probably a mistake. Anyway, focus on the move).\n\nNow, let's look for a '?' cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 4, columns 7-8: \"1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" — (4,7)=0, (4,8)=0. So (4,7)=0. Its adjacent cells are (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=2, (5,8)=0. So (4,7)=0. Since it's 0, all adjacent cells are safe. (5,6)=? is adjacent to (4,7)=0, so (5,6) is safe. Therefore, we can uncover (5,6).\n\nLet's verify: (4,7)=0 means no mines in adjacent cells. (5,6) is adjacent to (4,7)=0, so (5,6) is safe. Yes, that's a safe move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the rows are listed with 17 elements each? Wait, maybe that's a formatting mistake. Wait, the user probably pasted the board rows incorrectly. Let me check again. Oh, the user wrote \"Current Board:\" followed by lines with 17 elements each, but Minesweeper is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Maybe it's a typo, perhaps each line is a row of 9 cells, but the numbers are separated by spaces, and maybe some lines are split. Let me count the elements in the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 17 elements. That can't be right. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Alternatively, maybe it's a 17x9 grid? No, the problem states it's 9x9. Hmm, perhaps it's a mistake, but I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Current Board\" is presented with each row as a line, but each row has 9 cells. Let's check the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" — that's 9 elements, then \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — that's another 8. Maybe it's a formatting error where the rows are split into two parts. Maybe the actual rows are 9 cells each. Let's assume that each line is split into two parts. For example, the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (cells 0-8), then the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" which might be a continuation, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps the key is to look for safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nThe score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29 (since 4\/29 ≈ 0.1379). So total flags are 29, but only 4 are correct. The win condition is to correctly flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or uncovering a mine.\n\nLooking at the board, let's look for cells with 'F' which are flagged. Let's check each row for 'F's.\n\nFirst row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — there's an F at position (0,3).\n\nSecond row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — F at (1,3).\n\nThird row: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" — no F here.\n\nFourth row: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" — F at (3,5).\n\nEighth row: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" — F at (8,13). Wait, but if the grid is 9x9, columns 0-8. So (8,13) is out of bounds. So definitely, the board formatting is messed up. Maybe the user intended each row to be 9 cells, but the way it's written is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's a 17x9 grid, but that's not standard.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is a mistake, and the actual board is 9x9, with rows as follows (each row has 9 cells):\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\n\nRow 1: ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? (No, that's 8 cells). This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in pasting the board, but perhaps the key is to find a cell that is safe to uncover. Let's think about standard Minesweeper logic. If a cell shows a number, it indicates the number of mines in adjacent cells. For example, if a cell has '0', all adjacent cells are safe, so they can be uncovered automatically.\n\nAssuming that some of the cells are uncovered (numbers), some are flagged (F), and some are unknown (?). The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines.\n\nSince the score is based on correctly flagged mines (4\/10 so far, since 4 correct out of 10 total), but the user has 29 flags (so 25 are incorrect). The game ends at 100 moves, so we need to make moves that either uncover safe cells or correctly flag mines.\n\nLooking for cells that are definitely safe. For example, if a cell with a number has all its adjacent unknown cells equal to the number, then those unknowns are mines. Or if the number of adjacent flags equals the number, then the remaining unknowns are safe.\n\nAlternatively, if a cell is '0', all adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover them.\n\nLet's assume that in the current board, there's a cell that's a '0' which has adjacent '?' cells. For example, looking at the first row (assuming 9 cells): \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\". The '0's here mean their adjacent cells are safe. Let's take the cell (0,0) which is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). If those are '?', then they can be uncovered safely. But if they are already uncovered (like (0,1) is 0, (1,0) might be 0, etc.), then maybe there's another 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell with a number where the number of adjacent flags is equal to the number, so the remaining adjacent '?' are safe. For example, if a cell shows '2' and has 2 adjacent 'F's, then the other adjacent '?' are safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\". Let's take (0,2) which is 2. Adjacent cells include (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F. So (0,2) has two F's adjacent (at (0,3) and (1,3)), so the number is 2, which matches the number of F's. That means the other adjacent cells (like (1,2)) are safe. Wait, but (1,2) is 2, which is already uncovered. Maybe another example.\n\nFourth row: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\". Let's take (3,5)=F (flagged). The cell (3,4) is 1. The adjacent cells to (3,4) would be (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,5) is F, so if (3,4) is 1, then there's 1 mine adjacent. If (3,5) is a mine (flagged), then the other adjacent cells are safe. So (3,4) has 1 mine, which is (3,5), so the rest are safe. Therefore, cells like (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are safe. If any of those are '?', we can uncover them.\n\nAlternatively, looking for cells that are '?' and adjacent to a 0, which are safe. For example, if a cell is 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if there's a 0 with adjacent '?', those '?' can be uncovered.\n\nAssuming the board has a 0 in some row, say row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\". The cell (5,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If any of these are '?', they are safe. For example, (5,3) is 2, (5,5) is 0, (6,4) is 0, (6,5) is 0. Maybe (4,4) is 1 (from row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\"). So (4,4)=1. So (5,4)=0's adjacent cells are mostly uncovered, but maybe (4,3) is '?', which would be safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 1, and the 1 has only one adjacent '?', which would be a mine. But since we need to maximize correct flags, but the user has 29 flags already (many incorrect), maybe better to uncover safe cells.\n\nThe best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's assume that in row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\". If (8,4) is 0, then adjacent cells (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) are safe. If (8,5) is 0, then (8,6) is 0, etc. Maybe (8,4) is 0, so (8,3) is 1, which is already uncovered. So perhaps (8,5) is 0, adjacent to (8,6)=0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell (5,4) is 0, so (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. So any '?' adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered.\n\nBut given the confusion in the board formatting, perhaps the best approach is to find a cell that is marked as '?' and is adjacent to a 0, which is safe. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, the adjacent '?' cells are safe to uncover. Let's say in row 5, column 4 is 0. Then (5,5) is 0, (5,6) is 0, (5,7) is 0, (5,8) is 0. So if (5,9) is '?', but that's out of bounds. Maybe (4,5) is 1 (from row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\"), so (4,5)=1. The adjacent cells to (4,5) are (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6). (3,5) is F, (4,4)=1, (4,6)=1, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. So (4,5)=1 has one mine (the F at (3,5)), so the rest are safe. Therefore, any '?' adjacent to (4,5) that's not the F is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's likely safe. Since the user has many incorrect flags, maybe uncovering a cell that's adjacent to a 0 is the way to go. Let's assume that (5,4) is 0, so (5,3) is 2, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. The cell (5,2) is '?', but (5,3)=2. Maybe (6,4)=0, so (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0, etc.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' in a row where there's a 0. For example, row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\". If (5,4)=0, then (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. So (5,9) is 1, which is a number, but (5,9) is out of 9x9. Maybe the actual row is 9 cells, so (5,4)=0, and (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. So any '?' adjacent to these 0s would be safe. For example, (4,8) is 0 (from row 4: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\"), so (4,8)=0. Its adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (4,7)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. So (3,7) and (3,8) might be '?', which are safe. If (3,7) is '?', then uncovering (3,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\". If (3,5)=F, and (3,4)=1, then (3,4) has 1 mine, which is (3,5), so the adjacent cells to (3,4) are safe. (3,4) is (row 3, column 4). Adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (3,5)=F, so the rest are safe. If any of these are '?', like (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), etc., they can be uncovered.\n\nAssuming (3,3) is '?', then uncovering (3,3) is safe. But I need to check the coordinates. The problem states the top-left is (0,0), so rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nGiven the confusion in the board display, perhaps the best move is to pick a cell that is a '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (5,4), then (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, etc., so (5,9) is out of bounds, but (4,5) is 1. Maybe (4,8) is 0, so (4,8) is (row 4, column 8). Its adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (4,7)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. If (3,7) is '?', then (3,7) is safe. So the action would be 'uncover (3,7)'.\n\nAlternatively, looking at row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\". If (8,4)=0, then (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Adjacent cells to (8,4) are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3)=1, (8,5)=0, (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). If (7,4) is 0, then (7,4) is safe. Maybe (7,5)=0, so (7,5) is safe.\n\nBut without a clear board, it's hard. Alternatively, the user might have a typo, and the board is 17 rows, but that's not standard. Given the input, perhaps the best guess is to uncover a cell that's a '?' and adjacent to a 0. Let's say (5,9) is a typo, and the actual cell is (5,4)=0, so (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, etc. So (5,9) is not a valid cell. Maybe the correct move is to uncover (5,9) but that's invalid. Alternatively, the user made a mistake, and the board is 9x9, with each row having 9 cells. Let's take the first 9 cells of each row:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\n\nRow 1: ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? (No, 8 cells). This is too confusing. Maybe the answer is to uncover (3,4), which is in the fourth row (row 3) and column 4. Let's check row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\". If (3,4) is 1 (since columns 0-8, (3,4) is the fifth element), then (3,4)=1. Adjacent cells include (3,5)=F (flagged mine). So (3,4)=1 has 1 mine adjacent (the F), so the other adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (3,4) is already uncovered (it's a 1). So maybe (3,3) is '?', which is adjacent to (3,4)=1. Since (3,4)=1 has one mine (F at (3,5)), then (3,3) is safe. So uncover (3,3).\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' in a row with a 0. For example, row 5: first 9 cells: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\". So (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. The cell (5,3)=2. The adjacent cells to (5,4)=0 are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (5,3)=2, (5,5)=0, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. If (4,3) is '?', then (4,3) is safe. So uncover (4,3).\n\nBut without a clear board, it's hard. Given the input, perhaps the best move is to uncover (3,4), but (3,4) is 1, which is already uncovered. Maybe (3,4) is a typo. Alternatively, the user's example input has 'uncover (3,4)', so maybe that's the answer. But I need to think.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the flags. The user has 29 flags, 4 correct. So most flags are wrong. So unflagging might help, but the problem says to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag. The user has 0 unflags, so maybe unflagging a wrong flag is good. But how to know which is a wrong flag. For example, if a cell is flagged (F) but is adjacent to a 0, it's a wrong flag. Because a 0 means no adjacent mines, so any F adjacent to a 0 is a wrong flag.\n\nLooking for F's adjacent to 0. For example, row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\". The F is at (0,3). The cell (0,4)=2, (0,2)=2, (1,3)=F (second row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\"). So (1,3)=F. The cell (0,1)=0. The adjacent cells to (0,1)=0 are (0,0)=0, (0,2)=2, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2. So (0,1)=0 has no adjacent mines, so any F in its adjacent cells is wrong. (0,1) is at (0,1). Adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). None of these are F. The F is at (0,3), which is adjacent to (0,2)=2 and (1,2)=2. So (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=2 and (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F. The cell (0,2)=2 has two adjacent F's (0,3 and 1,3). So if (0,2)=2, and there are two F's adjacent, that's correct. So those F's might be correct.\n\nAnother F is at (3,5) (fourth row: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\"). The cell (3,4)=1, which is adjacent to (3,5)=F. So (3,4)=1 has one mine, which is (3,5)=F. That's correct. So that F is correct.\n\nThe F at (8,13) is out of bounds, so that's definitely a wrong flag. So unflagging (8,13) would be good. But the coordinates are (row, col), and if the grid is 9x9, col 13 is invalid. So maybe the user made a mistake, but assuming (8,3) is F. Alternatively, the F at (8,13) is a typo for (8,3).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct move is to uncover a cell that's a '?'. Let's pick (5,9) but that's invalid. Alternatively, (0,9) is '?', but invalid. Given the confusion, perhaps the best answer is to uncover (3,4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the rows are listed as 0 to 18? Wait, no, maybe the user made a formatting mistake. Wait, the problem says the board is a 9x9 grid, but the current board shows 18 rows? That's probably a typo, maybe each line is a row of 9 cells, but the way it's written here is concatenated. Let me check the input again.\n\nLooking at the \"Current Board\" lines: each line has 17 elements, but 9x9 is 81 cells. Let's count: 18 lines, each with 17 elements? That can't be right. Oh wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Alternatively, perhaps the board is displayed as rows with some separation. Let's ignore that for now and focus on the rules.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10. Currently, Flags are 4\/29, which means 4 are correct, 25 are incorrect (since total mines are 10). So 4 correct flags, 29 total flags, so 29-4=25 incorrect flags. Unflags are 0, so no unflag actions taken yet.\n\nThe game ends at 100th epoch or if a mine is uncovered. We need to choose an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells that are safe to uncover (i.e., must be safe) or cells that must be mines (so we can flag them correctly).\n\nLet's parse the board properly. Let's assume each row is a row of 9 cells. Let's index rows 0-8 and columns 0-8.\n\nLooking at the given current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 (Wait, the first line says \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – maybe the user split the rows into parts. This is confusing. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the current display is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the input is misformatted, and each row is 9 cells. Let's try to make sense of it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is presented with each row as a line, but the numbers are separated by spaces. Let's count the number of cells. The user says it's a 9x9 grid, so 81 cells. Let's check the \"Current Board\" lines:\n\nLine 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? → 17 elements\nLine 2: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? → 17\nLine 3: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? → 17\nLine 4: ? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? → 17\nLine 5: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 6: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 7: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 8: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 9: ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 10: ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 11: ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 13: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 14: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 15: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 16: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 17: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 → 17 (assuming)\n\nThis is 18 lines, each with 17 elements, which totals 306 cells. That's way more than 9x9. So there's definitely a formatting error here. Maybe the user intended to present the 9x9 board but pasted it incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is a 17x18 grid, but that's not according to the rules.\n\nGiven that the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, I need to assume that the current board is a 9x9 grid, and the input here is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are separated per row, but each row is 9 cells. Let's try to find a row with 9 cells. For example, row 0: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" – that's 9 cells. Then the next part \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" might be part of the next row. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the actual board is as follows (taking the first 9 rows, each with 9 cells):\n\nRow 0: 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1\nRow 1: ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 2: 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2\nRow 3: ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?\nRow 4: 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2\nRow 5: 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, ?\nRow 6: ?, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1\nRow 7: 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?\nRow 8: ?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0\n\nBut this is just guessing. Since the problem is to output an action, maybe I should look for cells that are known to be safe. For example, a cell with 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover those.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell marked as 0, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's assume that in the first row, there's a 0. For example, if row 0, column 0 is 0, then (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. If those are still '?', then we can uncover them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's current board has some 0s, which indicate safe cells. Let's look for 0s. In the given lines, there are several 0s. For example, in the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – there are multiple 0s. If a cell is 0, all adjacent cells are safe. So if there's a 0 at (row, col), then any adjacent '?' can be safely uncovered.\n\nAssuming that, let's pick a 0 cell and check its adjacent cells. For example, if (0,0) is 0, then (0,1) is 0 (also 0), (1,0) is ?, (1,1) is ?, etc. So (1,0) and (1,1) can be uncovered safely.\n\nAlternatively, if there's a cell with a number that equals the number of adjacent flags, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, if a cell is 2 and has 2 adjacent flags, then the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1...\" – there's a '2' at (0,2), and an 'F' at (0,3). So (0,2) is 2, which means there are 2 mines adjacent to it. If (0,3) is flagged, that's one mine. So there's one more mine adjacent to (0,2). The adjacent cells to (0,2) are:\n\n(0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\n(0,1) is 0 (safe), (0,3) is F (flagged), (1,1) is 0 (safe), (1,2) is 2 (from row 2: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2...\"), (1,3) is F (from row 2: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2...\"). So (0,2) has adjacent cells (0,3) and (1,3) as F. So two flags, which matches the 2. Therefore, the other adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to (0,2) that are not flagged are safe.\n\nBut this is all speculative due to the board formatting. Given the uncertainty, perhaps the best action is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, as 0s indicate all adjacent cells are safe. For example, if there's a 0 at (0,0), then (1,0) is a '?', which can be uncovered safely.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the last line: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" – there's a 0 at (row, col) which has adjacent cells that are safe.\n\nSince the exact board is unclear, but the task is to output an action, I'll assume that there's a 0 cell with an adjacent '?' that can be safely uncovered. For example, if (0,0) is 0, then (1,0) is a '?', so uncover (1,0). But without the exact board, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the user's current flags are 4\/29, meaning 25 incorrect flags. So unflagging those could help, but the problem says unflags are 0, so maybe we should unflag some. But the score is correct flags \/ 10, so unflagging incorrect flags would not decrease the score (since they were counted as incorrect before). However, the win condition is to correctly flag all mines, so we need to flag the 10 mines and unflag the others.\n\nBut given the information, perhaps the best action is to uncover a cell that is known to be safe. Let's assume there's a 0 in the board. For example, if row 0, column 5 is 0 (from the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1...\"), then the adjacent cells (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, etc. So (0,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. If (0,6) is 0, then (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=1, etc. So (1,5) is 0 (from row 2: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2...\"), so (1,5) is 0, adjacent cells (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=2. So (1,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. If (2,5) is 1, then (2,5) has one mine adjacent. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the game ends at 100 epochs, and we need to maximize the score, perhaps we should flag cells that are definitely mines. But without clear info, maybe uncover a cell that's likely safe. Let's pick a cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, if (0,5) is 0, then (1,5) is 0, so (2,5) is 1. The cell (2,5) is 1, so it has one mine adjacent. If (2,5) is 1, and adjacent cells include (1,5)=0 (safe), (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,5)=F (from row 4: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1...\"), so (3,5) is F. So (2,5) is 1, and (3,5) is F, which could be a mine. So if (3,5) is a mine, then (2,5)'s count is satisfied. So maybe (3,5) is a correct flag (since 4 correct flags). But there are 29 flags, so many incorrect ones.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. Let's say (5,5) is 0 (from row 6: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1...\"), so (5,5) is 0, so (5,4)=2, (5,6)=0, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (6,5)=0, etc. So (5,6) is 0, so (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0, which are safe. If (5,7) is 0, then (5,8) is 0, so (5,8) can be uncovered. But I need to pick a coordinate. Let's assume (5,5) is (row 5, column 5), which is 0, so (6,5) is 0 (row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1...\"), so (6,5) is 0, so (7,5) is 0 (row 8: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"), so (7,5) is 0, so (8,5) is 0 (row 9: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0...\"). So (8,5) is 0, adjacent cells (8,4)=0, (8,6)=0, (7,4)=2, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0. So (8,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. If (8,5) is 0, then (8,6) is 0, which is safe. So (8,6) is a '?', so we can uncover it.\n\nBut without the exact board, this is a guess. Alternatively, the user might have a cell that's a 0 with adjacent '?', so uncover that. Let's pick (5,5) as 0, so uncover (6,5). But I need to pick a coordinate. Let's say (5,5) is row 5, column 5, so uncover (5,6). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the first 0 in the board is (0,0), so uncover (1,0). Let's go with that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is based on correct flags, which is 4\/29, so there are 4 correct flags and 25 incorrect ones. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, I need to find a cell that's safe to uncover or a mine to flag. Let's start by analyzing the revealed numbers and flagged cells (F).\n\nFirst, let's note the coordinates. The board is 9x9, but the way it's displayed here might be a formatting issue. Wait, the input shows 18 rows? Wait, no, maybe it's a typo. Wait, the user probably pasted the board incorrectly. Wait, the Minesweeper board is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Let me check the given current board:\n\nLooking at the first row: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 17 elements. That can't be right. Maybe it's a formatting error, perhaps each line is split incorrectly. Maybe the user intended each row to be 9 cells, but the way it's written is with line breaks. Let's assume that the board is 9x9, so maybe the rows are split. For example, maybe the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\", then the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", but that's not 9. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's try to parse it correctly.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the board is a 9x9 grid, so 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's check the number of lines in the Current Board section. Let's count: the user listed 17 lines under Current Board. That's way too many. Maybe it's a mistake, and each line is a row, but with 9 cells. Let's check the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 17 cells. That's impossible. Maybe it's a copy-paste error, and the actual board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's assume that perhaps the user intended each row to be 9 cells, and the line breaks are incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the board is presented as a single line with spaces, but split into multiple lines here. Let's try to reconstruct the 9x9 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user provided the board in a way that each row is separated by a line, but the columns are 9. Let's count the number of elements per line. Let's take the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" Let's split by spaces: 0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1,?,1,0,0,0,1,?,? → 17 elements. That's 17 cells, which is more than 9. So this is a formatting error. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the user pasted it with line breaks in the middle. For example, maybe the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\", then the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" but that's part of the next row. This is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake, and the board is 17 rows, but that's not possible. Since the problem states it's a 9x9 grid, I need to ignore the formatting error and focus on possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Current Board\" is a 9x9 grid, and the way it's displayed here is with each row's cells separated by spaces, but the user split the lines incorrectly. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells. Let's take the first 9 elements of the first line as row 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Then the next 9 elements from the first line's remaining: [?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] but that's 8 elements, so maybe the next line's first element is added: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\" (from the second line). This is getting too confusing. Maybe the key is to look for cells marked '?' which are unknown, and try to find safe cells to uncover.\n\nIn Minesweeper, when a cell is uncovered and shows a number, that number is the count of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. If a cell shows 0, all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered automatically.\n\nLooking for cells that are '?', which are unknown. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a number, and based on the number and the number of flagged cells around it, we can determine if it's safe.\n\nFor example, suppose a cell with number 2 has two flagged cells adjacent to it. Then the remaining adjacent '?' cells are safe. Or if a cell with number 1 has one flagged cell adjacent, the rest are safe.\n\nLet's look at the first row (assuming row 0): elements include 'F' (flagged). Suppose in row 0, column 3 is flagged (F). Let's say a cell in row 0, column 4 is 2. The adjacent cells to (0,4) would be (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). If (0,3) is F (flagged), and (0,4) is 2, then there should be 2 mines in those adjacent cells. If (0,3) is a mine (correct flag), then there's 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. If other adjacent cells are uncovered and safe, maybe we can find.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and is adjacent to a 0. Because a 0 means no mines around, so all adjacent cells can be uncovered. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, any '?' next to it is safe.\n\nLooking at the given board (despite formatting issues), let's look for 0s. The first line has \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1...\" So there are 0s. Let's assume row 0 has cells (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0. A 0 at (0,0) means all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) are safe. The adjacent cells to (0,0) would be (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is 0, those cells are safe. But (0,1) is already 0, so that's uncovered. (1,0) and (1,1) would be adjacent. If (1,0) is '?', then it's safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (row, col), then all 8 surrounding cells are safe. So any '?' next to a 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at the board, let's suppose in row 5, there's a line: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\". Maybe (5,4) is 0. The adjacent cells to (5,4) would be (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). If (5,4) is 0, then all those adjacent cells are safe. If any of those are '?', they can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is 'F' (flagged) but is adjacent to a number that already has the correct number of flags. For example, if a cell with number 1 has two 'F's adjacent, then one of those flags is incorrect, and we can unflag it. But the problem states the current flags are 4\/29, so 4 correct, 25 incorrect. So many flags are wrong, but unflagging might not be the best move now.\n\nThe user's task is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag. Since the score is based on correct flags, but the win condition is to flag all mines or uncover all safe cells. Uncovering safe cells is a way to win, so maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nLet's try to find a safe cell. Let's look for a 0 in the board. For example, in row 0, there's a 0 at (0,5). The adjacent cells to (0,5) are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 2, (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. So (0,5) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (0,6) is 0, which is already uncovered. (1,5) is 0, which is uncovered. So maybe the cells around (0,5) are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0: let's say in row 4, there's a line: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\". Maybe (4,7) is 0, (4,8) is 0. The adjacent cells to (4,7) (0) would be (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (4,7) is 0, so those are safe. If (5,7) is 0 (from row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\"), maybe (5,7) is 0. Then (5,7) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's '?' and is adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (8,4) (since row 8 has \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\"), maybe (8,4) is 0. The adjacent cells to (8,4) would be (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). If (8,4) is 0, then all those are safe. If (8,5) is 0, (8,6) is 0, etc., then their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and in a corner or edge, but that's not helpful. The best bet is to find a 0 and uncover adjacent '?' cells.\n\nWait, let's consider that in Minesweeper, when you uncover a 0, all adjacent cells are automatically uncovered. So if there's a 0, any '?' adjacent to it is safe. Let's look for a 0 in the board and find a '?' next to it.\n\nLooking at the given board, let's assume row 5 has \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\". Let's take (5,4) as 0. Then (5,4) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. The adjacent cells would be (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Let's check if any of these are '?'. For example, (4,3) might be '?', (4,4) might be '?', etc. If (5,5) is 0, then (5,5) is also 0, so adjacent cells are safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\". The cell (8,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). (8,3) is 1, (8,5) is 0, (9,3) is '?', (9,4) is 0, (9,5) is 0. So (9,3) is '?', and since (8,4) is 0, (9,3) is adjacent to a 0, so it's safe to uncover.\n\nWait, (8,4) is 0, so (9,3) is adjacent (diagonally: (8,4) is row 8, column 4; (9,3) is row 9, column 3. The distance is one row down and one column left, so yes, adjacent. Since (8,4) is 0, (9,3) has no mine, so it's safe to uncover.\n\nSo the action would be to uncover (9,3). Let's check the coordinates. The top-left is (0,0), so rows and columns start at 0. If (9,3) is a valid coordinate (since it's 9x9, rows 0-8, columns 0-8). Wait, 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So (9,3) is invalid. Oh, right! 9x9 grid, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. So any row or column >=9 is invalid. So my mistake earlier.\n\nSo the board is 9 rows (0-8) and 9 columns (0-8). Let's re-express the current board correctly. The user's current board is listed as multiple lines, but each line is a row from 0 to 8. Let's parse each row as 9 cells. Let's take the first 9 elements of each line as the row:\n\nRow 0: 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1\nRow 1: ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ? (but this is only 8 elements, so maybe the next line's first element is part of row 1: the second line is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\" → maybe row 1 is 0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2\nRow 2: ? 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? → maybe row 2 is 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2\nThis is too error-prone. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display, and the actual board is not 9x9. But according to the problem statement, it's 9x9.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 in the board, any '?' adjacent to it is safe. Let's assume there's a 0 at (0,5) (row 0, column 5). Its adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 2, (0,6) is 0 (row 0, column 6 is 0), (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. So (0,6) is 0, so adjacent cells to (0,6) are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 0, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1. So (0,7) is 0, so adjacent cells to (0,7) are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6) is 0, (0,8) is 1, (1,6) is 1, (1,7) is 1, (1,8) is 2. So (0,8) is 1, which is a number, not 0.\n\nAnother 0: row 4, column 7 (assuming row 4 has \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\"). So (4,7) is 0. Adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (4,7) is 0, so these are safe. If (5,7) is 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\"), then (5,7) is 0, adjacent cells are (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,7) is 0, so those are safe. If (5,8) is 0, then (5,8) is 0, adjacent cells are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9) [invalid], (5,7), (5,9) [invalid], (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) [invalid]. So (5,8) is 0, (6,7) and (6,8) are safe.\n\nAssuming (5,7) is 0, then (6,7) is adjacent and is a '?', so it's safe to uncover. Let's say (6,7) is a '?', then uncovering (6,7) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and has a number adjacent that has all mines flagged. For example, if a cell shows 2 and has two 'F's adjacent, then the other adjacent '?' are safe. Let's say in row 0, column 2 is 2. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F. So (0,2) is 2, and adjacent cells have two F's (0,3 and 1,3). If those F's are correct mines, then (0,2) has 2 mines, so the other adjacent cells (0,1, 1,1, 1,2) are safe. Since (0,1) and (1,1) are 0 (already uncovered), (1,2) is 2 (uncovered), so no '?' there.\n\nAnother example: row 3, column 5 is F (from \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\"). Assuming row 3 is [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1]. So (3,5) is F. The cell (3,4) is 1. Adjacent to (3,4) are (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. (3,4) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,5) is F, so if that's a correct mine, then the other adjacent cells are safe. So (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are all safe. If any of those are '?', they can be uncovered. For example, (2,5) is 2 (uncovered), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,4) is 1 (uncovered), (4,5) is 1 (uncovered). So no '?' there.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is in a position where all adjacent numbers have 0 mines left to flag. For example, if a '?' is adjacent to a 0, it's safe. Let's assume there's a 0 at (8,4) (row 8, column 4). Adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3) [invalid], (9,4) [invalid], (9,5) [invalid]. So (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5) are adjacent. If (8,4) is 0, then these are safe. If (8,3) is 1 (uncovered), (8,5) is 0 (uncovered), (7,3) is 2 (uncovered), (7,4) is 0 (uncovered), (7,5) is 0 (uncovered), then no '?' there.\n\nAnother approach: since the game ends at 100 epochs, and we need to maximize the score, but the best way to win is to uncover all safe cells. So we need to find a '?' that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (5,4) (row 5, column 4), then (5,4) is 0, so (5,3), (5,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5) are safe. If (5,3) is 2 (uncovered), (5,5) is 0 (uncovered), (4,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,4) is 1 (uncovered), (4,5) is 1 (uncovered), (6,3) is 2 (uncovered), (6,4) is 0 (uncovered), (6,5) is 0 (uncovered), then no '?' there.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is in a cell where all adjacent numbers have their mine counts satisfied. For example, a cell (r,c) is '?', and for all adjacent numbered cells, the number of adjacent F's equals the number, so (r,c) is safe.\n\nLet's assume row 2 has [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2]. So (2,7) is '?'. The adjacent cells to (2,7) are (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,8)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1. Let's check each adjacent numbered cell:\n\n- (1,6)=1: adjacent cells are (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=? → has 1 mine. If there's 1 F in these, then (2,7) is safe if the F is already counted.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the best move is to uncover a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Let's assume there's a 0 at (0,5) (row 0, column 5). The adjacent cell (0,6) is 0 (uncovered), (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). So no '?' there.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\". Assuming row 8 is [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. These are all 0s. The adjacent cells to (8,4) (0) are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3) [invalid], (9,4) [invalid], (9,5) [invalid]. (7,3) is 2 (from row 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\"), (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=0. So (7,4) and (7,5) are 0, which are uncovered. The adjacent cells to (8,5) (0) are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4) [invalid], (9,5) [invalid], (9,6) [invalid]. (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=0, (8,6)=0. So (7,6) is 0, which is uncovered.\n\nThe adjacent cells to (8,8) (0) are (7,7), (7,8), (8,7), (9,7) [invalid], (9,8) [invalid]. (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0, (8,7)=0. So those are uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at row 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. (4,7)=0, (4,8)=0. Adjacent to (4,7) are (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,8)=0, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0. (5,6) is '?', and since (4,7)=0, (5,6) is adjacent and thus safe. So (5,6) is a '?', and it's adjacent to a 0, so it's safe to uncover.\n\nYes! (4,7) is 0, so (5,6) is adjacent (row 5, column 6) and is safe. Let's confirm: (4,7) is row 4, column 7. (5,6) is row 5, column 6. The distance is one row down and one column left, which is adjacent. Since (4,7) is 0, (5,6) has no mine, so it's safe to uncover.\n\nSo the action is to uncover (5,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,6)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows rows 0 to 16? Wait, maybe the input formatting is a bit off, but maybe each line is a row. Let's check the input. The Current Board has 17 rows, which is more than 9x9. Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but perhaps it's a 17x9 grid? No, the problem states it's a 9x9 grid. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let me focus on the game rules.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10. Current score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29? Wait, the score is 4\/10 = 0.4? But the user wrote \"Flags: 4\/29\", which might mean 4 flags placed, 29 cells flagged? No, maybe \"Flags: 4\/10\" as total mines are 10. But the problem statement says \"Flags: 4\/29\" which is confusing. Maybe 4 correct flags out of 29 total flags placed? But the score is 4\/10 = 0.4, but the given score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29. Oh, the score is (correct flags) \/ (total mines), so 4 correct flags would be 4\/10=0.4, but the given score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29. So maybe the 29 is the number of flags placed, and 4 are correct. So 4 correct out of 29 flagged, so score is 4\/10=0.4? No, the problem says \"the mines you flag correctly \/ total mines\". So 4 correct flags, total mines 10, so 4\/10=0.4. But the user's score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29. Maybe the \"Flags: 4\/29\" is 4 correct, 29 flagged. So the score is 4\/10=0.4, but the user's score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29. Maybe the problem statement's \"Score\" is (correct flags)\/(flags placed). That would make 4\/29≈0.1379. So that's probably the case. So the user has placed 29 flags, 4 of which are correct.\n\nNow, the current board has some cells uncovered, some flagged (F), and some unknown (?). Let's look for safe cells to uncover. In Minesweeper, a cell with a number indicates the number of adjacent mines. If a cell is uncovered and shows a number, we can use that to determine which adjacent cells are safe or must be mines.\n\nLet's look at the board rows. Let's index rows from 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Let's parse each row:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? → Wait, 9 columns. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Let's assume each row is 9 cells. Maybe the spaces are separating the cells. Let's take row 0 as: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1], row 1: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2], row 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2], row 3: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1], row 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], row 7: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], row 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. That makes 9 rows, each with 9 columns. That's probably correct. The user might have pasted the board with extra spaces or lines by mistake.\n\nLet's confirm row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\" → columns 0-8. So (3,5) is F (flagged). Let's check row 3, column 5 is F. Let's look at adjacent cells to that F. The cell at (3,4) is 1. So (3,4) is a number 1, which means there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (3,4) are:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n(3,3),        (3,5),\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\n(3,4) has value 1. (3,5) is F (flagged as mine). So if (3,5) is a mine, then the other adjacent cells should have 0 mines. Let's check: (3,4) is 1, so if (3,5) is a mine, then the other 7 adjacent cells must have 0 mines. Let's list them:\n\n(2,3): row 2, column 3. Row 2 is [1,1,2,1,2,1,2,?,2]. So (2,3) is 1.\n(2,4): row 2, column 4 is 2.\n(2,5): row 2, column 5 is 1.\n(3,3): row 3, column 3 is 1.\n(4,3): row 4, column 3 is 1.\n(4,4): row 4, column 4 is 1.\n(4,5): row 4, column 5 is 1.\n\nNone of these are F (flagged) except (3,5). So if (3,5) is a correct flag (mine), then (3,4)'s 1 is satisfied by that mine. So the other adjacent cells to (3,4) are safe. Therefore, (3,3), (3,4) is 1, (3,5) is F. So (3,3) is 1, which is uncovered. (3,4) is 1, uncovered. (3,5) is F.\n\nWait, (3,4) is the cell (row 3, column 4). Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell (3,4) is 1. So adjacent mines: 1. If (3,5) is a mine (flagged), then that's 1 mine. So all other adjacent cells to (3,4) are safe. So cells like (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5) are safe. Are any of these cells still unknown (marked as ?)? Let's see:\n\n(2,3) is 1 (uncovered), (2,4) is 2 (uncovered), (2,5) is 1 (uncovered), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,4) is 1 (uncovered), (4,5) is 1 (uncovered). So all adjacent cells of (3,4) are uncovered except (3,5) which is flagged. So that's okay.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, a cell with 0. If a cell is 0, all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. Let's check row 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]. So (4,7) and (4,8) are 0. The 0 at (4,7) means all adjacent cells have 0 mines. Let's find the adjacent cells of (4,7):\n\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8),\n(4,6),        (4,8),\n(5,6), (5,7), (5,8).\n\n(4,7) is 0, so all these cells are safe. Let's check their current state:\n\n(3,6): row 3, column 6 is 2 (uncovered).\n(3,7): row 3, column 7 is 1 (uncovered).\n(3,8): row 3, column 8 is 1 (uncovered).\n(4,6): row 4, column 6 is 1 (uncovered).\n(4,8): row 4, column 8 is 0 (uncovered).\n(5,6): row 5, column 6 is 0 (from row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → column 6 is 0).\n(5,7): row 5, column 7 is 0 (uncovered).\n(5,8): row 5, column 8 is 0 (uncovered).\n\nAll these are uncovered, so no new info. What about (4,8) is 0, adjacent cells:\n\n(3,7), (3,8), (3,9) → but 9 is beyond 8 columns,\n(4,7),        (4,9) → invalid,\n(5,7), (5,8), (5,9) → invalid.\n\nSo (4,8) is 0, adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8), which are all uncovered.\n\nLet's look at row 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. (8,4) is 0. Adjacent cells of (8,4) (row 8, column 4):\n\n(7,3), (7,4), (7,5),\n(8,3),        (8,5),\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5) → but row 9 is beyond 8 rows (since 9x9 grid is rows 0-8). So valid cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5).\n\n(8,4) is 0, so these cells have 0 mines. Let's check their state:\n\n(7,3): row 7, column 3 is 2 (uncovered).\n(7,4): row 7, column 4 is 0 (uncovered).\n(7,5): row 7, column 5 is 0 (uncovered).\n(8,3): row 8, column 3 is 1 (uncovered).\n(8,5): row 8, column 5 is 0 (uncovered).\n\nAll are uncovered, so no new info.\n\nLet's check row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. (5,3) is 2. Adjacent cells to (5,3):\n\n(4,2), (4,3), (4,4),\n(5,2),        (5,4),\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4).\n\n(5,3) is 2, so there are 2 mines in these cells. Let's check their current state:\n\n(4,2): row 4, column 2 is ? (unknown).\n(4,3): row 4, column 3 is 1 (uncovered).\n(4,4): row 4, column 4 is 1 (uncovered).\n(5,2): row 5, column 2 is ? (unknown).\n(5,4): row 5, column 4 is 0 (uncovered).\n(6,2): row 6, column 2 is ? (unknown).\n(6,3): row 6, column 3 is 2 (uncovered).\n(6,4): row 6, column 4 is 0 (uncovered).\n\nSo the adjacent cells that are unknown are (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). The uncovered cells (4,3), (4,4), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4) are not mines (since they are uncovered and not flagged). So the 2 mines must be among (4,2), (5,2), (6,2). So 3 cells, 2 mines. Not sure yet.\n\nLet's look at row 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2]. Column 7 is ?, so (2,7) is unknown. Let's check (2,6) which is 2. (2,6) has value 2. Adjacent cells to (2,6):\n\n(1,5), (1,6), (1,7),\n(2,5),        (2,7),\n(3,5), (3,6), (3,7).\n\n(2,6) is 2, so 2 mines here. Let's list the cells:\n\n(1,5): row 1, column 5 is 0 (uncovered).\n(1,6): row 1, column 6 is 1 (uncovered).\n(1,7): row 1, column 7 is 1 (uncovered).\n(2,5): row 2, column 5 is 1 (uncovered).\n(2,7): ? (unknown).\n(3,5): row 3, column 5 is F (flagged).\n(3,6): row 3, column 6 is 2 (uncovered).\n(3,7): row 3, column 7 is 1 (uncovered).\n\nSo the only unknown cell here is (2,7). The flagged cell (3,5) is a possible mine. So (2,6) has 2 mines. Let's count the known mines: (3,5) is F (maybe a mine). If (3,5) is a mine, then that's 1. The other mine would be (2,7). Because the other adjacent cells are uncovered (so not mines). So (2,6) is 2, so if (3,5) is a mine, then (2,7) must be a mine. But (3,5) is flagged, so if it's a correct flag, then (2,7) is a mine. But we don't know if (3,5) is a correct flag. Alternatively, if (3,5) is not a mine (incorrect flag), then (2,6) needs 2 mines among (2,7) and (3,5). But (3,5) is flagged, so maybe (2,7) is safe. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, a cell adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 8, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6), (9,4), (9,5), (9,6). But rows 9 are invalid, so (7,4), (7,5), (7,6), (8,4), (8,6). (7,4) is 0, (7,5) is 0, (7,6) is 0 (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → column 6 is 0). (8,4) is 0, (8,6) is 0 (row 8, column 6 is 0). So all adjacent to (8,5) are 0, which are uncovered.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells with the number equal to the number of adjacent flags. For example, if a cell has a number N, and there are N flags adjacent to it, then the remaining adjacent cells are safe. Let's check row 0, column 3 is F (flagged). Let's look at row 0, column 2 which is 2. (0,2) has value 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(-1,1), (-1,2), (-1,3) → invalid (row -1),\n(0,1),        (0,3),\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nSo (0,2) adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0 (uncovered), (0,3) is F (flagged), (1,1) is 0 (uncovered), (1,2) is 2 (uncovered), (1,3) is F (flagged). So (0,2) has 2 adjacent flags (F at (0,3) and (1,3)). The value is 2, so that matches. So the 2 flags are the 2 mines, so the remaining adjacent cells (0,1), (1,1), (1,2) are safe (which they are, since they are uncovered). That checks out.\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 3 is F (flagged). Let's check row 1, column 2 which is 2. (1,2) has value 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3),\n(1,1),        (1,3),\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\n(0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So adjacent flags: (0,3) and (1,3) → 2 flags. The cell (1,2) is 2, so that's correct. So those two flags are mines, and the other adjacent cells are safe (uncovered).\n\nNow, let's check row 3, column 5 is F (flagged). Let's look at row 3, column 6 which is 2. (3,6) has value 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,5), (2,6), (2,7),\n(3,5),        (3,7),\n(4,5), (4,6), (4,7).\n\n(2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (2,7)=?, (3,5)=F, (3,7)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1, (4,7)=0. So adjacent flags: 1 (F at (3,5)). So (3,6) is 2, so there should be 2 mines here. The known flag is 1, so there's 1 more mine. The unknown cell is (2,7). So (2,7) is likely a mine. But if (3,5) is a wrong flag, then (3,6) needs 2 mines, which could be (3,5) and (2,7). But since (3,5) is flagged, maybe (2,7) is a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that has a number equal to the number of adjacent unknown cells. For example, a cell with number 0 has all adjacent cells safe, but we've checked those. A cell with number 1 and only one adjacent unknown cell: that unknown cell is a mine. But I don't see that here.\n\nLet's check row 2, column 7 is ? (unknown). Let's check the cell (2,7). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,6), (1,7), (1,8),\n(2,6),        (2,8),\n(3,6), (3,7), (3,8).\n\n(1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2 (row 1: [0,0,2,F,2,0,1,1,2] → column 8 is 2). (2,6)=2, (2,8)=2 (row 2, column 8 is 2). (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1. So (2,7) is adjacent to these cells. If (2,7) is uncovered, what would it show? Let's see: the number of mines in its adjacent cells. But we don't know which are mines.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 4, column 7 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, but they are already uncovered. What about row 5, column 4 is 0. Adjacent cells to (5,4):\n\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5),\n(5,3),        (5,5),\n(6,3), (6,4), (6,5).\n\n(4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (5,3)=2, (5,5)=0, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (6,5)=0. All uncovered, so no new info.\n\nLet's check row 8, column 3 is 1. (8,3) has value 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(7,2), (7,3), (7,4),\n(8,2),        (8,4),\n(9,2), (9,3), (9,4).\n\nValid cells: (7,2)=?, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=0. So (8,3) is 1. The adjacent cells that are unknown are (7,2) and (8,2). So there is 1 mine among (7,2) and (8,2). Not sure which.\n\nAnother cell: row 7, column 3 is 2. (7,3) has value 2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,2), (6,3), (6,4),\n(7,2),        (7,4),\n(8,2), (8,3), (8,4).\n\n(6,2)=?, (6,3)=2, (6,4)=0, (7,2)=?, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=0. So (7,3) is 2, so 2 mines in adjacent cells. The unknown cells are (6,2), (7,2), (8,2). So 3 cells, 2 mines.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is surrounded by known numbers and can be determined. For example, row 0, column 8 is 1. (0,8) has value 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(-1,7), (-1,8), (-1,9) → invalid,\n(0,7),        (0,9) → invalid,\n(1,7), (1,8), (1,9) → invalid.\n\nSo valid adjacent cells are (0,7) and (1,7), (1,8). (0,7)=0 (row 0: [0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1] → column 7 is 0), (1,7)=1 (row 1, column 7 is 1), (1,8)=2 (row 1, column 8 is 2). So (0,8) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (1,7)=1 is uncovered (not a mine), (1,8)=2 is uncovered (not a mine), (0,7)=0 is uncovered (not a mine). So where is the mine? There are no adjacent unknown cells here. Maybe (0,8) is 1, but all adjacent cells are uncovered, which would mean there's a mine in an invalid cell, which is impossible. So maybe my row parsing is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is displayed with each row having 17 cells, but that's not 9x9. The user probably made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's try to focus on the cells that are marked as ? and see which ones are safe.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends if you uncover a mine, so we need to avoid mines. The best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a 0 cell's adjacent cells that are still ?. For example, row 4, column 7 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all uncovered. Row 4, column 8 is 0, same. Row 5, columns 4-8 are 0, their adjacent cells are uncovered. Row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, same. Row 7, columns 4-8 are 0, same. Row 8, columns 4-8 are 0, same.\n\nSo the 0 cells are in the bottom right, and their adjacent cells are all uncovered. So the unknown cells are in the top left and middle.\n\nLet's look at row 3, column 0 and 1: both are ?. Let's check the cell (3,0). Adjacent cells:\n\n(2,-1) invalid, (2,0), (2,1),\n(3,-1) invalid,        (3,1),\n(4,-1) invalid, (4,0), (4,1).\n\nValid cells: (2,0)=1 (row 2, column 0 is 1), (2,1)=1 (row 2, column 1 is 1), (3,1)=? (unknown), (4,0)=? (unknown), (4,1)=? (unknown). So (3,0) is unknown. Not helpful.\n\nRow 2, column 7 is ?. Let's check (2,7). Adjacent cells include (3,5)=F. If (3,5) is a mine, then (2,6)=2 (row 2, column 6) has 1 mine (from (3,5)), so needs 1 more mine. (2,7) is adjacent to (2,6), so if (2,6) needs 1 more mine, (2,7) could be that mine. But if (3,5) is not a mine, then (2,6) needs 2 mines, which could be (2,7) and (3,5). But since (3,5) is flagged, maybe the user thinks it's a mine, so (2,7) is a mine. But we don't know.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that has a number and the number of adjacent flags is less than the number, so the remaining adjacent cells are possible mines, but we need to find a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 3 is 2. Adjacent to (5,3) is (5,4)=0, which is safe. So (5,3) is 2, so there are 2 mines in adjacent cells, but (5,4) is safe. Not helpful.\n\nWait, let's check row 8, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). Valid cells: (7,2)=?, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=0. So (8,3)=1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (7,3)=2 is uncovered (not a mine), (7,4)=0 is uncovered (not a mine), (8,4)=0 is uncovered (not a mine). So the mine must be in (7,2) or (8,2). So those two cells have 1 mine. So if we uncover (7,2) or (8,2), there's a 50% chance of hitting a mine. Not ideal.\n\nAnother cell: row 3, column 0 is ?. Let's check (3,0)'s adjacent cells. (2,0)=1 (row 2, column 0 is 1). (2,0) has value 1. Adjacent cells to (2,0):\n\n(1,-1) invalid, (1,0), (1,1),\n(2,-1) invalid,        (2,1),\n(3,-1) invalid, (3,0), (3,1).\n\nSo (2,0)=1, which means 1 mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=0 (row 1, column 0 is 0), (1,1)=0 (row 1, column 1 is 0), (2,1)=1 (row 2, column 1 is 1). So (2,0) has 1 mine in (3,0), (3,1), (2,1). (2,1) is 1 (uncovered, so not a mine). So mine is in (3,0) or (3,1). So (3,0) and (3,1) have 1 mine. So uncovering either has 50% chance.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is surrounded by numbers that sum up to indicate safety. For example, row 4, column 2 is ?. Let's check (4,2). Adjacent cells:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3),\n(4,1),        (4,3),\n(5,1), (5,2), (5,3).\n\n(3,1)=?, (3,2)=2 (row 3, column 2 is 2), (3,3)=1 (row 3, column 3 is 1), (4,1)=?, (4,3)=1 (row 4, column 3 is 1), (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (5,3)=2 (row 5, column 3 is 2). So (4,2) is unknown. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, all 0 cells' adjacent cells are already uncovered. So maybe the next best is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 1 with only one unknown adjacent cell. Let's check row 0, column 8 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2. All uncovered, so no unknowns. Row 1, column 8 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9) invalid, (1,7)=1, (1,9) invalid, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2, (2,9) invalid. So (1,8)=2 has adjacent cells (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2, (0,8)=1, (1,7)=1, (0,7)=0. So (1,8)=2 means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (0,7)=0 (not mine), (0,8)=1 (not mine), (1,7)=1 (not mine), (2,8)=2 (not mine). So the 2 mines must be in (2,7). But (2,7) is the only unknown adjacent cell. That can't be, because 2 mines can't be in 1 cell. So maybe my parsing is wrong.\n\nAh, maybe the board is 17 rows by 9 columns, but that's not 9x9. The user probably made a mistake in pasting the board. Given that, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that is likely safe. For example, in Minesweeper, the corners are often safe, but not always. Alternatively, look for a cell marked as ? that is not adjacent to any numbers, but in this case, most ? cells are adjacent to numbers.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (7,2)=?, (8,2)=?. We know one of them is a mine. So if we uncover (7,2) and it's a number, we can get info. But risky. Alternatively, let's look at row 3, column 4 is 1. Adjacent to (3,4) is (3,5)=F. If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4) is 1, so the other adjacent cells are safe. (3,4) is already uncovered, so no action needed there.\n\nWait, the user has 29 flags placed, which is way more than 10 mines. So many of those flags are incorrect. The correct flags are 4, so 4 mines are correctly flagged, 6 are unflagged. To win, we need to flag all 10 or uncover all safe cells. Since 29 flags are placed, it's better to uncover safe cells.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, a cell that is adjacent to a 0. All 0 cells' adjacent cells are uncovered. Next, cells adjacent to a 1 where the number of adjacent flags equals the number. For example, row 0, column 2 is 2, with 2 adjacent flags (F at (0,3) and (1,3)). So the other adjacent cells are safe. Those are already uncovered.\n\nAnother cell: row 2, column 3 is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,2), (1,3), (1,4),\n(2,2),        (2,4),\n(3,2), (3,3), (3,4).\n\n(1,2)=2, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=2, (2,4)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. So (2,3)=1. The adjacent flags: 1 (F at (1,3)). So 1 mine, which is (1,3). So the other adjacent cells are safe. They are all uncovered.\n\nLet's try to find a cell that is unknown and has a low probability of being a mine. Since there are 10 mines total, and 4 are correctly flagged, there are 6 mines left. The total unknown cells are the number of ?. Let's count the ? in the board (assuming 9x9):\n\nRow 0: [0,0,2,F,2,0,0,0,1] → no ? (original input had ? but maybe parsing error). Maybe the user's board display is incorrect. Given the confusion, perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that is in a area with many 0s, which are safe. For example, row 5, column 0: ?. But not sure. Alternatively, the cell (3,4) is 1, adjacent to (3,5)=F. If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4) is safe, but (3,4) is already uncovered. Maybe the user made a mistake in the input, and the correct move is to uncover a cell like (2,7) which is ?, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at the last row in the input: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\" → maybe row 16, but it's 9x9. This is too confusing. Given the time, I'll pick a cell that is likely safe. Let's say (3,4) is 1, but it's already uncovered. Maybe (2,7) is a good candidate. But I think the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Since all 0 adjacent cells are uncovered, maybe (0,9) but that's invalid. Alternatively, (3,4) is already uncovered. I think I'll go with uncovering (3,4), but wait, (3,4) is already uncovered. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the current board in the input has rows with ?. Let's assume the correct board is 9x9, and the user pasted it incorrectly. Let's take row 3 as \"? ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\" → columns 0-8. So (3,0) and (3,1) are ?. Let's pick (3,0) to uncover. So the action would be 'uncover (3,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the rows are listed as separate lines. Wait, actually, the user provided the current board as multiple lines, each representing a row. Let me check the coordinates. The top-left is (0,0), so row 0, column 0 is the first cell of the first row.\n\nThe input shows the current board with cells that are either numbers, 'F' (flagged), or '?' (unknown). The goal is to either uncover all safe cells or correctly flag all 10 mines. The score is based on correct flags over total mines, but we want to win, so we need to either flag all 10 correctly or uncover all non-mine cells.\n\nFirst, let's note the current flags. The user mentioned \"Flags: 4\/29\", which means there are 29 flags placed, but only 4 are correct. Wait, that's a lot of flags. The total mines are 10, so having 29 flags is way over. So most of the 'F's on the board are incorrect. We need to unflag those, but the user hasn't done any unflags yet (Unflags: 0). But maybe first, let's look for safe cells to uncover.\n\nLet's go through each row and column to find cells that can be determined. Let's start with the first few rows where there are numbers and flags.\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ?, ?] Wait, wait, the board is 9x9, but each row here has 17 elements? That can't be right. Oh, maybe there's a formatting mistake. Wait, the original problem says the board is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Let me check again. The user's Current Board is written as multiple lines, but maybe each line is a row of 9 cells. Let's count the elements in the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" That's 17 elements. That's not 9. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, and the rows are actually 9 cells each, but the user pasted them incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 17x9 grid? No, the Minesweeper standard is 9x9 for beginner, 16x16 for intermediate, etc. The problem states 9x9, so 9 rows, 9 columns.\n\nWait, perhaps the Current Board is written with each row separated by a line, and each row has 9 cells. Let me check the lines again. Let's count the number of lines: the Current Board has 17 lines. That's 17 rows? But the problem says 9x9. That's conflicting. Maybe it's a mistake in the input. Alternatively, maybe the user made a formatting error when pasting the board. Let's assume that the board is 9x9, so 9 rows, 9 columns. Let's check the first line again. Maybe the user split the rows into multiple lines by mistake. For example, maybe the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\", the second part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", but that would make the first row have 9 cells and the next part another row. But that's unclear. This is a problem because without the correct board structure, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Current Board is presented as a single line with all cells, separated by spaces, and the user split it into multiple lines for readability. Let's count the total number of cells. Let's count the elements in each line:\n\nLine 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? → 17 elements\nLine 2: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ? → 17\nLine 3: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ? → 17\nLine 4: 1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ? → 17\nLine 5: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 6: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 7: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 8: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 9: ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 10: ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 → 17\nLine 11: ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 13: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 14: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? → 17\nLine 15: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 → 17\nLine 16: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 → 17\nLine 17: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 → 17\n\nThat's 17 lines, each with 17 elements. So maybe it's a 17x17 grid? But the problem says 9x9. This is confusing. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the \"Current Board\" is a typo and it's a 17x17 grid. Let's check the input format again. The problem says \"the board is a 9x9 grid\", so perhaps the Current Board provided is incorrect. But since we have to work with what's given, maybe we need to proceed despite the inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended each line to be a row of 9 cells, but split into two parts. For example, the first row is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" and the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", but that would make 16 cells, which is 16 columns. Still not 9. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is presented with each cell separated by spaces, and the rows are concatenated. Let's count the total number of cells. 17 lines × 17 elements = 289 cells. That's 17x17. Maybe the problem statement has a mistake, and the board is 17x17. Let's assume that. Then the coordinate (row, col) would be from (0,0) to (16,16).\n\nThe goal is to find a cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are '?' and have adjacent numbers that can help determine if they are safe.\n\nLet's look at row 8 (index 8), column 13: \"1 F 1 0 0\". So (8,13) is F. Let's check surrounding numbers. For example, row 14 (index 14) has \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\". So (14,11) is 3, (14,12) is 2, (14,13) is 1. The 3 at (14,11) has adjacent cells. Let's see which cells are adjacent to (14,11). Adjacent cells are (13,10), (13,11), (13,12), (14,10), (14,12), (15,10), (15,11), (15,12). Let's check those cells.\n\nRow 13: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1\" → (13,10) is ?, (13,11) is ?, (13,12) is ?, (13,13) is 1, (13,14) is 0, (13,15) is 1, (13,16) is 1.\n\nRow 14: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\" → (14,10) is 0, (14,11) is 3, (14,12) is 2, (14,13) is 1, (14,14) is 0, (14,15) is 1, (14,16) is ?.\n\nRow 15: \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → (15,10) is ?, (15,11) is 1, (15,12) is 0, (15,13) is 0, (15,14) is 0, (15,15) is 1, (15,16) is 1.\n\nSo the 3 at (14,11) has adjacent cells: (13,10), (13,11), (13,12), (14,10)=0, (14,12)=2, (15,10), (15,11)=1, (15,12)=0. The 0 at (14,10) means all adjacent cells to (14,10) are safe, so (13,9), (13,10), (13,11), (14,9), (14,11), (15,9), (15,10), (15,11) are all safe. Since (14,10) is 0, all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. Therefore, (13,10), (13,11), (13,12) (wait, (14,10)'s adjacent is (13,9), (13,10), (13,11), (14,9), (14,11), (15,9), (15,10), (15,11)). So (13,10), (13,11), (15,10), (15,11) are adjacent to (14,10)=0, so they must be safe (no mines). Therefore, (13,10), (13,11), (15,10), (15,11) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's check (15,11): in row 15, it's \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\" → (15,11) is 1. Wait, no, (15,11) is part of the row. Let me index correctly. Rows are 0-16, columns 0-16.\n\nRow 14 (index 14) columns 0-16: [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, ?] → Wait, that's 13 elements. This is getting too confusing. Maybe the board is presented incorrectly, and the user made a mistake. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to look for a cell that is marked as '?' and has an adjacent 0, which would mean it's safe. For example, in the first row, there's a 0. If a cell is adjacent to a 0, all its adjacent cells are safe. Let's assume that in row 0, column 0 is 0. Then (0,0) is 0, so all adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) are safe. If those cells are '?', we can uncover them. But in the first line, the first elements are \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1...\", so (0,0)=0, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1. So (0,5)=0, which is a 0. The adjacent cells to (0,5) would be (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,4) is 2, (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2 (from row 2: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2...\"), (1,5) is 0, (1,6) is 1. Since (0,5) is 0, all adjacent cells have 0 mines. So (0,5) is 0, so (0,4) is 2 (which is a number, already uncovered), (0,6) is 0 (uncovered), (1,4) is 2 (uncovered), (1,5) is 0 (uncovered), (1,6) is 1 (uncovered). So no '?' there.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → Let's assume (4,1) is '?'. The cell to the left is (4,0)=1, right is (4,2)=2. The cell above (3,1) is '?', below (5,1) is '?'. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and has an adjacent number that equals the number of adjacent flags. For example, if a cell has a number 1, and there's 1 flag adjacent, then the other adjacent '?' are safe. But since there are 29 flags, many of which are incorrect, this might not be reliable.\n\nAlternatively, since the score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29 (since 4\/29 ≈ 0.1379), that means 4 flags are correct, 25 are incorrect. So most 'F's are wrong. So we should unflag some, but the user asked for an action, which could be uncover, flag, or unflag. But the example shows uncover as an option. Since the game ends if we uncover a mine, we need to find a safe cell.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell. Any 0 means all 8 adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. For example, in row 0, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=2, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1. All uncovered. In row 1, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,4)=2, (1,6)=1, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (0,6)=0, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, columns 7 and 8 are 0: \"1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → (4,9)=0, (4,10)=0. Adjacent to (4,9)=0: (3,8)=2, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,10)=0, (5,8)=0, (5,9)=1, (5,10)=?. Since (4,9)=0, (5,10) should be safe. (5,10) is '?', so we can uncover (5,10).\n\nLet me verify. (4,9) is 0, so all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. The adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,8): 2 (from row 3: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\" → (3,8)=2)\n\n(3,9): 1 (row 3, column 9: 1)\n\n(3,10): 1 (row 3, column 10: 1)\n\n(4,8): 1 (row 4, column 8: 1)\n\n(4,10): 0 (row 4, column 10: 0)\n\n(5,8): 0 (row 5: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → column 8 is 0)\n\n(5,9): 1 (row 5, column 9: 1)\n\n(5,10): ? (row 5, column 10: 1? Wait row 5 is \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → columns 0-16: [?,?,?,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,2,?,1,0,1,1]. So (5,10) is 1 (column 10), (5,11)=2. So (4,9) is 0 (row 4, column 9). The adjacent cell (5,9) is 1 (row 5, column 9). (4,9) being 0 means (5,9) has 0 mines, but (5,9) is 1, which is a number, so that's okay. The cell (5,10) is 1 (row 5, column 10), which is uncovered. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 8, column 12: \"1 F 1 0 0\" → (8,12)=1, (8,13)=F, (8,14)=1. The 1 at (8,12) has adjacent cells. If (8,13) is a flag (F), but it's possibly incorrect. If (8,12)=1, and there's 1 F adjacent, then the other adjacent cells are safe. But since F could be wrong, this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a cell that is '?' and is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 7 is 0: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\" → (5,7)=0. Adjacent cells to (5,7)=0 are (4,6)=1, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=1, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=1, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0. All these are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 6, column 7 is 0: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\" → (6,7)=0. Adjacent cells: (5,6)=1, (5,7)=0, (5,8)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=0, (7,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 7 is 0: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → (7,7)=0. Adjacent cells are (6,6)=0, (6,7)=0, (6,8)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,8)=0, (8,6)=?, (8,7)=?, (8,8)=?. So (8,6), (8,7), (8,8) are adjacent to (7,7)=0, so they are safe. Let's check row 8: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" → (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Oh, they are already uncovered as 0. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 0: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" → (8,4)=0. Adjacent cells: (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=1, (8,5)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 9, column 5 is 0: \"? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\" → (9,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=1, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=2, (10,5)=1, (10,6)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 10, column 6 is 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,6)=1. Adjacent cells: (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0, (10,5)=1, (10,7)=1, (11,5)=?, (11,6)=?, (11,7)=?. Since (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0 are safe, so (10,6)=1's adjacent mines are in (10,5)=1 (already a number), (10,7)=1 (number), (11,5), (11,6), (11,7). But not sure.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Since the user probably made a mistake in the board formatting, but the task is to output an action, I'll pick a cell that's likely safe. Let's assume that in row 3, column 4 is '1' (from the input example, but not sure). Alternatively, looking at the first line, there's a '?' at (0,9), (0,10), etc. But without a clear board, it's hard. Maybe the best guess is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, if there's a 0 at (5,7), then (6,8) is 0, which is safe. But I'll go with a random safe cell. Let's say (5,10) is a '?', but I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's pick (3,4) as in the example. Wait, the example input has 'uncover (3,4)', but that's just an example. Maybe (3,4) is a safe cell. Let me check row 3: \"1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\" → (3,4)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. The cell (3,5) is F, which is a flag. Since (3,4)=1, and there's 1 F adjacent, the other cells are safe. But since the flag might be wrong, if (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4)=1 is correct. If (3,5) is not a mine, then there's a mine in the adjacent cells. But since there are 29 flags and only 4 correct, (3,5) is likely incorrect. So (3,4)=1 has 0 mines adjacent (if the flag is wrong), so the adjacent '?' could be safe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, let's pick a cell that's '?' and has an adjacent 0. For example, row 0, column 9 is '?'. If (0,8)=1, which is a number, maybe (0,9) is safe. But I'll go with uncovering (3,4) as a guess.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move for the Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the way it's presented here is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe the user made a formatting error? Let me check. Oh, the current board is listed as multiple lines, each with 17 elements. That can't be right. Wait, no, Minesweeper is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Let me count the elements in the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" – that's 17 elements. That must be a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and the actual board is 17 rows? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the user pasted the board incorrectly, maybe each line is a row of the 9x9 grid but split into parts. Wait, the initial problem says the board is 9x9, so 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let me check the \"Current Board\" section again. Oh, there are 17 lines listed under \"Current Board\". That's probably a formatting error. Maybe the user intended each line to be a row, but there are 17 rows instead of 9. That's confusing. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed with the information given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"Current Board\" is presented as a single line split into multiple lines for readability. Let's see: the first line is \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", which is 17 elements. If we consider that maybe each row is 9 cells, then 9 rows would have 81 cells. Let's count the total number of elements in the \"Current Board\" section. Let's list each line's element count:\n\n1. 17\n2. 17\n3. 17\n4. 17\n5. 17\n6. 17\n7. 17\n8. 17\n9. 17\n10. 17\n11. 17\n12. 17\n13. 17\n14. 17\n15. 17\n16. 17\n17. 17\n\nThat's 17 lines, each with 17 elements. 17x17=289 cells, which is way more than 9x9=81. So this must be a formatting error. Maybe the user intended to present a 9x9 board but pasted it incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different size, but the problem statement says 9x9. Hmm. Maybe the \"Current Board\" is a typo, and the actual board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells, but the user split each row into two parts. For example, the first row might be \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" and the next part is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", but that's 9 + 8 = 17. That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Since the problem says it's a 9x9 grid, I'll proceed under that assumption, but perhaps the current board is misformatted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Current Board\" is correct, and the game is not 9x9 but 17x17. But the problem statement says 9x9. This is a problem. Maybe the user made a mistake, but perhaps I should focus on the action. Let's look at the input examples: the actions are 'uncover (row, col)', 'flag (row, col)', etc. The coordinates are (row, col), with (0,0) being top-left.\n\nGiven that the score is 0.1379, which is 4\/29 (since 4\/29 ≈ 0.1379), that means the user has flagged 4 mines, but there are 29 flags in total (since Flags: 4\/29). The problem says the final score is correct flags \/ total mines (which is 10). So 4 correct flags out of 10, but they have 29 flags placed (so 25 are incorrect). The goal is to flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells.\n\nThe game ends at 100th epoch or if a mine is uncovered. So we need to make a move that helps towards winning.\n\nLooking at the current board, perhaps there are cells that can be safely uncovered. For example, if a cell shows a number, say 1, and adjacent cells have flags, we can use that to determine safe cells. But since the board is misformatted, it's hard to analyze. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to present a 9x9 board, and the \"Current Board\" lines are each row, but with a typo. Let's assume that each row is 9 cells. Let's take the first line: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (first 9 elements). Then the next line is \"? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" but that's 8 elements. No, that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"Current Board\" is a single line with 81 elements (9x9) split into multiple lines. Let's count: 17 lines, but perhaps each line is a part. Let's concatenate all the lines into one string and split by spaces. Let's see:\n\nOriginal \"Current Board\" lines (each line is a string separated by spaces):\n\nLine 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nLine 2: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nLine 3: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\nLine 4: 1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\nLine 5: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\nLine 6: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\nLine 7: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\nLine 8: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nLine 9: ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\nLine 10: ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\nLine 11: ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nLine 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 0\nLine 13: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1\nLine 14: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\nLine 15: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\nLine 16: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0\nLine 17: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, concatenating all these into a single list of elements:\n\nLet's count how many elements that is. Each line has 17 elements, 17 lines: 17*17=289 elements. That's way too many. So this must be a mistake. Since the problem statement says 9x9, perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the board. Maybe the actual board is 9 rows, each with 9 cells, and the rest is a mistake. For example, maybe the first 9 lines are the board, each with 9 cells. Let's check line 1: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1\" (first 9 elements). Line 2: \"0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2\" (first 9). Line 3: \"1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2\" (first 9). Line 4: \"1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1\" (first 9). Line 5: \"? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0\" (first 9). Line 6: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" (first 9). Line 7: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" (first 9). Line 8: \"? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0\" (first 9). Line 9: \"? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0\" (first 9). That makes 9 rows of 9 cells each. Let's assume that's the actual current board.\n\nSo the board would be:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2]\nRow 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2]\nRow 3: [1, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1]\nRow 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 7: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, let's analyze this. The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. Let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. For example, in row 4, column 7 and 8 are 0. In Minesweeper, a 0 means none of the adjacent cells have mines, so all adjacent ? cells can be uncovered. Let's check row 4, column 7 (cell (4,7)) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). Let's list their current state:\n\n(3,6): 2 (from row 3: [1, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1] → index 6 is 2)\n(3,7): 1 (index 7)\n(3,8): 1 (index 8)\n(4,6): 1 (row 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0] → index 6 is 1)\n(4,8): 0 (index 8)\n(5,6): 0 (row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → index 6 is 0)\n(5,7): 0 (index 7)\n(5,8): 0 (index 8)\n\nSince (4,7) is 0, all adjacent cells are safe. But some of them are already uncovered (like (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, etc.). The adjacent ? cells would be in row 3, column 1 (since row 3, column 1 is ?). Wait, row 3, column 1 is (3,1), which is ?. Let's check if (3,1) is adjacent to any 0 cells.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, column 8 (cell (4,8)) which is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (4,7), (5,7), (5,8). All of these are already uncovered (values 1,1,0,0,0), so no ? cells there.\n\nLooking at row 5, columns 4-8 are 0. For example, cell (5,4) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). Let's check these:\n\n(4,3): 1 (row 4, index 3)\n(4,4): 1 (index 4)\n(4,5): 1 (index 5)\n(5,3): 2 (row 5, index 3)\n(5,5): 0 (index 5)\n(6,3): 2 (row 6, index 3)\n(6,4): 0 (index 4)\n(6,5): 0 (index 5)\n\nSo (5,4) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe. Are any of these adjacent cells ? cells? (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are ? (row 4: [?, ?, ?, 1, ...]). (5,0), (5,1), (5,2) are ? (row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, ...]). (6,0), (6,1), (6,2) are ? (row 6: [?, ?, ?, 2, ...]). These are all in the first three columns of rows 4,5,6. Are any of these adjacent to 0 cells? Let's see: (4,0) is in row 4, column 0. Its adjacent cells would be (3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1). (3,0) is 1 (row 3, index 0: 1), (3,1) is ? (row 3, index 1), (4,1) is ? (row 4, index 1), (5,0) is ? (row 5, index 0), (5,1) is ? (row 5, index 1). Not directly adjacent to a 0, but maybe other 0 cells.\n\nLooking at row 8, column 4 is 0 (row 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] → index 4 is 0). Its adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5) – but wait, the grid is 9x9, so rows and columns are 0-8. So row 8 is the last row. So (8,4) adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5). (7,3) is 2 (row 7, index 3), (7,4) is 0 (row 7, index 4), (7,5) is 0 (row 7, index 5), (8,3) is 1 (row 8, index 3), (8,5) is 0 (row 8, index 5). So (8,4) is 0, but adjacent cells are already uncovered.\n\nAnother area: row 0, column 8 is 1 (row 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]). So (0,8) has value 1, meaning one mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are (0,7), (1,7), (1,8). (0,7) is 0 (row 0, index 7), (1,7) is 1 (row 1, index 7), (1,8) is 2 (row 1, index 8). So the mine adjacent to (0,8) could be in (1,8), but (1,8) is 2, which is a number, so it's already uncovered. So maybe (0,8) is safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 5 is F (flagged). The user has 29 flags, 4 correct. So this flag might be incorrect. Let's check if (3,5) is a mine. The cell (3,5) is flagged. Let's look at adjacent cells. (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. Adjacent cells are (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). Let's get their values:\n\n(2,4): 2 (row 2, index 4: 2)\n(2,5): 1 (row 2, index 5: 1)\n(2,6): 2 (row 2, index 6: 2)\n(3,4): 1 (row 3, index 4: 1)\n(3,6): 2 (row 3, index 6: 2)\n(4,4): 1 (row 4, index 4: 1)\n(4,5): 1 (row 4, index 5: 1)\n(4,6): 1 (row 4, index 6: 1)\n\nIf (3,5) is a mine, then each of these adjacent cells should have their count incremented by 1. For example, (3,4) is 1, which would mean it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4) has that mine as one of its adjacent, so the other adjacent cells of (3,4) should have 0 mines. (3,4) adjacent cells are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3): 1 (row 2, index 3: 1), (2,4): 2, (2,5): 1, (3,3): 1 (row 3, index 3: 1), (3,5): F (flagged), (4,3): 1 (row 4, index 3: 1), (4,4): 1, (4,5): 1. If (3,5) is a mine, then (3,4) has 1 mine (the flagged one), so the rest of the adjacent cells (which are all numbers) should not have mines. That seems possible, but maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are ? and can be safely uncovered. For example, in row 2, column 7 is ? (row 2: [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ?, 2]). Let's check the adjacent cells of (2,7). The value of (2,7) is ?, and its adjacent cells are (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). Their values are:\n\n(1,6): 1 (row 1, index 6: 1)\n(1,7): 1 (row 1, index 7: 1)\n(1,8): 2 (row 1, index 8: 2)\n(2,6): 2 (row 2, index 6: 2)\n(2,8): 2 (row 2, index 8: 2)\n(3,6): 2 (row 3, index 6: 2)\n(3,7): 1 (row 3, index 7: 1)\n(3,8): 1 (row 3, index 8: 1)\n\nThe cell (2,7) is ?, but we don't know its value yet. Maybe we can find a cell with a known number that can help. For example, row 3, column 0 is 1 (row 3: [1, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1]). (3,0) has value 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0): 1 (row 2, index 0: 1), (2,1): 1 (row 2, index 1: 1), (3,1): ? (row 3, index 1), (4,0): ? (row 4, index 0), (4,1): ? (row 4, index 1). So the mine could be in (3,1), (4,0), or (4,1). But not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for 0 cells, as they automatically uncover all adjacent cells. For example, row 4, column 7 and 8 are 0. Let's check row 4, column 7 (4,7) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6) is 2, (3,7) is 1, (3,8) is 1, (4,6) is 1, (4,8) is 0, (5,6) is 0, (5,7) is 0, (5,8) is 0. All these are uncovered, so no ? cells here.\n\nRow 5, column 4 is 0 (row 5: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). (5,4) adjacent cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (5,3), (5,5), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5). (4,3) is 1, (4,4) is 1, (4,5) is 1, (5,3) is 2, (5,5) is 0, (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 0, (6,5) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 4 is 0 (row 7: [?, ?, ?, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). (7,4) adjacent cells are (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (7,3), (7,5), (8,3), (8,4), (8,5). (6,3) is 2, (6,4) is 0, (6,5) is 0, (7,3) is 2, (7,5) is 0, (8,3) is 1, (8,4) is 0, (8,5) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 4 is 0 (row 8: [?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). Adjacent cells are (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,3), (8,5). (7,3) is 2, (7,4) is 0, (7,5) is 0, (8,3) is 1, (8,5) is 0. All uncovered.\n\nSo the 0 cells don't have adjacent ? cells. Let's look for cells with numbers that have more flags than the number, which would mean the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, if a cell has a number 2 and there are 3 flags around it, then one of the flags is wrong, but that's not helpful. Or if a cell has number 1 and 1 flag around it, then the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 2: 2 (row 0: [0, 0, 2, F, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1]). (0,2) has value 2, adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1) is 0, (0,3) is F (flagged), (1,1) is 0, (1,2) is 2, (1,3) is F (flagged). So adjacent flags: (0,3) and (1,3) are F. So two flags. The cell (0,2) has value 2, which matches the number of flags. So that means those two flags are correct mines. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Since the user has 4 correct flags, maybe these are two of them. That's good.\n\nSimilarly, row 0, column 4 is 2 (row 0, index 4: 2). Adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). (0,3) is F, (0,5) is 0, (1,3) is F, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 0. So two flags, which matches the 2. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines, which we already thought.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 2 (row 1, index 2: 2). Adjacent cells: (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. So two flags (0,3 and 1,3), which matches the 2. So again, confirms those are mines.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is 2 (row 1, index 4: 2). Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. Two flags, which matches 2. So again, (0,3) and (1,3) are mines.\n\nSo these flags at (0,3) and (1,3) are correct. The user has 4 correct flags, so there are two more correct flags. Let's see other F cells.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is F (row 3, index 5: F). Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,5) is in row 3, column 5. Adjacent cells are (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=2, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1, (4,6)=1. The cell (2,5) has value 1. If (3,5) is a mine, then (2,5) has one mine (this one), so the other adjacent cells of (2,5) should have 0 mines. (2,5) adjacent cells are (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0, (1,6)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,6)=2, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=F, (3,6)=2. So (2,5)=1, which would mean 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (3,5) is a mine, that's 1, so others are safe. That's possible.\n\nRow 8, column 13 is F, but wait, earlier we assumed the board is 9x9, so row 8, column 13 is out of bounds. That must be part of the formatting error. Let's ignore that.\n\nAnother F cell: row 0, column 3 and row 1, column 3 are F (from earlier analysis). Let's confirm they are correct. Since the cells around them (row 0, column 2 and row 1, column 2) have value 2, and there are two flags adjacent, those flags are correct. So (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. So that's two correct flags.\n\nThe user has 4 correct flags, so there are two more. Let's look for other F cells. The current board as per our assumed 9x9 has F at (0,3), (1,3), (3,5), and maybe others (but in the initial problem statement, Flags: 4\/29, so 4 correct, 29 total flags). So 29 flags placed, 4 correct.\n\nNow, to find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are ? and have adjacent numbers that indicate they are safe. For example, in row 2, column 7 is ?. Let's check the cell (2,7). Its adjacent cells are (1,6)=1, (1,7)=1, (1,8)=2, (2,6)=2, (2,8)=2, (3,6)=2, (3,7)=1, (3,8)=1. The value of (2,7) is unknown. If we uncover it, if it's a number, we can get more info. But maybe there's a better cell.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 1: ? (row 3, index 1: ?). Adjacent cells are (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?. The cell (3,0) has value 1, which means one mine in its adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0)=1, (2,1)=1, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?. So if (3,0) is 1, there's one mine among these five cells. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, columns 0-2: all ?. (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). Adjacent cells include (3,0)=1, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (5,0)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, etc. Maybe these are safe, but not sure.\n\nAnother approach: since the game ends at 100 epochs, and we need to make moves towards uncovering all safe cells. The safest moves are to uncover cells that are adjacent to 0s, but we already checked those. Alternatively, uncover cells that are ? and not adjacent to any numbers, but that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 8, column 3: 1 (row 8, index 3: 1). Adjacent cells are (7,2)=?, (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,2)=?, (8,4)=0, (9,2)=? (but row 9 doesn't exist). So (8,3) is 1, adjacent cells are (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (8,2), (8,4). (7,3)=2, (7,4)=0, (8,4)=0. So the mine could be in (7,2) or (8,2). But (7,2) is ? and (8,2) is ?.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's likely to be safe. For example, row 5, column 0: ?. It's in the first column, row 5. Adjacent cells are (4,0)=?, (4,1)=?, (4,2)=?, (5,1)=?, (5,2)=?, (6,0)=?, (6,1)=?, (6,2)=?. All ?. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 2, column 7: ?. Let's assume we uncover it. If it's a number, we can get more info. Maybe it's a 1 or 2. Alternatively, look at row 3, column 1: ?. Uncovering that might reveal a number.\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a known number with low risk. For example, row 2, column 7 is ?. Let's check the cell (2,7). Its adjacent cells have numbers, but none of them are 0, so it's not guaranteed safe, but maybe it's a low-numbered cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's ? and has many adjacent uncovered cells. For example, row 2, column 7 is surrounded by several numbers, so uncovering it might give us info about nearby mines.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the initial problem's score: 4\/10 correct flags, 29 flags. So there are 6 mines unflagged, and 25 incorrect flags. To win, we need to either flag all 10 or uncover all safe cells. Uncovering safe cells is probably better since there are many incorrect flags.\n\nLet's assume that the cell (3,4) is in the board. Wait, the example action is 'uncover (3,4)'. Let's check where (3,4) is. In row 3, column 4. From our assumed 9x9 board, row 3 is [1, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1]. So column 4 is index 4, which has value 1. So (3,4) is already uncovered (value 1). So that can't be the move.\n\nWait, maybe the board is not 9x9 but 17x17, as per the current board's lines. Let's check the original problem statement again. Oh, the user wrote: \"Current Board:\" followed by 17 lines, each with 17 elements. That's 17x17. But the problem statement says \"the board is a 9x9 grid\". That's a contradiction. This must be a mistake. Perhaps the user intended to present a 17x17 board, and the problem statement has a typo. Let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nAssuming the board is 17x17, with rows 0-16 and columns 0-16. Let's look at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 F 2 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 1: 0 0 2 F 2 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 2: 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 2 ?\nRow 3: 1 ? 2 1 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 ?\nRow 4: ? ? ? 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 1 1\nRow 5: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? 2 0 0 0\nRow 6: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 ? 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: ? ? ? 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 8: ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\nRow 9: ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\nRow 10: ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 0\nRow 12: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1\nRow 13: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ?\nRow 14: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow 15: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 16: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, this is a 17x17 grid. Let's confirm: 17 rows (0-16), each with 17 columns (0-16). The problem statement's initial rule says 9x9, but that's likely a mistake. Let's proceed with 17x17.\n\nNow, the goal is to find a cell to uncover. Let's look for safe cells. For example, cells with 0, which uncover all adjacent cells. Let's find 0s in the board.\n\nRow 0, columns 0-2: 0,0,2. Column 4: 2, columns 5-7: 0,0,0. Column 8: 1. Column 9: ?, column 10:1, columns 11-14:0,0,0,1, column 15:?, column 16:?.\n\nRow 1: columns 0-1:0,0, column 2:2, column3:F, column4:2, column5:0, columns6-7:1,1, column8:2, column9:?, column10:1, columns11-14:0,0,0,1, column15:?, column16:?.\n\nRow 2: columns0-1:1,1, column2:2, column3:1, column4:2, column5:1, column6:2, column7:?, column8:2, column9:1, columns10-13:1,0,0,0, column14:1, column15:2, column16:?.\n\nRow 3: column0:1, column1:?, column2:2, column3:1, column4:1, column5:F, column6:2, column7:1, column8:1, columns9-10:0,0, column11:1, columns12-14:1,1,0, column15:1, column16:?.\n\nRow 4: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:1, columns4-5:1,1, column6:1, columns7-8:0,0, column9:1, columns10-11:1,2, column12:?, column13:1, column14:0, columns15-16:1,1.\n\nRow 5: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:2, columns4-8:0,0,0,0,0, column9:1, columns10-12:?,?,?, column13:2, columns14-16:0,0,0.\n\nRow 6: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:2, columns4-8:0,0,0,0,0, column9:1, columns10-11:1,2, column12:?, column13:1, columns14-16:0,0,0.\n\nRow 7: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:2, columns4-8:0,0,0,0,0, columns9-10:0,0, column11:1, columns12-13:2,2, column14:1, columns15-16:0,0.\n\nRow 8: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:1, columns4-8:0,0,0,0,0, columns9-11:0,0,0, column12:1, column13:F, column14:1, columns15-16:0,0.\n\nRow 9: columns0-2:?,?,?, column3:1, columns4-8:1,0,0,0,0, columns9-11:0,0,0, column12:1, columns13-14:1,1, column15:0, column16:0.\n\nRow 10: columns0-3:?,?,?,?, column4:2, columns5-7:1,1,1, column8:2, columns9-10:1,1, columns11-16:0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nRow 11: columns0-9:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, column10:2, columns11-13:2,2,1, columns14-16:0,0,0.\n\nRow 12: columns0-10:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, columns11-12:?,?,?, column13:1, column14:0, columns15-16:1,1.\n\nRow 13: columns0-10:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, column11:3, column12:2, column13:1, column14:0, column15:1, column16:?.\n\nRow 14: columns0-10:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, column11:1, column12:0, columns13-14:0,0, column15:1, column16:1.\n\nRow 15: columns0-10:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, column11:1, column12:1, columns13-14:0,0, columns15-16:0,0.\n\nRow 16: columns0-11:?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?, column12:1, column13:0, columns14-16:0,0,0.\n\nNow, let's look for 0 cells. For example, row 4, columns 7-8: 0,0 (cells (4,7) and (4,8)). A 0 means all adjacent cells are safe and should be uncovered. Let's check (4,7):\n\nAdjacent cells to (4,7) (row 4, column 7) are:\n\n(row 3, column 6), (row 3, column 7), (row 3, column 8),\n(row 4, column 6), (row 4, column 8),\n(row 5, column 6), (row 5, column 7), (row 5, column 8)\n\nValues:\n\n(row 3,6)=2, (row3,7)=1, (row3,8)=1,\n(row4,6)=1, (row4,8)=0,\n(row5,6)=0 (row5: [?,?,?,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,?,?,2,0,0,0] → column6=0),\n(row5,7)=0 (column7=0),\n(row5,8)=0 (column8=0)\n\nAll these are already uncovered (values are numbers), so no ? cells here.\n\nRow 5, columns 4-8: 0,0,0,0,0 (cells (5,4) to (5,8)). Let's take (5,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row4,3), (row4,4), (row4,5),\n(row5,3), (row5,5),\n(row6,3), (row6,4), (row6,5)\n\nValues:\n\n(row4,3)=1, (row4,4)=1, (row4,5)=1,\n(row5,3)=2, (row5,5)=0,\n(row6,3)=2, (row6,4)=0, (row6,5)=0\n\nAll uncovered, no ?.\n\nRow 7, columns 4-8: 0,0,0,0,0. (7,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row6,3), (row6,4), (row6,5),\n(row7,3), (row7,5),\n(row8,3), (row8,4), (row8,5)\n\nValues:\n\n(row6,3)=2, (row6,4)=0, (row6,5)=0,\n(row7,3)=2, (row7,5)=0,\n(row8,3)=1, (row8,4)=0, (row8,5)=0\n\nAll uncovered.\n\nRow 8, columns 4-8: 0,0,0,0,0. (8,4)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row7,3), (row7,4), (row7,5),\n(row8,3), (row8,5),\n(row9,3), (row9,4), (row9,5)\n\nValues:\n\n(row7,3)=2, (row7,4)=0, (row7,5)=0,\n(row8,3)=1, (row8,5)=0,\n(row9,3)=1, (row9,4)=1, (row9,5)=0\n\nAll uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that have adjacent flags equal to the number, meaning other adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0, column 3 is F (flagged). Let's check row 0, column 2: value 2. Adjacent cells to (0,2) are (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (0,1)=0, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=F. So two flags, which matches the value 2. So (0,3) and (1,3) are correct mines.\n\nSimilarly, row 0, column 4 has value 2. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=0. Two flags, so (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 2 has value 2. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2, (0,3)=F, (1,1)=0, (1,3)=F, (2,1)=1, (2,2)=2, (2,3)=1. Two flags, so (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 4 has value 2. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=F, (0,4)=2, (0,5)=0, (1,3)=F, (1,5)=0, (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1. Two flags, so (0,3) and (1,3) are mines. Correct.\n\nSo these two flags are correct. The user has 4 correct flags, so there are two more. Let's look for other F cells.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is F (row3, column5). Let's check row3, column4: value 1. Adjacent cells to (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5). (2,3)=1, (2,4)=2, (2,5)=1, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=F, (4,3)=1, (4,4)=1, (4,5)=1. So (3,4)=1, which has one adjacent flag. If that flag is correct, then the other adjacent cells are safe. So (3,5) might be a correct mine.\n\nRow 8, column 13 is F (row8, column13). Let's check row8, column12: value 1. Adjacent cells to (8,12) are (7,11), (7,12), (7,13), (8,11), (8,13), (9,11), (9,12), (9,13). (7,11)=1, (7,12)=2, (7,13)=2, (8,11)=0, (8,13)=F, (9,11)=0, (9,12)=1, (9,13)=1. (8,12)=1, which has one adjacent flag. So if (8,13) is a mine, that's correct. So that's another possible correct flag.\n\nSo (0,3), (1,3), (3,5), (8,13) are likely correct flags (4 correct, matching the score 4\/10).\n\nNow, to find a cell to uncover. Let's look for a ? cell that is adjacent to a number with known mines, indicating it's safe.\n\nFor example, row 2, column 7 is ? (row2, column7). Let's check its adjacent cells:\n\n(row1,6)=1, (row1,7)=1, (row1,8)=2,\n(row2,6)=2, (row2,8)=2,\n(row3,6)=2, (row3,7)=1, (row3,8)=1\n\nThe cell (2,7) is ?. Let's see if any of its adjacent cells can help. For example, row1, column8 has value 2. Adjacent cells to (1,8) are (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=1, (1,9)=?, (2,7)=?, (2,8)=2, (2,9)=1. (1,8)=2, so two mines in adjacent cells. Currently, there are no flags here, so the two mines could be in (0,9), (1,9), (2,7), etc. Not helpful.\n\nAnother cell: row 4, column 12 is ? (row4, column12). Adjacent cells:\n\n(row3,11), (row3,12), (row3,13),\n(row4,11), (row4,13),\n(row5,11), (row5,12), (row5,13)\n\nValues:\n\n(row3,11)=1, (row3,12)=1, (row3,13)=1,\n(row4,11)=2, (row4,13)=1,\n(row5,11)=?, (row5,12)=?, (row5,13)=2\n\n(row4,12)=? is adjacent to (row4,11)=2. (row4,11)=2 has adjacent cells: (3,10), (3,11), (3,12), (4,10), (4,12), (5,10), (5,11), (5,12). (3,10)=0, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=1, (4,10)=1, (4,12)=?, (5,10)=?, (5,11)=?, (5,12)=?. So (4,11)=2, meaning two mines in adjacent cells. If there are no flags here, we can't be sure.\n\nAnother cell: row 5, column 10 is ? (row5, column10). Adjacent cells:\n\n(row4,9), (row4,10), (row4,11),\n(row5,9), (row5,11),\n(row6,9), (row6,10), (row6,11)\n\nValues:\n\n(row4,9)=1, (row4,10)=1, (row4,11)=2,\n(row5,9)=1, (row5,11)=?,\n(row6,9)=1, (row6,10)=1, (row6,11)=2\n\nNot helpful.\n\nLet's look at row 13, column 11: 3 (row13, column11=3). Adjacent cells are (12,10), (12,11), (12,12), (13,10), (13,12), (14,10), (14,11), (14,12). (12,10)=?, (12,11)=?, (12,12)=?, (13,10)=?, (13,12)=2, (14,10)=?, (14,11)=1, (14,12)=0. (13,11)=3 means three mines in adjacent cells. There are no flags here, so risky to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's ? and has many adjacent 0s. For example, row 9, columns 4-8: 1,0,0,0,0 (row9, column4=1, column5=0, etc.). (9,5)=0. Adjacent cells are (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (9,4), (9,6), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6). (8,4)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=1, (9,6)=0, (10,4)=2, (10,5)=1, (10,6)=1. All uncovered, so no ?.\n\nAnother approach: since the user has 29 flags, many of which are incorrect, uncovering cells that are not flagged is better. Let's pick a ? cell that is not flagged. For example, row 0, column 9 is ? (row0, column9). Let's uncover that.\n\nBut maybe there's a better cell. Let's look at row 3, column 1: ? (row3, column1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(row2,0), (row2,1), (row2,2),\n(row3,0), (row3,2),\n(row4,0), (row4,1), (row4,2)\n\nValues:\n\n(row2,0)=1, (row2,1)=1, (row2,2)=2,\n(row3,0)=1, (row3,2)=2,\n(row4,0)=?, (row4,1)=?, (row4,2)=?\n\nNot helpful, but maybe it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 7: ?. Uncovering this might reveal a number that helps.\n\nBut perhaps the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, row 4, column 7 and 8 are 0, but their adjacent cells are already uncovered. What about row 7, column 9 and 10: 0,0 (row7, column9=0, column10=0). Let's check (7,9)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row6,8), (row6,9), (row6,10),\n(row7,8), (row7,10),\n(row8,8), (row8,9), (row8,10)\n\nValues:\n\n(row6,8)=0, (row6,9)=1, (row6,10)=1,\n(row7,8)=0, (row7,10)=0,\n(row8,8)=0, (row8,9)=0, (row8,10)=0\n\nAll uncovered, so no ?.\n\nAnother 0 cell: row 8, columns 9-11: 0,0,0 (row8, column9=0, column10=0, column11=0). (8,9)=0. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row7,8), (row7,9), (row7,10),\n(row8,8), (row8,10),\n(row9,8), (row9,9), (row9,10)\n\nValues:\n\n(row7,8)=0, (row7,9)=0, (row7,10)=0,\n(row8,8)=0, (row8,10)=0,\n(row9,8)=0, (row9,9)=0, (row9,10)=0\n\nAll uncovered.\n\nHmm. Maybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that's in an area with many 0s, which are likely safe. For example, row 5, column 9 is 1 (row5, column9=1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(row4,8), (row4,9), (row4,10),\n(row5,8), (row5,10),\n(row6,8), (row6,9), (row6,10)\n\nValues:\n\n(row4,8)=0, (row4,9)=1, (row4,10)=1,\n(row5,8)=0, (row5,10)=?,\n(row6,8)=0, (row6,9)=1, (row6,10)=1\n\n(row5,9)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells with ? are (row5,10). So if (row5,9)=1, then (row5,10) could be a mine, but since it's ?, uncovering (row5,10) might be risky. Alternatively, if (row5,10) is not a mine, then it's safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's in a corner with many ? but maybe safe. For example, row 16, column 12 is 1 (row16, column12=1). Adjacent cells:\n\n(row15,11), (row15,12), (row15,13),\n(row16,11), (row16,13),\n(17,11), (17,12), (17,13) – but row17 doesn't exist.\n\nSo (16,12)=1 has adjacent cells (15,11)=1, (15,12)=1, (15,13)=0, (16,11)=?, (16,13)=0. So one mine in (16,11). Uncovering (16,11) might be safe if it's not a mine.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll pick a cell that's likely safe. Let's choose row 3, column 4. Wait, row3, column4 has value 1 (from row3: [1, ?, 2, 1, 1, F, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, ?]). So (3,4) is already uncovered. Not a valid move.\n\nAnother cell: row 0, column 9 is ?. Let's uncover (0,9).\n\nAlternatively, row 2, column 7 is ?. Let's choose that.\n\nBut the example action is 'uncover (3,4)', but that's already uncovered. Maybe the correct move is to uncover a cell like (5,10).\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 4, column 12: ?. Let's uncover (4,12).\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the information, I'll choose to uncover a cell that's ? and in an area with low numbers. Let's say (5,10).\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,10)","uncover (5,10)"],"unflags":0,"seed":9,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

I need to play Minesweeper. The board is 9x9, so rows and columns are from 0 to 8. The current board is all '?', which means all cells are unknown. The first move is usually to uncover a cell. Since all are unknown, maybe pick a corner or the center. Let's go with (0,0) as a starting point. Wait, but sometimes the first move in Minesweeper doesn't hit a mine, but the rules here say the game ends if you uncover a mine. So I need to pick a safe first move. But since I don't have any info, any cell is possible. Let's just choose (0,0). So the action would be 'uncover (0,0)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what action to take in the Minesweeper game. The current board is all '?' except the first row, which has a '1' at the first position. Wait, the board is supposed to be 9x9, but the current display shows 13 rows? Maybe that's a formatting error. Let's focus on the rules.\n\nFirst, the game starts with a 9x9 grid, 10 mines. The input commands are uncover, flag, unflag. The win condition is flagging all mines correctly or uncovering all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nThe current board shows the first row as \"1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\", which probably is a typo. Maybe it's a 9x9, so rows 0-8, columns 0-8. The first cell (0,0) is '1', which means it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So those three cells have a total of 1 mine.\n\nSince the game just started, maybe the best first move is to uncover a cell that's safe. But since (0,0) is already uncovered as 1, perhaps the adjacent cells are the next to check. But wait, the first move in Minesweeper is usually safe, but here maybe (0,0) was already uncovered. So the player needs to make a move.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial board has (0,0) uncovered as 1. So the adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) have 1 mine. To proceed, maybe uncover a cell that's not adjacent to (0,0) first, like (2,2), which is far away. That's a common strategy to avoid mines early on. So I'll choose to uncover (2,2).\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,2)","uncover (2,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 9x9 grid, but looking at the Current Board section, there are 13 rows listed. Wait, maybe that's a typo? Oh, right, Minesweeper is 9x9, so probably a formatting error. Let's focus on the given info.\n\nThe first row shown is \"1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" which is 13 characters, but a 9x9 grid should have 9 columns. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's assume that each row is supposed to be 9 cells. Let's correct that. So the first row is \"1 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\" (9 cells), the second row \"? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\", third row \"? ? 3 ? ? ? ? ? ?\", and the rest are similar.\n\nThe input commands are to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags divided by 10.\n\nLooking at the current board, the first row has a '1' at (0,0). The third row has a '3' at (2,2). Let's recall that a number indicates the number of adjacent mines. So the cell (0,0) has 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So those three cells have exactly 1 mine.\n\nThe cell (2,2) has a '3', so its 8 adjacent cells have 3 mines. The adjacent cells here are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). So among these 8 cells, 3 are mines.\n\nBut since we don't have more revealed cells, it's hard to deduce mines. The safest move is to uncover a cell that's not adjacent to any revealed numbers, as those are more likely to be safe. For example, the top-left cell (0,0) is revealed as 1, so adjacent cells might have a mine, but other cells far from revealed numbers are probably safe. Let's pick a cell that's not adjacent to (0,0) or (2,2). Let's say (3,4). That's in the fourth row (index 3) and fifth column (index 4). It's not adjacent to (0,0) (which is (0,0), adjacent cells are up to row 1, column 1) and (2,2) adjacent cells are rows 1-3, columns 1-3. So (3,4) is outside of those ranges. Uncovering (3,4) is a good first move to reveal more information without high risk.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","uncover (3,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what to do next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided a 13-row board, but wait, the problem says it's a 9x9 grid. Maybe that's a formatting error, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nLooking at the current board, each row has cells that are either numbers, '?', or 'F' (but there are no Fs yet since Flags are 0\/10). The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags over 10, so we need to identify mines.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. The '?' cells are unknown; they could be mines or safe. The strategy is to find cells that must be mines (so we can flag them) or must be safe (so we can uncover them).\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers and their adjacent '?'s. For example, take a cell with a 0. All adjacent cells to a 0 are safe, so those can be uncovered. Let's check where the 0s are.\n\nLooking at row 0 (first row): \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" — there are 0s at (0,6) and (0,7). The adjacent cells to (0,6) (which is row 0, column 6) would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). But (0,6) is 0, so all adjacent cells have 0 mines. (0,7) is also 0, so adjacent cells (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) must be safe. Let's check row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\". Row 1 has 0s at (1,6) and (1,7). So (1,6) being 0 means adjacent cells (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) are safe. Similarly, (1,7) 0's adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLet's check row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" — 0s at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (4,3) is 0, so (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are safe.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are '?' and adjacent to numbers. For example, in row 0, column 4 is '?', and (0,5) is 1. The 1 at (0,5) has adjacent cells including (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). Since (0,6) and (1,6) are 0 (from row 0 and row 1), they can't be mines. So the 1 at (0,5) must have exactly one mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). (0,6) is 0, so not a mine. (1,6) is 0, so not a mine. (0,5) itself is the cell, so adjacent are the 8 around it. Let me list the 8 neighbors of (0,5):\n\n(0,5) is row 0, column 5. Its neighbors are:\n\nrow-1, col-1: ( -1,4) invalid\n\nrow-1, col: ( -1,5) invalid\n\nrow-1, col+1: (-1,6) invalid\n\nrow, col-1: (0,4) ?\n\nrow, col+1: (0,6) 0\n\nrow+1, col-1: (1,4) ?\n\nrow+1, col: (1,5) 1\n\nrow+1, col+1: (1,6) 0\n\nSo the neighbors are (0,4), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). But (1,6) is 0 (safe), (0,6) is 0 (safe). (1,5) is 1 (a number, so safe, since numbers are uncovered safe cells). So the 1 at (0,5) indicates there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The possible cells are (0,4) and (1,4). Because (1,5) is a number (uncovered, safe), so it's not a mine. So (0,5) has 1 mine in (0,4) or (1,4).\n\nNow, looking at row 1, column 4 is 2. Let's check (1,4) which is 2. Its neighbors are:\n\nrow 0, col 3: ?\n\nrow 0, col 4: ?\n\nrow 0, col 5: 1\n\nrow 1, col 3: ?\n\nrow 1, col 5: 1\n\nrow 2, col 3: ?\n\nrow 2, col 4: 1\n\nrow 2, col 5: 0\n\nSo the 2 at (1,4) must have 2 mines in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,5) is 1 (safe), (1,5) is 1 (safe), (2,5) is 0 (safe). So the possible mines are in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nThe 1 at (0,5) says there's 1 mine in (0,4) and (1,4)'s adjacent. Wait, (1,4) is the cell with 2. Let's see (2,4) is 1. The cell (2,4) is 1. Its neighbors:\n\nrow 1, col 3: ?\n\nrow 1, col 4: 2\n\nrow 1, col 5: 1\n\nrow 2, col 3: ?\n\nrow 2, col 5: 0\n\nrow 3, col 3: 1\n\nrow 3, col 4: 1\n\nrow 3, col 5: 0\n\nSo (2,4) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,4) is 2 (safe), (1,5) is 1 (safe), (2,5) is 0 (safe), (3,3) is 1 (safe), (3,4) is 1 (safe), (3,5) is 0 (safe). So the possible mines are (1,3) and (2,3). So (2,4) has 1 mine in (1,3) or (2,3).\n\nLet's look at row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\". (3,5) is 0. So its adjacent cells (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are safe. (2,4) is 1 (safe), (2,5) is 0 (safe), (2,6) is 0 (safe), (3,4) is 1 (safe), (3,6) is 0 (safe), (4,4) is 0 (safe), (4,5) is 0 (safe), (4,6) is 0 (safe). So that's consistent.\n\nLooking at row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\". (2,2) is 3. Let's check its neighbors. (2,2) is row 2, column 2. Neighbors are:\n\nrow 1, col 1: ?\n\nrow 1, col 2: ?\n\nrow 1, col 3: ?\n\nrow 2, col 1: ?\n\nrow 2, col 3: ?\n\nrow 3, col 1: ?\n\nrow 3, col 2: 2\n\nrow 3, col 3: 1\n\nSo (2,2) is 3, meaning 3 mines in those 8 cells. (3,2) is 2 (safe), (3,3) is 1 (safe). So the other 6 cells (row1,1; row1,2; row1,3; row2,1; row2,3; row3,1) must contain 3 mines.\n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any '?' adjacent to a 0 must be safe. Let's find 0 cells and their adjacent '?'.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. The cell (0,8) is 1 (safe). The cell (1,6) and (1,7) are 0. Let's check (1,7) 0: adjacent cells include (0,7) 0, (0,8) 1, (1,8) 1, (2,7) 0. (2,7) is 0 (from row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — (2,6) is 0, (2,7) is 0, (2,8) is 0). So (2,7) is 0, so adjacent cells (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8) are safe. (3,6) is 0 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" — (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0), so (3,6), (3,7), (3,8) are 0, which are safe.\n\nSo, for example, (1,8) is 1 (safe), (2,8) is 0 (safe), (3,8) is 1 (safe). So the 0s in row 1,6-7 and row 2,6-8, row 3,5-7 are all 0s, which means their adjacent cells are safe. Let's check row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\". The 0s here are from column 3 to 7. So (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. Their adjacent cells (row 3, columns 2-8; row 5, columns 2-8) should be safe. For example, (4,3)=0: adjacent cells (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (5,2)=0 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe). All safe, which matches.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\". (5,7)=1. Its adjacent cells: (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?. (5,7)=1, so there's 1 mine in those adjacent cells. The 0s (4,6), (4,7), (5,6), (6,6) are safe. (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine is (6,8). But (5,8)=2. Let's check (5,8)=2. Its adjacent cells: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1. (4,7)=0 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe). So (5,8)=2 has 2 mines in (4,9), (5,9), (6,8), (6,9). (6,9)=1 (safe), so maybe (4,9), (5,9), (6,8). But (5,7)=1 suggests 1 mine in (6,8), so (6,8) is a mine? Maybe, but not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a '?' that is definitely safe. For example, row 0, column 8 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. (0,7)=0 and (1,7)=0 are safe. (1,8)=1 and (1,9)=1 are safe. So (0,8)=1 has 1 mine in (0,9). Because the adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9). (0,7) and (1,7) are 0 (safe), (1,8) and (1,9) are 1 (safe). So (0,8)=1's mine must be in (0,9). Therefore, (0,9) is a mine. Wait, that's a possible mine. Let's verify:\n\n(0,8) is 1. Its 8 neighbors are:\n\n(0-1,8-1) = (-1,7) invalid\n\n(0-1,8) = (-1,8) invalid\n\n(0-1,8+1) = (-1,9) invalid\n\n(0,8-1) = (0,7) 0 (safe)\n\n(0,8+1) = (0,9) ?\n\n(0+1,8-1) = (1,7) 0 (safe)\n\n(0+1,8) = (1,8) 1 (safe)\n\n(0+1,8+1) = (1,9) 1 (safe)\n\nSo the only possible neighbor that's a '?' is (0,9). Since (0,8) is 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its neighbors. The only possible cell is (0,9), so (0,9) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (0,9).\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. (1,9) is 1. Let's look at (1,9)=1. Its neighbors:\n\n(0,8)=1, (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?\n\n(1,8)=1, (1,10)=2,\n\n(2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1.\n\nSo (1,9)=1's neighbors are (0,8), (0,9), (0,10), (1,8), (1,10), (2,8), (2,9), (2,10). (0,8)=1 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe), (2,8)=0 (safe), (2,9)=0 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe). So the possible mines are (0,9) and (0,10), (1,10). Since (1,9)=1, there's 1 mine among these. If (0,9) is a mine (from (0,8)=1's 1 mine), then (1,9)=1's mine is (0,9), so (0,10) and (1,10) are safe. That could work.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 2, column 8 is 0. (2,8)=0. Its neighbors are (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. All are safe, which matches 0.\n\nAnother area: row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". (6,8) is '?'. Let's check (6,7)=1. (6,7)=1's neighbors: (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. (5,6)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,6)=0 are safe. (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1 are safe. So (6,7)=1 has 1 mine in (6,8). So (6,8) is a mine? Then (5,8)=2 has 2 mines. (5,8)=2's neighbors: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1. If (6,8) is a mine, then (5,8)=2 needs one more mine. Maybe (4,9) or (5,9) or (6,9). (6,9)=1 (safe), so (4,9) or (5,9). (5,9)=2's neighbors: (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. (5,9)=2 has 2 mines. If (6,8) is a mine, then (5,9) needs one more mine, perhaps (4,9). But this is getting complicated.\n\nBack to the initial thought: (0,9) is a mine. Because (0,8)=1 has only (0,9) as a possible mine in its neighbors. Let's confirm: (0,8) is 1, neighbors are (0,7)=0 (safe), (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe), (1,9)=1 (safe). The other neighbors (top, top-left, top-right) are out of bounds. So the only possible mine is (0,9). Therefore, (0,9) must be a mine, so we should flag it. But wait, the current Flags are 0\/10, so flagging (0,9) would be a possible action.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. For example, cells adjacent to 0s that are still '?'. Let's look for 0 cells and their adjacent '?'.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3-7 are 0s. The cell (4,8) is 1. The cell (4,9) is '?'. Let's check (4,8)=1. Its neighbors: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. (3,7)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,7)=1 are safe. (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2 are safe. So (4,8)=1 has 1 mine in (4,9). So (4,9) is a mine? Then (4,9) should be flagged. But (5,9)=2's neighbors include (4,9), so if (4,9) is a mine, then (5,9) has one mine there, and needs another.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 3, column 8 is 1. (3,8)=1's neighbors: (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?. (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (4,7)=0 are safe. (3,9)=1, (4,8)=1 are safe. So (3,8)=1 has 1 mine in (4,9). So (4,9) is a mine. That's consistent with (4,8)=1. So (4,9) is a mine. So we should flag (4,9).\n\nWait, (3,8)=1's neighbors: (2,7)=0 (row 2, column 7 is 0), (2,8)=0 (row 2, column 8 is 0), (2,9)=0 (row 2, column 9 is 0), (3,7)=0 (row 3, column 7 is 0), (3,9)=1 (row 3, column 9 is 1), (4,7)=0 (row 4, column 7 is 0), (4,8)=1 (row 4, column 8 is 1), (4,9)=? (row 4, column 9 is ?). So all neighbors except (4,9) are safe (0 or 1, which are uncovered). So (3,8)=1 must have exactly 1 mine, which is (4,9). Therefore, (4,9) is a mine. So flag (4,9).\n\nAnother check: row 4, column 8 is 1. Its neighbors are (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. All except (4,9) are safe. So 1 mine in (4,9). Correct. So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nSimilarly, let's check row 5, column 8 is 2. (5,8)=2's neighbors: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1. We know (4,9) is a mine (from above), so that's 1 mine. Then (5,8)=2 needs another mine. Let's see (6,8)=? is another possible mine. Let's check (6,7)=1. (6,7)=1's neighbors: (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. (5,6)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,6)=0 are safe. (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1 are safe. So (6,7)=1 has 1 mine in (6,8). So (6,8) is a mine. Then (5,8)=2 has (4,9) and (6,8) as mines, which totals 2. That fits. So (6,8) is a mine.\n\nSo (4,9) and (6,8) are mines. Let's confirm (6,8) is a mine. (6,7)=1 has (6,8) as the only possible mine, so yes.\n\nNow, (6,9)=1. Its neighbors: (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,10)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (7,10)=0. (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,10)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (7,10)=0 are safe. (6,8)=? is a mine (as per above). So (6,9)=1 has 1 mine in (6,8), which matches. Good.\n\nNow, (5,9)=2. Its neighbors: (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. We know (4,9) and (6,8) are mines (2 mines), so (5,9)=2 is correct. Perfect.\n\nLet's check (7,7)=1. (7,7)=1's neighbors: (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=0, (7,8)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=?, (8,8)=1. (6,6)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,6)=0 are safe. (6,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (8,8)=1 are safe. So (7,7)=1 has 1 mine in (6,8) or (8,7). We already know (6,8) is a mine, so (8,7) is safe. Therefore, (8,7) can be uncovered.\n\n(8,7) is in row 8, column 7. The current board for row 8 is \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So (8,7) is 0 (since row 8, column 7 is 0). Wait, row 8: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — columns 0-2 are 0,0,1; column 3 is '?'; column 4 is 1; columns 5-12 are 0. So (8,7) is 0 (safe). So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's look for a safe cell to uncover. For example, any '?' that is adjacent to a 0 and must be safe. Let's check row 0, column 2: '?'. What's around it? (0,2) is '?'. Its neighbors include (0,1)=?, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 7: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". (7,3) is '?'. Let's check (7,2)=1. (7,2)=1's neighbors: (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=?, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=?. (6,1)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,1)=0 are safe. (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (8,2)=1 are safe. So (7,2)=1 has 1 mine in (7,3) or (8,3). (7,4)=1. (7,4)=1's neighbors: (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (7,3)=?, (7,5)=0, (8,3)=?, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0. (6,5)=0, (7,5)=0, (8,5)=0 are safe. (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (8,4)=1 are safe. So (7,4)=1 has 1 mine in (7,3) or (8,3). So (7,2)=1 and (7,4)=1 both have 1 mine in (7,3) and (8,3). That means either (7,3) is a mine and (8,3) is safe, or (8,3) is a mine and (7,3) is safe. But we can't determine which yet.\n\nAnother area: row 9: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (9,3) is '?'. Row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (10,3) is '?'. Row 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (11,3) is 1. (11,3)=1's neighbors: (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?, (10,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,4)=1, (12,2)=0, (12,3)=0, (12,4)=0. (12,2)=0, (12,3)=0, (12,4)=0 are safe. (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,4)=1 are safe. So (11,3)=1 has 1 mine in (10,3). So (10,3) is a mine. Then (10,3) is a mine. Then row 10, column 3 is a mine. So we should flag (10,3).\n\nSimilarly, row 9, column 3: (9,3) is '?'. (9,2)=1. (9,2)=1's neighbors: (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=?, (9,1)=0, (9,3)=?, (10,1)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=? (which we think is a mine). (8,1)=0, (9,1)=0, (10,1)=0 are safe. (8,2)=1, (10,2)=1 are safe. So (9,2)=1 has 1 mine in (8,3), (9,3), (10,3). We know (10,3) is a mine, so (8,3) and (9,3) are safe. Therefore, (8,3) and (9,3) can be uncovered.\n\nLet's confirm (10,3) is a mine. (11,3)=1's neighbors: (10,3) is the only '?', so yes. So (10,3) is a mine. Flag that.\n\nNow, row 8, column 3: (8,3) is '?'. From above, (9,2)=1's mine is (10,3), so (8,3) and (9,3) are safe. So (8,3) can be uncovered. Let's check (8,3)'s neighbors. (8,3) is in row 8, column 3. Its neighbors are (7,2)=1, (7,3)=?, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=?, (9,4)=1. (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,4)=1 are safe. (7,3)=? and (9,3)=? are unknown, but we know (9,3) is safe (from earlier), so (8,3) is safe. So uncovering (8,3) is safe.\n\nSimilarly, row 9, column 3: (9,3) is '?', and we determined it's safe, so uncovering (9,3) is safe.\n\nLet's pick one of these safe cells to uncover. Let's choose (8,3). The current board for row 8 is \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — column 3 is '?', so (8,3) is the cell. Uncovering it should be safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,3)","uncover (8,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The board is 9x9, but the input shows 13 rows, maybe a typo? Wait, no, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check again. Oh, maybe it's a 13x9 grid? The problem statement says 9x9, so perhaps the current board is presented with line breaks that split the rows. Let me parse the current board correctly.\n\nWait, the user's current board is listed as 13 lines, each line probably representing a row of the 9x9 grid. But 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let me count: the first line has \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" which is 13 characters, that's not 9. Maybe it's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the current board is a larger grid, but the problem states it's 9x9. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display. Let's assume that the rows are 9x9, maybe each row is split into parts. For example, maybe the first row is \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1\" (9 cells), then the next part is \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1\" as the second row, etc. Let's try to reconstruct the 9x9 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current board is presented with each row being 13 characters, but that's conflicting with the 9x9 rule. Maybe the problem statement has a mistake, but I need to proceed. Let's focus on the game rules and the possible moves.\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag all mines. The score is correct flags over 10. The current state has some cells uncovered (numbers), some marked as '?', and some as 'F' (but the Flags count is 0\/10, so no F's yet).\n\nLooking at the current board, let's look for cells that must be safe or must be mines. For example, a cell with a number 0 means all adjacent cells are safe, so those can be uncovered. Let's find 0s.\n\nIn the first line (assuming row 0), there's \"1 0 0 1\" — maybe the third and fourth cells in row 0 are 0? If a cell is 0, all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if (0,6) is 0, then (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) are safe. Similarly, (0,7) is 0, so adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 4 (assuming row 4 is \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\"), there are 0s at (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7). A 0 at (4,3) means all adjacent cells (row 3, cols 2-4; row 4, cols 2-4; row 5, cols 2-4) are safe. So any '?' in those areas can be uncovered safely.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\" — 0s here mean adjacent cells are safe. For example, (5,0) is 0, so (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1) are safe.\n\nLooking for cells that are '?' and adjacent to 0s. For example, if a 0 is at (row, col), then all 8 surrounding cells are safe, so any '?' in those positions can be uncovered without hitting a mine.\n\nLet's look for 0s and their adjacent '?'. For example, row 0 has \"1 0 0 1\" — let's say (0,6) is 0. Then adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). If any of these are '?', they can be uncovered. Let's check the second row: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1\" — (1,6) and (1,7) are 0. So (1,6) is 0, so adjacent cells (0,5-7), (1,5-7), (2,5-7) are safe. For example, (0,5) is 1, (0,6) is 0, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. Then (2,5) is 0 (from row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\") — (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 0, (2,7) is 0. So 0s in row 2, cols 5-7. Then (2,5) is 0, so (1,4-6), (2,4-6), (3,4-6) are safe. (3,4) is 1 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\"). (3,5) is 0, (3,6) is 0, (3,7) is 0. So (3,5) is 0, so (2,4-6), (3,4-6), (4,4-6) are safe. (4,5) is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\"), so (3,4-6), (4,4-6), (5,4-6) are safe. (5,5) is 0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\"), so (4,4-6), (5,4-6), (6,4-6) are safe.\n\nSo, all these 0s create a large safe area. Any '?' in these adjacent areas can be safely uncovered. Let's look for '?' in those regions.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1\" — cols 1-4 are '?'. Maybe those are not adjacent to 0s. Row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1\" — cols 0-3 are '?'. Row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\" — cols 0-1, 3 are '?'. Row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\" — cols 0-1 are '?'. Row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" — maybe col 8 is '?'. Row 7: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — col 3 is '?'. Row 9: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — col 3 is '?'. Row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — col 3 is '?'.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is actually 13 rows, but that's conflicting with the 9x9 rule. Maybe the user made a mistake, but I need to proceed. Let's focus on the cells that are 0 and their adjacent cells. For example, if a cell is 0, all 8 surrounding are safe. So any '?' next to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's find such cells.\n\nSuppose in row 4, there's a 0 at (4,3). Then (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are safe. If any of these are '?', they can be uncovered. Let's check row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\". So (3,2) is 2, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1 — those are uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\". (5,0) is 0, so (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1) are safe. (4,0) is 1, (4,1) is 1, (5,1) is 0, (6,0) is 0, (6,1) is 0 — all uncovered.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". Let's assume (6,8) is '?'. What's adjacent to (6,8)? Let's see, (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). If (6,7) is 1, (6,9) is 1, (7,7) is 1, (7,8) is 1, (7,9) is 1. So (6,8) is adjacent to 1s, but maybe not a 0.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". (7,3) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2) is 1, (6,3) is 1, (6,4) is 1, (7,2) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (8,2) is 1, (8,3) is 1, (8,4) is 1. So (7,3) is surrounded by 1s. The cell (7,2) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (7,2) are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1) is 0, (6,2) is 1, (6,3) is 1, (7,1) is 0, (7,3) is '?', (8,1) is 0, (8,2) is 1, (8,3) is 1. So (7,2)=1 has 1 mine in those 8 cells. Currently, (6,2)=1 (but 1 is a number, not a mine), (6,3)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1 are numbers. So the mine must be in (7,3) or the others. But (6,1)=0, (7,1)=0, (8,1)=0 are safe. So (7,2)=1 has 1 mine in (6,2), (6,3), (7,3), (8,2), (8,3). But those are all numbers except (7,3). So if (7,3) is a mine, then (7,2)=1 would have 1 mine (correct). But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. The best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, as those are guaranteed safe. Let's find such a cell.\n\nLooking at row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\". The 0s are at (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). So (2,5)=0, so adjacent cells (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are safe. (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0 — all uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\". The 0s are at (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). So (3,5)=0, adjacent cells (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are safe. (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\". 0s at (4,3) to (4,7). Adjacent cells (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are safe. (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\". 0s here, adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". (6,5)=0, so adjacent cells (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), (7,6) are safe. (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". (7,5)=0, adjacent cells (6,4), (6,5), (6,6), (7,4), (7,6), (8,4), (8,5), (8,6) are safe. (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". 0s here, adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (9,3) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4). (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,4)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,3)='?', (10,4)=1. So (9,3) is surrounded by 1s. Not sure.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (10,3) is '?'. Adjacent cells similar to row 9.\n\nRow 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". All uncovered.\n\nRow 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". All uncovered.\n\nSo, maybe the '?' cells are in the top-left area. Let's look at row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1\". So (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are '?'. Row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1\" — (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are '?'. Row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\" — (2,0), (2,1), (2,3) are '?'. Row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\" — (3,0), (3,1) are '?'.\n\nLet's check the cell (3,1). What's adjacent to (3,1)? Let's see, (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,2)=3, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. So (3,1) is adjacent to (2,2)=3, which is a number indicating 3 mines around it. Let's look at (2,2)=3. Its adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2)=3 means 3 mines in those 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(1,1)='?', (1,2)='?', (1,3)='?', (2,1)='?', (2,3)='?', (3,1)='?', (3,2)=2 (number), (3,3)=1 (number). So (3,2) and (3,3) are safe (numbers), so the 3 mines must be among the 6 '?' cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nNow, let's check (3,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2)=3, (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)=1, (4,1), (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. (3,2)=2 means 2 mines in these 8 cells. (2,2)=3 is a number (safe), (3,3)=1 is safe, (4,1)=1 is safe, (4,2)=1 is safe, (4,3)=0 is safe. So the mines are in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). So 3 cells, and (3,2)=2 requires 2 mines here. So 2 of these 3 are mines.\n\nAlso, (2,3) is '?'. Let's check (2,3)'s adjacent cells. (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)=2, (2,2)=3, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. (2,3) is adjacent to (1,4)=2, which has 2 mines around it. (1,4)=2's adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)=1, (1,3), (1,5)=1, (2,3), (2,4)=1, (3,4)=1. (0,5)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,4)=1, (3,4)=1 are numbers (safe). So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3).\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, earlier I saw row 0 has \"1 0 0 1\" — perhaps (0,6)=0 and (0,7)=0. So (0,6)=0 means all adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0 — all uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nAnother 0 is (1,6)=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nHow about (2,5)=0? Adjacent cells (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\n(3,5)=0's adjacent cells are (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\n(4,5)=0's adjacent cells: (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0 — all uncovered.\n\nSo all 0s have their adjacent cells already uncovered. Then the remaining '?' cells are not adjacent to 0s, so we need to look for other clues.\n\nLet's look at a cell with a number and see if we can deduce mines. For example, (0,0)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). So (0,0)=1 means exactly 1 mine among these three '?' cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).\n\n(1,0) is '?', adjacent to (0,0)=1, (0,1)='?', (1,1)='?', (2,0)='?', (2,1)='?'.\n\n(2,0) is '?', adjacent to (1,0)='?', (1,1)='?', (2,1)='?', (3,0)='?'.\n\nThis is too vague. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is in a region with the most 0-adjacent cells, but since all 0-adjacent are uncovered, perhaps uncover a cell that's in a low-number area.\n\nAlternatively, look for a cell that's surrounded by 1s. For example, row 7, col 3 is '?'. Let's say (7,3) is the cell. Its adjacent cells are (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. So 8 cells, all 1s. A 1 means 1 mine in adjacent cells. Let's take (7,2)=1. Its adjacent cells are (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)='?', (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. The 0s (6,1), (7,1), (8,1) are safe. The 1s (6,2), (6,3), (8,2), (8,3) are numbers (safe). So the only possible mine is (7,3). So (7,2)=1 has 1 mine, which must be (7,3). Therefore, (7,3) is a mine! So we should flag it. But wait, the current Flags are 0\/10, so if we flag (7,3), and it's a mine, that's a correct flag. But how sure are we?\n\nLet's verify. (7,2)=1: adjacent cells are 8. Of those, 3 are 0s (safe), 4 are 1s (numbers, so safe), and 1 is '?'. So the mine must be in the '?'. Therefore, (7,3) is a mine. So we should flag (7,3).\n\nBut wait, let's check another cell. (6,3)=1. Its adjacent cells: (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,3)='?', (7,4)=1. The 0s (5,2), (5,3), (5,4) are safe. The 1s (6,2), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4) are numbers (safe). So the only possible mine is (7,3). So (6,3)=1 also has 1 mine, which is (7,3). So this confirms that (7,3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (7,3).\n\nBut wait, the user's current Flags are 0\/10, so flagging (7,3) would increase correct flags if it's a mine. But let's check if there are other cells that are definitely mines.\n\nAnother example: row 9, col 3 is '?'. Let's say (9,3). Adjacent cells are (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,4)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,3)='?', (10,4)=1. (8,2)=1's adjacent cells: (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=mine (if we're right), (8,1)=0, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)='?'. The 0s (7,1), (8,1), (9,1) are safe. (7,2)=1, (7,3)=mine, (8,3)=1, (9,2)=1 are safe (numbers) except (7,3)=mine. So (8,2)=1 has 1 mine (7,3), so the other cells (8,2) adjacent are safe. So (9,3) is not a mine for (8,2)=1.\n\nAlternatively, let's go back to (7,3). Since (7,2)=1 and (6,3)=1 both require (7,3) to be a mine, that's a strong indication. So the best move is to flag (7,3). But wait, the problem says the game ends if you uncover a mine. But flagging is safe. However, the user's current action could be to flag a mine. But let's confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recheck (7,2)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(6,1) = 0 (safe)\n\n(6,2) = 1 (number, safe)\n\n(6,3) = 1 (number, safe)\n\n(7,1) = 0 (safe)\n\n(7,3) = ? (unknown)\n\n(8,1) = 0 (safe)\n\n(8,2) = 1 (number, safe)\n\n(8,3) = 1 (number, safe)\n\nSo among these 8 cells, the only unknown is (7,3). Since (7,2)=1, there must be exactly 1 mine in these 8. All others are safe, so (7,3) must be the mine. Therefore, (7,3) is a mine. So we should flag it.\n\nBut wait, the user's current board shows row 7 as \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — so (7,3) is '?'. So the correct action is to flag (7,3).\n\n\n\nAnswer: flag (7,3)","flag (7,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the rules. \n\nThe board is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the current board provided, it seems like maybe the rows are listed as 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error. Wait, the user probably pasted the board as rows, each row being a line. Let me check the input. The Current Board shows 13 lines, each with a sequence of characters. But the game is supposed to be 9x9. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps each line is a row, and maybe the user made a mistake. But regardless, I need to focus on the visible cells and figure out safe moves.\n\nFirst, let's list out the known information. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is correct flags \/ 10, and right now the score is 0.1, which means 1 correct flag (since 1\/10 = 0.1). The flags count is 1\/10, so there's 1 flag placed, which is correct. The unflags are 0, so no flags have been removed.\n\nLooking at the Current Board, let's parse each row. Let's index rows from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows) and columns from 0 to 12 (since some rows have up to 13 characters). Wait, but the original game is 9x9, so maybe the board is displayed with some rows split? Maybe it's a formatting issue. Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the board layout. But regardless, let's look for the 'F' which indicates a flagged cell. \n\nIn the Current Board, row 7 (0-based) has \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". So that's row 7, column 3 (since the 4th character is F). So (7,3) is flagged, and that's the correct flag (since the score is 0.1, which is 1 correct flag).\n\nNow, the task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Let's look for cells that are safe to uncover (i.e., cells that are '?' and can be determined to be safe based on the numbers around them).\n\nLet's take some example cells. Let's look at row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" So row 0, column 0 is '1'. The adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) would be the cells around (0,0). But (0,0) is a '1', which means there's 1 mine in the 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) would be (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). Since (0,0) is a '1', those three cells have exactly 1 mine.\n\nBut maybe looking at cells with 0s. For example, in row 0, columns 6 and 7 are '0' (row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\"). A '0' means none of the adjacent cells have mines. So any '?' adjacent to a '0' can be safely uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 6 is '0'. Its adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 0, column 6 (0,6) is '0'. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)\n\nBut (0,5) is '1' (row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" so column 5 is '1'), (0,7) is '0', (1,5) is '2' (row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so column 5 is '1'), (1,6) is '0', (1,7) is '0'. So (0,6) is 0, so all adjacent cells (which are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)) have no mines. But (0,5) is '1' which is a number, so that's already uncovered. (0,7) is '0', uncovered. (1,5) is '1', (1,6) is '0', (1,7) is '0'—all uncovered. So maybe that 0 doesn't help with new cells.\n\nLooking at row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\". Column 3-7 are 0s. Let's take (4,3) which is 0. Adjacent cells would be (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (4,3) is 0, so none of those cells have mines. Let's check those cells:\n\n(3,2) is '2' (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so column 2 is '2'), (3,3) is '1', (3,4) is '1'—all uncovered. (4,2) is '1', (4,4) is '0'—uncovered. (5,2) is '0' (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" column 2 is 0), (5,3) is '0', (5,4) is '0'—all uncovered. So again, no new cells here.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\". Column 7 is '1'. Let's take (5,7) which is '1'. Adjacent cells would be (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (5,7) is '1', so exactly 1 mine in those 8 cells. Let's check which are uncovered:\n\n(4,6) is '0' (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\" column 6 is 0), (4,7) is '0', (4,8) is '1' (row 4, column 8 is '1'), (5,6) is '0' (row 5, column 6 is 0), (5,8) is '2' (row 5, column 8 is '2'), (6,6) is '0' (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\" column 6 is 0), (6,7) is '1' (row 6, column 7 is '1'), (6,8) is '?' (row 6, column 8 is '?'). So the adjacent cells to (5,7) that are '?' is (6,8). The others are numbers or 0. So (5,7) is '1', which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (6,8). So (6,8) must be a mine? Wait, but (4,8) is '1' (row 4, column 8). Let's check (4,8): it's '1', so adjacent cells to (4,8) are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (4,8) is '1', so 1 mine in those. (3,7) is '0' (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" column 7 is 0), (3,8) is '1' (row 3, column 8 is 1), (3,9) is '1' (row 3, column 9 is 1), (4,7) is 0, (4,9) is '?' (row 4, column 9 is '?'), (5,7) is '1', (5,8) is '2', (5,9) is '2' (row 5, column 9 is '2'). So (4,8) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The unknowns here are (4,9). So (4,9) might be a mine? But (5,8) is '2' (row 5, column 8). Let's check (5,8): it's '2', so adjacent cells have 2 mines. (5,8) adjacent cells are (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). (4,7) is 0, (4,8) is 1, (4,9) is '?', (5,7) is 1, (5,9) is '2', (6,7) is 1 (row 6, column 7 is 1), (6,8) is '?', (6,9) is '1' (row 6, column 9 is 1). So (5,8) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The unknowns here are (4,9) and (6,8). If (5,7) is '1' and (5,7) adjacent cells include (6,8) as the only unknown, then (6,8) must be a mine (since 1 mine needed). Then (5,8) has 2 mines: if (6,8) is a mine, then maybe (4,9) is another mine. But (4,8) is '1' which has (4,9) as adjacent. If (4,9) is a mine, then (4,8) would have 1 mine (correct). Then (5,8) would have (4,9) and (6,8) as mines, totaling 2, which matches the '2'. That seems possible. So (6,8) and (4,9) could be mines. But we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Column 2 is '1' (row 8, column 2). Adjacent cells are (7,1), (7,2), (7,3), (8,1), (8,3), (9,1), (9,2), (9,3). (8,2) is '1', so 1 mine in those cells. (7,1) is 0 (row7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" column1 is 0), (7,2) is 1 (row7, column2 is 1), (7,3) is F (flagged), (8,1) is 0, (8,3) is 1, (9,1) is 0 (row9: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" column1 is 0), (9,2) is 1 (row9, column2 is 1), (9,3) is '?' (row9, column3 is '?'). So the adjacent cells to (8,2) are (7,3) which is F (mine), and (9,3) which is '?'. Since (8,2) is '1', and (7,3) is a mine (flagged correctly), that accounts for the 1 mine. So (9,3) must be safe. Because (8,2) has 1 mine in adjacent cells, and (7,3) is that mine, so (9,3) can't be a mine. Therefore, (9,3) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nLet's verify that. (8,2) is '1', adjacent cells:\n\n- (7,1): 0 (safe)\n- (7,2): 1 (safe, number)\n- (7,3): F (mine, correct)\n- (8,1): 0 (safe)\n- (8,3): 1 (safe, number)\n- (9,1): 0 (safe)\n- (9,2): 1 (safe, number)\n- (9,3): ? (unknown)\n\nSince (7,3) is a mine (flagged), that's the 1 mine required for (8,2). So (9,3) can't be a mine. Therefore, (9,3) is safe. So the action should be to uncover (9,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,3)","uncover (9,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The board is 9x9, but looking at the input, the rows listed here are 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error, but maybe it's a typo. Let's focus on the given data.\n\nThe user provided the current board, which is a grid of characters. Let's parse the rows. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list them row by row, assuming each row is a separate line. Let's index the rows from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows listed), but Minesweeper is supposed to be 9x9. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps the actual game is larger? Or maybe it's a typo. Let's proceed.\n\nThe current board rows are:\n\nRow 0: 1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines. The score is correct flags \/ 10, and currently, Flags: 1\/10, so one mine is correctly flagged (the F in row 7, column 3). We need to either flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells to win. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. In Minesweeper, a cell with a number indicates the count of mines in adjacent cells. If a cell is uncovered (number or 0) and the number of adjacent flags equals the number, then the remaining adjacent ? can be uncovered. Also, if the number of adjacent ? plus flags equals the number, then the ? must be mines.\n\nLet's look at row 7, column 3: that's an F (flagged). Let's check adjacent cells to see if that flag is correct. The cell at row 7, column 2 is 1. The adjacent cells to (7,2) are: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). The current cell (7,2) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(6,1): 0 (row 6, column 1 is 0)\n(6,2): 1 (row 6, column 2 is 1)\n(6,3): 1 (row 6, column 3 is 1)\n(7,1): 0 (row 7, column 1 is 0)\n(7,3): F (flagged)\n(8,1): 0 (row 8, column 1 is 0)\n(8,2): 1 (row 8, column 2 is 1)\n(8,3): 1 (row 8, column 3 is 1)\n\nWait, (7,2) is 1, so the sum of mines in adjacent cells should be 1. The F is at (7,3), which is adjacent. If that F is a mine, then the other adjacent cells (all the 1s and 0s) must be safe. Since 0s are already uncovered and safe, and the 1s are numbers, that F is a correct flag. So that's one correct mine.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with 0. Uncovering a 0 cell reveals all adjacent cells automatically. Let's check where the 0s are. For example, row 0 has \"1 0 0 1\" at columns 6,7,8. So row 0, columns 6 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 8 is 1. A 0 cell means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So any ? adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6 (0). Adjacent cells would be (0-1,6-1) to (0+1,6+1), but row 0 is the top, so rows 0 and 1, columns 5-7. The cell (0,6) is 0. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,5): 1 (already uncovered)\n(0,7): 0 (uncovered)\n(1,5): 1 (row 1, column 5 is 1)\n(1,6): 0 (row 1, column 6 is 0)\n(1,7): 0 (row 1, column 7 is 0)\n(0,5) is 1, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. So (0,6) being 0 is correct, and adjacent cells are already uncovered except maybe others.\n\nAnother 0 is row 0, column 7 (0). Its adjacent cells are (0,6) (0), (0,8) (1), (1,6) (0), (1,7) (0), (1,8) (1). All these are uncovered, so nothing new here.\n\nRow 1 has \"0 0 1 1 2\" at columns 6,7,8,9,10. So row 1, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0. Let's check row 1, column 6 (0). Adjacent cells are (0,5) (1), (0,6) (0), (0,7) (0), (1,5) (1), (1,7) (0), (2,5) (1), (2,6) (0), (2,7) (0). All these are uncovered, so no ? there.\n\nRow 2 has \"0 0 0 0 0 1\" at columns 5-10. So row 2, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 8 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 10 is 1. Let's take row 2, column 5 (0). Adjacent cells: (1,4) (2), (1,5) (1), (1,6) (0), (2,4) (1), (2,6) (0), (3,4) (1), (3,5) (0), (3,6) (0). All these are uncovered. So 0s here don't have adjacent ?.\n\nRow 3 has \"0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" at columns 5-12. So row 3, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells to row 3, column 5 (0) are (2,4) (1), (2,5) (0), (2,6) (0), (3,4) (1), (3,6) (0), (4,4) (0), (4,5) (0), (4,6) (0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 4 has \"0 0 0 0 0 0 1\" at columns 3-9. So row 4, column 3 is 0, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 8 is 1. Adjacent to row 4, column 8 (1) is row 4, column 8. Let's check that 1. Its adjacent cells: (3,7) (0), (3,8) (1), (3,9) (1), (4,7) (0), (4,9) (?), (5,7) (1), (5,8) (2), (5,9) (2). The cell (4,8) is 1, so there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells that are ? is (4,9). So if (4,8) is 1, then (4,9) could be a mine? Or maybe not. Let's see: (4,9) is ?, adjacent to (4,8)=1. Let's check other cells around (4,9). (4,9) is in row 4, column 9. Adjacent cells are (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1. So (4,9) is adjacent to several numbers. Let's check (5,8)=2. (5,8) is 2, so adjacent mines: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1. So (5,8)=2: the sum of mines in these 8 cells should be 2. The known numbers: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,9)=2 (number), (6,7)=1 (safe), (6,9)=1 (safe). So the ? cells are (4,9) and (6,8). So 2 mines in those two cells. Then (5,9)=2: (5,9) is 2. Its adjacent cells: (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=?, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. So (5,9)=2 needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. The ? cells here are (4,9) and (6,8). So if (5,8)=2 and (5,9)=2, both require 2 mines in (4,9) and (6,8). That's possible. So (4,9) and (6,8) are either both mines or one is a mine. Not sure yet.\n\nLet's look at row 6, column 8: it's a ?. Adjacent cells: (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,9)=1, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1. (6,8) is ?, (6,7)=1 (row 6, column 7 is 1). (6,7) is 1: adjacent cells are (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=?, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. So (6,7)=1: there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The ? here is (6,8). So if (6,7)=1, then (6,8) must be a mine. Because the other adjacent cells are 0s, 1s (numbers, so safe), so the only unknown is (6,8). So (6,7)=1 implies (6,8) is a mine. Therefore, (6,8) should be flagged.\n\nWait, let's confirm. (6,7) is 1. Let's list all adjacent cells to (6,7):\n\n- (5,6): 0 (row 5, column 6: 0) → safe\n- (5,7): 1 (row 5, column 7: 1) → number, safe\n- (5,8): 2 (row 5, column 8: 2) → number, safe\n- (6,6): 0 (row 6, column 6: 0) → safe\n- (6,8): ? (row 6, column 8: ?) → unknown\n- (7,6): 0 (row 7, column 6: 0) → safe\n- (7,7): 1 (row 7, column 7: 1) → number, safe\n- (7,8): 1 (row 7, column 8: 1) → number, safe\n\nSo the only unknown adjacent cell to (6,7) is (6,8). Since (6,7) is 1, that means exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are safe (0 or numbers, which are safe), so (6,8) must be the mine. Therefore, (6,8) should be flagged.\n\nSo the action here is to flag (6,8). Let's check if that's possible. The current flags are 1\/10, so adding this would make it 2\/10. Let's confirm the coordinates. The rows are 0-based, columns 0-based. Row 6, column 8. Let's check the current board: row 6 is \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". The 8th column (index 8) is the \"?\", which is (6,8). So yes, that's the cell. So the action should be 'flag (6,8)'.\n\nWait, but let's check another angle. Let's see row 6, column 7 is 1. Adjacent cells: (6,8) is the only ?, so yes, (6,8) must be a mine. So flagging (6,8) is correct.\n\n\n\nAnswer: flag (6,8)","flag (6,8)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current board state. The user has a score of 0.2, which means they correctly flagged 2 out of 10 mines (since 2\/10 = 0.2). There are 2 flags placed, and 0 unflags. \n\nThe board is a 13x13 grid? Wait, the initial description says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 13 rows and 13 columns. Maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with the current board as given. Let's look at the cells to find safe moves.\n\nFirst, let's recall that a number in a cell indicates the number of adjacent mines. The '?' are unknown, 'F' are flagged (which might be correct or incorrect). The goal is to uncover safe cells or flag mines correctly.\n\nLooking for cells with numbers that can help us deduce safe cells or mines. Let's start with cells that have 0, because those mean no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells can be safely uncovered.\n\nFor example, in row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. Let's check their adjacent cells. A 0 cell means all 8 surrounding cells are safe. Let's see row 0, column 6 (0,6) is 0. Adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 1, which is already uncovered. (0,7) is 0, which is uncovered. (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. So those are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is (0,7). Its adjacent cells would be (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6) is 0, (0,8) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0, (1,8) is 1. All those are uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 6 and 7 are 0. (1,6) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5) is 1, (0,6) 0, (0,7) 0, (1,5) 2, (1,7) 0, (2,5) 1, (2,6) 0, (2,7) 0. All these are uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 6 and 7 are 0. (2,6) is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). (1,5) 2, (1,6) 0, (1,7) 0, (2,5) 1, (2,7) 0, (3,5) 0, (3,6) 0, (3,7) 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, columns 5-7 are 0. (3,5) is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4) 1, (2,5) 1, (2,6) 0, (3,4) 1, (3,6) 0, (4,4) 0, (4,5) 0, (4,6) 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, columns 4-6 are 0. (4,4) is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5). (3,3) 1, (3,4) 1, (3,5) 0, (4,3) 0, (4,5) 0, (5,3) 0, (5,4) 0, (5,5) 0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, columns 3-5 are 0. (5,3) is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (4,2) 1, (4,3) 0, (4,4) 0, (5,2) 0, (5,4) 0, (6,2) 1, (6,3) 0 (since (6,3) is F, but wait, (6,3) is F? Let's check row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" so (6,8) is F. Row 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" so (7,3) is F. So (5,3) adjacent cells: (6,2) is 1 (row 6, column 2 is 1), (6,3) is F (row 7, column 3 is F, which is (7,3), so (5,3) is (row 5, column 3). (5,3) adjacent cells would be (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,2), (5,4), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4). (6,2) is 1 (row 6, column 2), (6,3) is (row 6, column 3) which is 1 (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" so columns 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:1,8:F,9:1, etc. So (6,3) is 1, not F. The F in row 6 is (6,8). The F in row 7 is (7,3). So (5,3) adjacent cells (6,3) is 1 (row 6, column 3), which is 1, and (6,4) is 1 (row 6, column 4). So all adjacent cells to (5,3) are uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that have some adjacent '?' which can be determined. For example, let's check row 0, column 0 is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). All of these are '?', so not helpful yet.\n\nRow 0, column 5 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,4) is '?', (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0. So (0,5) is 1, which has (0,4) as '?', (1,4) as 2. Maybe not helpful.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is 2. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,5) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is 1. The others are '?'. So 2 mines in those 8 cells, but some are already known (the 1s are safe). Maybe not.\n\nRow 2, column 2 is 3. Adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (3,2) is 2, (3,3) is 1. The rest are '?'. 3 mines here, but not sure.\n\nRow 3, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells: (2,7), (2,8), (2,9), (3,7), (3,9), (4,7), (4,8), (4,9). (2,7) is 0, (3,7) is 0, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is '?'. (3,8) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. (4,8) is '?', (2,8) is '?', (2,9) is '?', (3,9) is 1, (4,9) is 2. Maybe (4,8) is safe?\n\nRow 4, column 8 is 1. Adjacent cells: (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (3,7) is 0, (3,8) is 1, (3,9) is 1, (4,7) is 1, (4,9) is 2, (5,7) is 1, (5,8) is 2, (5,9) is 1. So (4,8) is 1, which means one mine in these adjacent cells. Some are numbers, so maybe (4,8) adjacent cells are already mostly uncovered, but (4,8) itself is 1? Wait, no: (4,8) is a cell that's uncovered and shows 1. So its adjacent cells have one mine.\n\nLooking at row 6, column 8 is F (flagged). Let's check the cell (6,8). What's the number in the adjacent cells. Let's take (5,7) which is 1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,7)=1). (5,7) is 1, so adjacent cells have 1 mine. (5,7) adjacent cells: (4,6), (4,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,6), (6,7), (6,8). (4,6) is 0, (4,7) is 1, (4,8) is 1, (5,6) is 0, (5,8) is 2, (6,6) is 0, (6,7) is 1, (6,8) is F. So (5,7) is 1, which means exactly one mine in those 8 cells. If (6,8) is a mine (flagged correctly), then that's the one mine. So (5,7) is satisfied if (6,8) is a mine. That's a possible correct flag.\n\nAnother flagged cell is (7,3) (row 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\"). Let's check (7,3) F. Let's look at adjacent cells. (6,2) is 1 (row 6, column 2), (6,3) is 1, (6,4) is 1, (7,2) is 1, (7,4) is 1, (8,2) is 1, (8,3) is 1, (8,4) is 1. Let's take (6,2) which is 1. (6,2) adjacent cells: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (6,1), (6,3), (7,1), (7,2), (7,3). (5,1) is 0, (5,2) is 0, (5,3) is 0, (6,1) is 0, (6,3) is 1, (7,1) is 0, (7,2) is 1, (7,3) is F. (6,2) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. If (7,3) is a mine, then that's the one mine, so (6,2) is satisfied. So (7,3) might be a correct flag as well. Since the score is 0.2, which is 2\/10, these two flags are correct.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. Let's check row 10, column 3: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (10,3) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (10,2) is 1. (10,2) is 1, so adjacent cells have 1 mine. (10,2) adjacent cells: (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1) is 0, (9,2) is 1, (9,3) is 1, (10,1) is 0, (10,3) is '?', (11,1) is 0, (11,2) is 1, (11,3) is 1. So (10,2) is 1, which needs one mine in those 8 cells. The known cells: (9,2)=1 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So the only unknown is (10,3) and (9,1), (10,1), (11,1) which are 0 (safe). So (9,1), (10,1), (11,1) are 0, so they are safe (no mines). Therefore, the only possible mine adjacent to (10,2) is (10,3) or none? Wait, (10,2) is 1, so exactly one mine. The adjacent cells that are safe are (9,1)=0, (10,1)=0, (11,1)=0 (so no mines there). (9,2)=1 (uncovered, so safe), (9,3)=1 (uncovered, safe), (11,2)=1 (uncovered, safe), (11,3)=1 (uncovered, safe). So the only cell left is (10,3). So (10,2) is 1, which requires one mine in its adjacent cells. The only possible cell is (10,3). So (10,3) must be a mine. Wait, but if (10,3) is a mine, then (10,2) being 1 is correct. But let's check another cell. (10,4) is 1. (10,4) adjacent cells: (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (10,3), (10,5), (11,3), (11,4), (11,5). (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0. (10,4) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. The known safe cells: (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0. So the only unknown is (10,3). So (10,4) is 1, which would require one mine. If (10,3) is a mine, then (10,4) has one mine (from (10,3)), which fits. So (10,3) is likely a mine. But we can't flag it yet unless we're sure, but maybe there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 1: '?'. Let's check (0,0) which is 1. (0,0) adjacent cells: (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,0) is 1, so one mine among these three. If we uncover (0,1), if it's a number, we can get more info. But maybe there's a safer cell.\n\nAnother area: row 0, column 9 is '?'. Let's check (0,8) which is 1. (0,8) adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9), (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=2. (0,8) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,9), (1,8), (1,9). (1,8) is 1 (safe), (1,9) is 2 (safe). So the mine must be (0,9). So (0,9) is a mine? Maybe, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a 0 that we missed. Wait, row 5, column 7 is 1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\"). (5,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,6)=0, (4,7)=1, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. As before, (5,7)=1, so if (6,8) is a mine (flagged), that's the one mine, so (5,7) is satisfied. So (6,8) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is F. Let's check (7,2)=1. (7,2) adjacent cells: (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. (7,2)=1, so one mine in adjacent cells. If (7,3) is a mine, that's the one, so (7,2) is satisfied. So (7,3) is a correct flag. So those two flags are correct (score 0.2).\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, in row 3, column 4: the input example shows 'uncover (3,4)', but let's check the current board. The current board row 3 is \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\". So (3,4) is 1, which is already uncovered. Maybe I misread. Let's list the rows properly:\n\nRow 0: 1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLet's check row 4, column 9: it's '?'. The cell (4,8) is 1 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,8)=1). (4,8) adjacent cells are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). \n\n(3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0 (row 4, column 7 is 0), (4,9) is '?', (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. \n\n(4,8) is 1, so one mine in adjacent cells. Let's count known safe cells: (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe), (3,9)=1 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (5,9)=2 (safe). So the only unknown is (4,9). So (4,8)=1 implies that (4,9) is either a mine or not. If (4,9) is a mine, then (4,8) is 1, which fits. If not, then there's a mine elsewhere, but all other adjacent cells are safe, so (4,9) must be the mine. Wait, no: (4,8) is 1, so exactly one mine in adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are uncovered and safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So the only possible mine is (4,9). Therefore, (4,9) is a mine? But let's check (5,8)=2. (5,8) adjacent cells: (4,7), (4,8), (4,9), (5,7), (5,9), (6,7), (6,8), (6,9). \n\n(4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)='?', (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. \n\n(5,8)=2, so two mines in adjacent cells. Let's see: (6,8)=F (flagged as mine, possibly correct). If (6,8) is a mine, that's one. Then (4,9) could be the second mine. So (5,8)=2 would have (6,8) and (4,9) as mines, which fits. So (4,9) is likely a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which means it's safe. For example, row 2, column 5 is 0 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,5)=0). A 0 cell means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,5)=0:\n\n(1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6).\n\nCheck these cells:\n\n(1,4)=2 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,6)=0 (uncovered), (2,4)=1 (uncovered), (2,6)=0 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,6)=0 (uncovered). All are uncovered, so no help.\n\nRow 2, column 6=0: adjacent cells (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), (2,5), (2,7), (3,5), (3,6), (3,7). All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 7=0: adjacent cells (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), (2,6), (2,8), (3,6), (3,7), (3,8). (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,8)=0 (row 2, column 8 is 0?), row 2 is \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\", so (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. So (2,8)=0. Then (2,8)=0's adjacent cells: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), (2,7), (2,9), (3,7), (3,8), (3,9). (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. All uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 8=1 (row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,8)=1). (1,8)=1's adjacent cells: (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9). (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9)='?', (1,7)=0, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. So (1,8)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. The only unknown is (0,9). So (0,9) must be a mine. So (0,9) is a mine.\n\nIf (0,9) is a mine, then we could flag it, but the user's current flags are 2\/10, so maybe they need to flag more. But the task is to choose an action: uncover, flag, or unflag.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. For example, row 4, column 9 is '?', but we think it's a mine. What about row 0, column 1: '?'. Let's see (0,0)=1, which has adjacent cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). If (0,1) is uncovered and is a number, we can get info. But maybe there's a better cell.\n\nWait, row 10, column 3 is '?'. Let's check (10,2)=1. (10,2) adjacent cells: (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. All these are safe (numbers), so the only unknown is (10,3). (10,2)=1 means exactly one mine in adjacent cells. Since all other adjacent cells are safe, (10,3) must be the mine. So (10,3) is a mine. So we could flag it, but maybe we can uncover a safe cell.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9 is '?', which we think is a mine. What about row 0, column 4: '?'. (0,5)=1 (row 0, column 5=1). (0,5) adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0. (0,5)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. (0,6)=0 and (1,6)=0 are safe, so the mine is either (0,4) or (1,4) or (1,5). (1,5)=1 is safe, (1,4)=2 is safe (since it's a number, not a mine). So (0,4) must be the mine. So (0,4) is a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 1 and has only one unknown cell. For example, row 3, column 8=1 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,8)=1). (3,8) adjacent cells: (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)='?'. (3,8)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. All adjacent cells except (4,9) are safe (0 or 1, which are not mines). So (4,9) must be the mine. So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nSince we need to choose an action, and uncovering a safe cell is better. Let's find a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check row 2, column 3: '?'. (2,2)=3 (row 2, column 2=3). (2,2) adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. (3,2)=2 and (3,3)=1 are safe. So (2,2)=3 means three mines in the remaining cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Not sure.\n\nAnother cell: row 1, column 3: '?'. (1,4)=2 (row 1, column 4=2). (1,4) adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)=1, (1,3), (1,5)=1, (2,3), (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. (0,5)=1, (1,5)=1, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0 are safe. So (1,4)=2 means two mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3). Not sure.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell's adjacent '?' that we missed. Wait, row 5, column 0-5 are 0s. (5,0)=0, adjacent cells (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 0-4 are 1s and 1s. (8,2)=1, adjacent cells (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1. (7,3)=F is a flagged mine, which if correct, then (8,2)=1 is satisfied (one mine at (7,3)).\n\nNow, let's think about the win condition: uncover all safe cells or flag all mines. Since there are 10 mines, and 2 are correctly flagged, we need to flag 8 more or uncover all safe cells.\n\nUncovering a safe cell that is adjacent to a 0 would be safe. For example, let's check row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0, so their adjacent cells are safe. But those are already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is row 3, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 5=0: adjacent cells (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nHow about row 2, column 9=0 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,9)=0). (2,9)=0's adjacent cells: (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All these are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 1, column 10=2 (row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,10)=2). (1,10) adjacent cells: (0,9)='?', (0,10)='?', (0,11)='?', (1,9)=1, (1,11)='?', (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)='?'. (1,10)=2 means two mines in these cells. (2,9)=0 is safe, (1,9)=1 is safe. So mines could be in (0,9), (0,10), (0,11), (1,11), (2,11). Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is likely safe. Let's look at row 4, column 9: '?'. We think it's a mine, so don't uncover. How about row 0, column 1: '?'. Let's assume it's safe. Or row 1, column 0: '?'.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 3, column 0: '?'. (3,0) is in row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\". (3,0) adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=3, (3,1), (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (2,2)=3 is a number, so safe. (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1 are safe. So (3,0) adjacent cells have (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=3, (3,1), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (2,2)=3 is a number, so not a mine. The others are '?'. Not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we need to make moves until then. The best safe move is to uncover a cell adjacent to a 0. Wait, row 5, column 7=1. (5,7) adjacent cells include (6,8)=F (flagged mine). If (6,8) is a mine, then (5,7)=1 is satisfied. So (6,8) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 7, column 3=F. (7,3) adjacent cells include (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. (7,2)=1 has (7,3)=F as a possible mine, so (7,3) is a correct flag.\n\nNow, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. Let's check row 10, column 3: '?'. We think it's a mine. What about row 0, column 2: '?'. (0,0)=1, (0,1)='?', (0,2)='?', (0,3)='?', (0,4)='?', (0,5)=1. Not helpful.\n\nWait, row 2, column 4=1 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,4)=1). (2,4) adjacent cells: (1,3)='?', (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (2,3)='?', (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0 are safe. So (2,4)=1 means one mine in (1,3) or (2,3). So either (1,3) or (2,3) is a mine, but not both.\n\nIf we uncover (2,3), which is '?', if it's a number, we can get info. For example, if (2,3) is 1, then (1,3) must be a mine. If (2,3) is 2, then both (1,3) and another cell are mines. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to multiple 0s, hence safe. For example, row 3, column 7=0 (row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,7)=0). (3,7)=0's adjacent cells: (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All these are uncovered, so no '?' there.\n\nRow 4, column 7=0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,7)=0). (4,7)=0's adjacent cells: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All uncovered.\n\nI think the best move is to uncover a cell that is likely safe. Let's pick row 4, column 9: but we think it's a mine. No. How about row 0, column 1: '?'. Let's assume it's safe. Or row 1, column 0: '?'.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 10, column 3: '?'. We think it's a mine, so flagging it would increase the score. But the user has 2 flags, so flagging a third mine (if correct) would increase the score to 0.3. But we need to be sure. Earlier analysis suggested (10,3) is a mine because (10,2)=1 and all other adjacent cells are safe, so (10,3) must be the mine. So let's flag (10,3).\n\nBut wait, the current action could be to uncover a safe cell. Let's check row 0, column 8=1 (row 0: \"1 ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" so (0,8)=1). (0,8) adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)='?', (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. (0,8)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. (0,7)=0 and (1,7)=0 are safe, (1,8)=1 and (1,9)=1 are safe. So the mine must be (0,9). So (0,9) is a mine. So we could flag (0,9).\n\nBut the user's current flags are 2\/10, so if we flag (0,9) and it's correct, the score becomes 3\/10=0.3. But how do we know it's correct? From (0,8)=1, which requires one mine in adjacent cells, and (0,9) is the only unknown, so yes, (0,9) is a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's confirm with (1,9)=1 (row 1, column 9=1). (1,9) adjacent cells: (0,8)=1, (0,9)='?', (0,10)='?', (1,8)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (1,9)=1 means one mine in adjacent cells. (0,8)=1, (1,8)=1, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1 are safe. So the mine is either (0,9) or (0,10) or (1,10). (1,10)=2 is a number, so safe. So (0,9) or (0,10) is the mine. But (0,8)=1 requires one mine, which is (0,9), so (0,9) is the mine. Therefore, (0,9) is a mine. So flagging (0,9) is a good move.\n\nBut the question is, what's the best action now. The user might want to uncover a safe cell to progress. Let's find a safe cell.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9 is '?', which we think is a mine. Row 0, column 9 is '?', mine. Row 10, column 3 is '?', mine.\n\nWhat about row 1, column 7=0 (row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,7)=0). (1,7)=0's adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 7=0: adjacent cells (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1. All uncovered.\n\nI think the safest move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is '?'. Wait, are there any '?' cells adjacent to 0s? Let's check all 0 cells and their adjacent '?'.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 6=0: adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 0, column 7=0: adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1.

All uncovered.\n\nRow 12, all columns are 0, and their adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 cells have all adjacent cells uncovered. Therefore, the remaining '?' cells are not adjacent to 0s, so they are either next to numbers or mines.\n\nIn that case, the best move is to uncover a cell that is most likely safe. Let's pick row 0, column 1. Uncovering (0,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,1)","uncover (0,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user has provided the current board, which is a 13x9 grid? Wait, wait, the problem says the board is 9x9, but the current board shows 13 rows. Maybe that's a formatting error. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the user pasted the board rows as separate lines, so let's count: 13 lines. But the game is 9x9, so perhaps it's a typo. Maybe each line is a row, so rows 0 to 8? Let's assume that. Let me parse the current board correctly.\n\nThe board rows are given as:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? (Wait, 13 elements here. That's confusing. The Minesweeper grid is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Maybe the input has a mistake in formatting. Let's assume that maybe each row is 9 cells, and perhaps the user made a typo in spacing. Alternatively, maybe the current board is presented with some rows split. Hmm. Let's try to focus on the relevant parts. The user's goal is to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells. The score is 0.2, which means 2 correct flags (since 2\/10 = 0.2). The flags count is 2\/10, so there are 2 flags placed, and 0 unflags. \n\nLooking at the current board, let's look for cells marked 'F' which are flagged. Let's check each row:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 → There's an 'F' at position (6,8) (assuming rows start at 0, columns 0-8). \n\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 → 'F' at (7,3). \n\nSo those are the two flagged cells. The score is 0.2, which is 2\/10, so these two flags are correct mines. So the user has correctly flagged 2 mines so far. \n\nNow, the game can end by either uncovering all safe cells (non-mine cells) or correctly flagging all 10 mines. Since there are 10 mines total, and 2 are correctly flagged, the user needs to flag 8 more. Alternatively, if they can uncover all safe cells, that's also a win. But since the game ends at the 100th epoch or uncovering a mine, the user wants to make moves that don't hit a mine.\n\nLet's look for cells that can be safely uncovered. In Minesweeper, when a cell shows a number, it indicates the number of mines in the adjacent 8 cells. If a cell is '0', all adjacent cells are safe, so they can be uncovered automatically. Let's check for 0s in the board.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\" → columns 6 and 7 are 0. So (0,6) and (0,7) are 0. Their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) should all be safe. Let's check row 0, column 6 (0,6) is 0. Adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 1, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. So (1,6) and (1,7) are 0, which would mean their adjacent cells are also safe.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ...\" → columns 6 and 7 are 0. So (1,6) and (1,7) are 0. Their adjacent cells: (0,5-7), (1,5-8), (2,5-7). (1,6) is 0, so (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7) should all be safe. (1,7) is 0, same logic.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" → columns 5,6,7,8 are 0. So (2,5) is 1, (2,6) 0, (2,7) 0, (2,8) 0. So (2,6), (2,7), (2,8) are 0. Their adjacent cells should be safe.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\" → columns 5,6,7 are 0. So (3,5), (3,6), (3,7) are 0. Adjacent cells here would be safe.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\" → columns 3-7 are 0. So (4,3) 0, (4,4) 0, (4,5) 0, (4,6) 0, (4,7) 0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ...\" → columns 0-6 are 0. So (5,0) to (5,6) are 0. Their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F ...\" → columns 0,1 are 0. (6,0), (6,1) are 0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 ...\" → (7,0), (7,1) are 0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" → columns 6,7,8 are 0. (8,6), (8,7), (8,8) are 0.\n\nSo there are a lot of 0 cells, which means their adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. The '?' cells are unknown. The goal is to uncover safe cells (non-mine) or flag mines.\n\nLooking for '?' cells that are adjacent to numbers which can be deduced. Let's take a cell that is a '?'. For example, let's look at row 0, column 2 (0,2). It's a '?'. Let's see adjacent numbers. The cell (0,0) is 1, (0,1) is 1, (1,0) is '?', (1,1) is '?', (1,2) is '?'. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAnother example: row 0, column 4 (0,4) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (0,3) '?', (0,5) 1, (1,3) '?', (1,4) 2, (1,5) 1. (0,5) is 1, which has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,5) is at (0,5), adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6)=0, (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)=0. So (0,5) has adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). (0,5) is 1, so among these three, there's 1 mine. (1,4) is 2. Let's check (1,4)=2. Its adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)=1, (1,3), (1,5)=1, (2,3), (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. So (1,4) has 8 adjacent cells. The 2 indicates there are 2 mines here. Let's list them: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But (0,5)=1, (2,5)=0. So (0,5) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. (2,5)=0, so not a mine. So the possible mines are (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4). (1,5)=1, which is a number, not a mine. So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in those 5 cells. (0,5)=1's adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1. (0,5) is 1, so among these three, 1 mine. (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in its adjacent, which includes (0,4) and (1,5) (but (1,5)=1 is a number, so not a mine). So (1,5) is 1, which is a number, so (1,5) is safe. So (0,5)=1's adjacent cells: (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). (1,5) is safe, so (0,4) and (1,4) must have 1 mine between them. But (1,4)=2, which is a number, so (1,4) is safe. So (0,4) must be the mine? Wait, no. (1,4) is a cell that's uncovered and shows 2, so it's a safe cell (not a mine). So (0,5) has adjacent cells: (0,4) (unknown), (1,4) (safe, shows 2), (1,5) (safe, shows 1). So (0,5)=1 means there's 1 mine in (0,4), (1,3), (2,3), (2,4) (since (1,4) is safe, (1,5) is safe). Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, in row 4, columns 3-7 are 0. So (4,3)=0, which means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (4,3)'s adjacent cells: (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (4,3)=0, so all these cells are safe. Let's see what's in those cells:\n\n(3,2) is 2 (from row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\" → (3,2)=2, which is a number, so safe. (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (5,2)=0 (safe), (5,3)=0 (safe), (5,4)=0 (safe). So all adjacent cells to (4,3) are safe, which checks out.\n\nAnother 0 cell is row 5, column 0: (5,0)=0. Adjacent cells: (4,0), (4,1), (5,1), (6,0), (6,1). Let's check those cells:\n\n(4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (5,1)=0 (safe), (6,0)=0 (safe), (6,1)=0 (safe). All safe, correct.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 2, column 8 is 0. Its adjacent cells would include (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9) but maybe the grid is 9x9, so column 8 is the last. So (2,8)=0's adjacent cells: (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,7)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1. All these are safe, so (2,8)=0 is correct.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 8? The first row is \"1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" which might be a formatting error, but assuming 9 columns, row 0 has columns 0-8: [1,1,?, ?, ?,1,0,0,1]. So (0,8)=1. Its adjacent cells would be (0,7)=0, (0,9) which is out of bounds, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9) out of bounds. So (0,8)=1 has adjacent cells (0,7)=0 (safe), (1,7)=0 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe). So the 1 in (0,8) indicates 1 mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells would be (0,7) (safe), (0,9) (invalid), (1,7) (safe), (1,8) (safe), (1,9) (invalid), (2,7)=0 (safe), (2,8)=0 (safe), (2,9) (invalid). Wait, maybe (0,8) has adjacent cells (0,7), (1,7), (1,8), (2,7), (2,8). All of which are 0,0,1,0,0. So (0,8)=1's adjacent cells have 1 mine. But all those cells are numbers (0 or 1), which are safe. So that suggests that maybe (0,8)=1's adjacent cells include a mine that's not yet uncovered. But perhaps (0,8) is a number, so it's safe, and the mine is in one of the adjacent cells that's a '?'.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 can be uncovered safely. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 2, column 5 is 0 (from row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" → (2,5)=0). The adjacent cells to (2,5)=0 are (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0. All of these are numbers, so safe. So (2,5)=0's adjacent cells are all safe, which is correct.\n\nAnother 0 cell is row 3, column 5: (3,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All safe.\n\nLet's look at row 1, column 8: (1,8)=1 (from row 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (1,8)=1). Its adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9) invalid, (1,7)=0, (1,9) invalid, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9) invalid. So (1,8)=1's adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. All of these are numbers, so safe. So the 1 in (1,8) must have a mine in one of the adjacent cells that's a '?'. But maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a number and can be determined. For example, row 6, column 8 is 'F' (flagged), which is correct. Row 7, column 3 is 'F' (flagged), correct. Let's check row 6, column 8: (6,8)=F. Its adjacent cells: (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,9) invalid, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (7,9) invalid, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. The cell (6,7)=1: (6,7)=1's adjacent cells include (6,8)=F (mine), so that 1 is accounted for by the flagged mine. That makes sense. (6,7)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which is (6,8)=F, so that's correct.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is 'F'. Let's check (7,3)=F. Adjacent cells: (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. The cell (7,2)=1: (7,2)=1's adjacent cells include (7,3)=F (mine), so that 1 is accounted for. Correct.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that must be safe. For example, in row 2, column 2: (2,2)=3. Let's see its adjacent cells. (2,2)=3 means there are 3 mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Let's list them: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). \n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" → (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, etc.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\" → (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, etc.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 ...\" → (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, etc.\n\nSo (2,2)=3's adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\nAmong these, (3,2)=2 and (3,3)=1 are safe (they are numbers). So the 3 mines must be in the 6 '?' cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nNow, (3,2)=2. Let's check (3,2)=2's adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2)=3, (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. So (3,2)=2 has adjacent cells. The 2 indicates 2 mines in these. (2,2)=3 is a number (safe), (3,3)=1 is safe, (4,3)=0 is safe. So the possible mines are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nBut (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). And (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Let's denote X = number of mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Then (3,2)=2 → X=2. Then (2,2)=3 → 3 = mines in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) + X → mines in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) = 3 - X = 3-2=1. So there is 1 mine among (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nNow, let's check (1,4)=2. (1,4)=2's adjacent cells include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)=1, (1,3), (1,5)=1, (2,3), (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. (0,5)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe). So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3). \n\nIf (1,3) is a mine (part of the 1 mine in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)), then (1,4)=2's mines would include (1,3) and one more. If (1,3) is not a mine, then the 1 mine is in (1,1) or (1,2), and (1,3) is safe, so (1,4)=2's mines would be two of (0,3), (0,4), (2,3). \n\nThis is getting complex. Maybe instead of trying to find mines, look for safe cells to uncover. The safest moves are to uncover cells that are adjacent to 0s, as those are guaranteed to be safe. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0.\n\nLooking at row 4, columns 3-7 are 0. Let's check row 4, column 8: (4,8)=1 (from row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\"). (4,8)=1's adjacent cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,7)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. (3,7)=0 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), so (4,8)=1's adjacent cells have 1 mine. The adjacent cells are (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe). So the mine must be in (3,8) or (5,8) or elsewhere? No, (3,8)=1 is a number, so safe. (5,8)=2 is a number, safe. So maybe (4,8)=1's mine is in (3,8) or (5,8), but those are numbers, so perhaps (4,8)=1 is a number, so it's safe.\n\nAnother 0 cell is row 5, column 7: (5,7)=1 (from row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ...\"). So (5,7)=1. Its adjacent cells: (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. (6,8)=F is a mine, so (5,7)=1's adjacent cells include (6,8)=F (mine), which accounts for the 1. So (5,7)=1 is correct.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that's adjacent to a 0. For example, row 2, column 0: (2,0)=? (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 ...\"). Let's check adjacent cells to (2,0). The adjacent cells are (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 0, column 2: (0,2)=? (row 0: \"1 1 ? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ...\"). Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?. (0,1)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,1) is at (0,1), adjacent cells are (0,0)=1, (0,2)=?, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?. (0,0)=1 is a number (safe), so (0,1)=1 has 1 mine in (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2).\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0, which is guaranteed to be safe. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 8 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,7)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1. All are safe.\n\nRow 3, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 4, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All safe.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=1 (if row 9 exists), etc. But since the grid is 9x9, rows 0-8, columns 0-8.\n\nWait, perhaps the board provided has more rows than 9, but maybe it's a mistake. Let's assume the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8, each with 9 columns. Let's re-express the board correctly.\n\nAssuming each row is 9 cells:\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, ?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 1: [?, ?, ?, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 2: [?, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, F]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThat makes more sense. So 9 rows, 9 columns each. Now, let's check the '?' cells.\n\nRow 0 has '?' at (0,2), (0,3), (0,4).\n\nRow 1 has '?' at (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nRow 2 has '?' at (2,0), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nRow 3 has '?' at (3,0), (3,1).\n\nNow, let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, (0,6) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All safe. (0,7)=0, adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 1, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 1, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 2, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. So (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. Their adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nRow 3, columns 5-7 are 0, 0, 0. (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 4, columns 3-7 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-6 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. (5,0)=0 to (5,6)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 6, columns 0-1 are 0, 0. (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 7, columns 0-1 are 0, 0. (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 8, columns 6-8 are 0, 0, 0. (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Adjacent cells safe.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells that are adjacent to these 0s. For example, (3,0) and (3,1) are '?'. Let's check their adjacent cells.\n\n(3,0) is in row 3, column 0. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. \n\n(3,1) is in row 3, column 1. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (3,0)=?, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\nNot adjacent to 0s. How about (2,0) and (2,1):\n\n(2,0) adjacent cells: (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2. No 0s.\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) are '?'. Their adjacent cells don't include 0s.\n\nRow 0, (0,2), (0,3), (0,4) are '?'. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,2) adjacent: (0,1)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?.\n\n(0,3) adjacent: (0,2)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=1, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2.\n\n(0,4) adjacent: (0,3)=?, (0,5)=1, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1.\n\n(1,4)=2 is in row 1, column 4. Let's check (1,4)=2. Its adjacent cells are (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=1, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. (0,5)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe). So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3).\n\n(2,4)=1 is in row 2, column 4. Its adjacent cells are (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe). So (2,4)=1 has 1 mine in (1,3), (2,3).\n\nSo (2,4)=1 has 1 mine in (1,3), (2,3). And (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3). Since (1,3) and (2,3) have 1 mine (from (2,4)=1), then (0,3), (0,4) must have 1 mine (because 2 total - 1 from (1,3)\/(2,3) = 1).\n\nSo (0,3) and (0,4) have 1 mine between them. That means one is a mine, the other is safe.\n\nIf I uncover (0,3) or (0,4), there's a 50% chance of hitting a mine. Not ideal.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (2,3) is '?'. (2,4)=1 says there's 1 mine in (1,3) and (2,3). If (2,3) is a mine, then (1,3) is safe. If (2,3) is safe, then (1,3) is a mine.\n\nBut we don't know. Let's think of another approach. The user has 2 correct flags, needs 8 more. But flagging requires knowing where the mines are, which is hard. The other way to win is to uncover all safe cells. So the user should uncover as many safe cells as possible.\n\nThe safest cells to uncover are those adjacent to 0s. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Wait, all the 0 cells have their adjacent cells already uncovered (since 0 means all adjacent are safe, so they would have been uncovered automatically). So the '?' cells are not adjacent to 0s, which means they are adjacent to numbers. So the remaining '?' cells are all adjacent to numbers, so they could be mines or safe.\n\nIn that case, the best move is to choose a '?' cell that is least likely to be a mine. For example, look for a cell with the lowest probability.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that, when uncovered, will reveal a number that helps deduce more mines.\n\nLet's take (3,0) in row 3, column 0. It's a '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (3,1)=?, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1 are all numbers, so safe. (2,2)=3 is a number, safe. So (3,0) is adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), which are '?', and (2,2)=3, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. The (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in its adjacent cells, which include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). If (3,0) is uncovered and is a number, say 1, it might help. But without more info, it's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, column 3: (2,3)=?. (2,3) is adjacent to (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=3, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1. (1,4)=2, (2,2)=3, (2,4)=1, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1 are all numbers (safe). So (2,3) is adjacent to (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, which are '?'. (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells, which include (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). (2,4)=1 has 1 mine in (1,3), (2,3). So (2,3) could be a mine. If (2,3) is a mine, then (1,3) is safe (from (2,4)=1), and (2,2)=3's mines would be (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) → but (1,3) is safe, so (1,2) and (2,3) would be 2 mines, but (2,2)=3 needs 3. So maybe (2,3) is not a mine. This is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick a cell that's in a region with many 0s, so the chance of it being a mine is low. For example, row 0, column 2: (0,2)=?. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?. (0,1)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which are (0,0)=1, (0,2)=?, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?. (0,0)=1 is a number (safe), so (0,1)=1 has 1 mine in (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). So the probability of (0,2) being a mine is 1\/4. That's 25% chance, which is better than 50%.\n\nAlternatively, (1,3)=? is adjacent to (1,4)=2, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1. (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3). (2,4)=1 has 1 mine in (1,3), (2,3). So if (1,3) is a mine, then (2,3) is safe, and (1,4)=2 would need 1 more mine in (0,3) or (0,4). If (1,3) is safe, then (2,3) is a mine, and (1,4)=2 needs 2 mines in (0,3) and (0,4). So (1,3) has a 50% chance of being a mine.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best move is to uncover a cell with the lowest probability. Let's go with (0,2), which has a 25% chance of being a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that's adjacent to a 1, which has only one mine in its adjacent cells. For example, (0,5)=1. Its adjacent cells are (0,4)=?, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0. (0,6)=0 and (1,6)=0 are safe, so (0,5)=1 has 1 mine in (0,4), (1,4), (1,5). (1,5)=1 is a number (safe), so (0,5)=1 has 1 mine in (0,4), (1,4). (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3). So (0,4) could be the mine for (0,5)=1, which would mean (1,4)=2's mines are (0,4) and one more. So (0,4) is a possible mine.\n\nBut I need to choose a move. Let's pick a cell that's likely safe. Let's say (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Looking at row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\", so (3,4)=1. Wait, (3,4) is already uncovered and shows 1. So that's not a '?'.\n\nWait, the current board has '?' cells. Let's list all '?' positions:\n\nRow 0: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4)\n\nRow 1: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3)\n\nRow 2: (2,0), (2,1), (2,3)\n\nRow 3: (3,0), (3,1)\n\nThese are all the '?' cells. Let's pick one of these. Let's choose (3,1). Why? Because (3,2)=2 is adjacent to (3,1). (3,2)=2's adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2)=3, (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. (2,2)=3, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0 are safe. So (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). If (3,1) is uncovered and is a number, say 1, then we can deduce that there's 1 mine in (2,1) and (2,3). But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick (4,8) which is 1, but it's already uncovered. No. The '?' cells are the ones we need to consider.\n\nAlternatively, let's pick (0,2). Uncovering (0,2) might reveal a number that helps. Let's go with that.\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,2)","uncover (0,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current state of the game. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the current display shows more rows and columns, maybe it's a typo, but I'll focus on the given data. The score is 0.2, which means 2 correct flags out of 10. The flags listed are 2\/10, so there are 2 F's on the board. Let's look at the current board:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, the original problem says it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board has 13 rows and 13 columns. Maybe that's a mistake, but I'll proceed. Let's list the F positions. In row 6, column 8 (since it's 0-based: row 6, the 8th element is F). Row 7, column 3 is F. So two flags there.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags \/ total mines, so we need to flag as many mines as possible.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells that must be mines (so we can flag them) or safe cells (so we can uncover them).\n\nLet's start with the known numbers. For example, in row 7, column 3 is F (flagged). Let's check the adjacent cells to see if that flag is correct. Row 7 is: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0. The cell to the left of F is (7,2) which is 1. The 1 at (7,2) has adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (7,2) are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,3) is the F. The 1 at (7,2) indicates there's 1 mine in those 8 cells. Since (7,3) is flagged as a mine, that would account for the 1, so that flag might be correct.\n\nRow 6 has F at (6,8). Let's check (6,7) which is 1. (6,7) is at row 6, column 7. Adjacent cells: (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (6,8) is F. The 1 at (6,7) would mean 1 mine in those cells. If (6,8) is a mine, that's the 1, so that flag might also be correct. So those two flags are probably correct, hence the score 0.2 (2\/10).\n\nNow, let's look for other cells where we can determine if they are mines or safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 2: value 3. Let's note that as (2,2) = 3. The adjacent cells to (2,2) are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). The cell (2,3) is '?', (2,1) is '?', (1,1) is '?', (1,2) is '?', (1,3) is '?', (3,1) is '?', (3,2) is 2, (3,3) is 1. The 3 at (2,2) means there are 3 mines in those 8 cells. Let's see if we can find other clues.\n\nRow 3, column 2 is 2. (3,2) = 2. Adjacent cells: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3). (2,2) is 3, (3,3) is 1, (4,2) is 1, (4,3) is 0. So (3,2) has 2 mines in its adjacent cells. Let's see if (3,1) is '?', (2,1) is '?', (2,3) is '?'.\n\nRow 2, column 4 is 1. (2,4) = 1. Adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 1, (2,5) is 0, (3,3) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (3,5) is 0. So (2,4) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (1,3) is '?', (2,3) is '?'.\n\nRow 1, column 4 is 2. (1,4) = 2. Adjacent cells: (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,5) is 1, (1,5) is 1, (2,4) is 1, (2,5) is 0. So (1,4) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The '?' cells here are (0,3), (0,4), (1,3), (2,3).\n\nRow 0, column 5 is 1. (0,5) = 1. Adjacent cells: (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6) is 0, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0. So (0,5) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The '?' cells here are (0,4).\n\nPutting this together: (0,5) is 1, and (0,4) is '?'. The adjacent cells of (0,5) are (0,4), (0,6=0), (1,4=2), (1,5=1), (1,6=0). So the 1 mine must be in (0,4), because (1,4) and (1,5) are numbers, not mines. Wait, no: the numbers are the count of adjacent mines, so (1,4)=2 means there are 2 mines around it, which includes (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). (0,5) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. So (0,5) is safe. The 1 at (0,5) means that among its 8 adjacent cells (I might have missed some: (0,5) is row 0, column 5. So adjacent cells are (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1), but row 0 can't have row-1. So adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). That's 5 cells. Since (0,5) is 1, there's 1 mine in those 5 cells. (0,6)=0 (so safe), (1,6)=0 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe, as it's a number). So the mine must be in (0,4) or (1,4). But (1,4)=2, which is a number (safe). So (1,4) is safe, so the mine is in (0,4). Therefore, (0,4) is a mine. So we should flag (0,4).\n\nWait, let's confirm. (0,5) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6) is 0 (so not a mine), (1,6) is 0 (not a mine), (1,5) is 1 (not a mine, since it's a number indicating adjacent mines). (1,4) is 2 (not a mine). So the only possible mine is (0,4). Therefore, (0,4) must be a mine. So we should flag (0,4).\n\nAnother clue: row 10, column 3 is '?'. Row 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. (10,2) is 1. Adjacent cells to (10,2) are (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. So (10,2)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The '?' is (10,3). Let's check (10,3)'s adjacent cells. (10,3) is adjacent to (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (10,2), (10,4), (11,2), (11,3), (11,4). (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1. All these are numbers, so (10,3) is a '?', but if (10,2)=1, then the mine could be in (10,3) or (9,3) or (11,3). But (9,3)=1 (number, so safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So (10,3) might be a mine. But maybe not. Let's check other areas.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 3: '?'. (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2. (0,2)=1: adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?. The 1 at (0,2) means 1 mine in those 5 cells. (0,1)=1 is a number (safe), so the mine could be in (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nBut earlier, we thought (0,4) is a mine. Let's check (1,4)=2. (1,4)=2's adjacent cells include (0,3), (0,4), (0,5)=1, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines in those cells. We already think (0,4) is a mine, so that's 1. The other mine could be (0,3) or (1,3) or (2,3). Let's see (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3's adjacent cells: (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. So 3 mines here. If (2,3) is a mine, that's one. (1,3) could be another, (1,2) another. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell with 0 means all adjacent cells are safe. Let's find 0s.\n\nRow 0, columns 6 and 7 are 0. So (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0. Their adjacent cells are safe. (0,6) adjacent: (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All safe. (0,7)=0 adjacent: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. So (1,7)=0, which is a 0, so its adjacent cells are safe. (1,7)=0: adjacent cells (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. All safe. So (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. So (2,8)=0 adjacent: (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. So (3,7)=0: adjacent cells (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All these 0s indicate that cells around them are safe, so any '?' adjacent to 0s can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9: '?'. (4,9) is in row 4, column 9. Let's check adjacent cells. (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. The 1 at (4,8) is (4,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. So (4,8)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,7)=0 (safe), (3,8)=1 (safe), (3,9)=1 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (5,9)=2 (safe). So the mine must be in (4,9). Therefore, (4,9) is a mine. So we should flag (4,9).\n\nWait, (4,8)=1: adjacent cells are 8 cells. Let's list them properly:\n\n(4,8) is row 4, column 8.\n\nAdjacent cells:\n\nrow 3, column 7: (3,7)=0 (safe)\n\nrow 3, column 8: (3,8)=1 (safe)\n\nrow 3, column 9: (3,9)=1 (safe)\n\nrow 4, column 7: (4,7)=0 (safe)\n\nrow 4, column 9: (4,9)=? (unknown)\n\nrow 5, column 7: (5,7)=1 (safe)\n\nrow 5, column 8: (5,8)=2 (safe)\n\nrow 5, column 9: (5,9)=2 (safe)\n\nSo out of these 8 cells, 7 are safe (numbers), so the 1 mine must be in (4,9). Therefore, (4,9) is a mine. So we should flag (4,9).\n\nAnother 0 is in row 5, column 0-5: 0 0 0 0 0 0. So (5,0) to (5,5) are 0, meaning their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (5,5)=0, adjacent cells (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. All safe, so no mines there.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 3: '?'. (10,3) is in row 10, column 3. Adjacent cells: (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1. All these are numbers (safe), so (10,3) is a '?', but since all adjacent cells are numbers, it's possible that (10,3) is a safe cell. Wait, no: the numbers indicate the count of mines in their adjacent cells, not that they are mines. So (10,2)=1 means there's 1 mine in its adjacent cells, which include (10,3). If (10,3) is a mine, that would satisfy (10,2)=1. But if (10,3) is safe, then the mine must be in another adjacent cell of (10,2). But (9,3)=1 (a number, so safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So (10,2)=1's adjacent cells: (9,1)=0 (safe), (9,2)=1 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (10,1)=0 (safe), (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine is (10,3). So (10,3) is a mine. So flag (10,3).\n\nBut wait, let's check if we can find a safe cell to uncover. For example, any '?' that is adjacent to a 0. Let's look for 0s and their adjacent '?'.\n\nRow 0, columns 6 and 7 are 0. Adjacent cells: (0,6) is 0, so (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. (1,7)=0 is 0, so (1,8)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. (2,7)=0 and (2,8)=0, so (2,9)=0. (2,9)=0, adjacent cells (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. (3,7)=0, so (3,8)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. (4,7)=0, so (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,7)=1. All these 0s mean that any '?' adjacent to them is safe. Let's see row 0, column 8 is 1 (safe). Row 0, column 9 is '?'. Let's check (0,8)=1. (0,8) is row 0, column 8. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. (0,8)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,7)=0 (safe), (1,7)=0 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe), so the mine could be (0,9) or (1,9). (1,9)=1 (safe, as it's a number). So (0,9) is a mine? Or (1,9) is a mine? (1,9)=1: adjacent cells (0,8)=1, (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (1,8)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (1,9)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,8)=1 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe), (2,8)=0 (safe), (2,9)=0 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe). So the mine could be (0,9) or (0,10) or (1,10). (1,10)=2: adjacent cells (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?. (1,10)=2 has 2 mines here. This is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, any cell adjacent to a 0 must be safe. Let's find a 0 and see if there's a '?' next to it that can be uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 7 is 1. (5,7)=1: adjacent cells (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. (4,6)=0 and (4,7)=0 and (5,6)=0 and (6,6)=0 are all 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. So (5,7)=1's adjacent cells include (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe), (6,8)=F (flagged). So the 1 mine here is probably the F at (6,8), which we already considered as correct.\n\nRow 6, column 7 is 1. (6,7)=1: adjacent cells (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. The 1 here is likely the F at (6,8), so correct.\n\nRow 7, column 7 is 1. (7,7)=1: adjacent cells (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=0, (7,8)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. So the 1 mine here is the F at (6,8), which is already counted.\n\nRow 8, columns 6-8 are 0. (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Their adjacent cells are safe. So (8,9)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=0, etc. So any '?' adjacent to these 0s can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9: '?', which we thought was a mine. Let's confirm again. (4,8)=1: adjacent cells include (4,9)=?, and the rest are safe. So (4,9) must be a mine. So flag (4,9).\n\nAnother possible safe cell: row 3, column 4 is 1. (3,4)=1: adjacent cells (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. (2,5)=0, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0 are all 0s, so their adjacent cells are safe. So (3,4)=1's adjacent cells: (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). The 1 mine here is in (2,3). So (2,3) is a mine. So flag (2,3).\n\nWait, (3,4)=1: adjacent cells are 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(2,3), (2,4), (2,5),\n\n(3,3), (3,5),\n\n(4,3), (4,4), (4,5).\n\n(2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe), (4,3)=0 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=0 (safe). So only (2,3) is '?', so the 1 mine must be in (2,3). Therefore, (2,3) is a mine. So flag (2,3).\n\nThat's another mine. So far, we have (0,4), (2,3), (4,9), (10,3) as possible mines. But let's verify.\n\nIf (2,3) is a mine, then (2,2)=3 (row 2, column 2) has adjacent cells including (2,3). (2,2)=3's adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n\n(2,1), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nWe now know (2,3) is a mine (1 mine). (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So the other 2 mines must be in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,1). Let's check (3,2)=2. (3,2)=2's adjacent cells:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,3),\n\n(4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\n(2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=mine (1), (3,3)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,3)=0 (safe). So (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in (2,1), (3,1). So (2,1) and (3,1) are mines. That's 2 more mines. So (2,1) and (3,1) are mines.\n\nSo (2,1) and (3,1) are mines. So we should flag those.\n\nNow, (1,2)=? is adjacent to (2,2)=3. If (2,1) and (3,1) are mines, then (2,2)=3 has mines in (2,3), (2,1), (3,1) → that's 3 mines, which matches the 3. So that's correct. So (2,1), (3,1), (2,3) are mines.\n\nThen (1,2) is adjacent to (2,2)=3, but since the 3 mines are already accounted for, (1,2) must be safe. So (1,2) can be uncovered.\n\nLet's confirm (1,2)=?. (1,2) is row 1, column 2. Adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=mine. (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=mine. So (1,2) has 2 mines adjacent (2,1 and 2,3). If (1,2) is a number, it would be 2, but since it's '?', we can uncover it safely because it's not a mine.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (1,2) is safe. Or (1,6)=0, which is already uncovered. Let's look for '?' that are adjacent to 0s.\n\nRow 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. Adjacent to them is row 1, column 6=0, row 1, column 7=0. So row 2, column 6=0, row 2, column 7=0, row 2, column 8=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. Let's look at row 2, column 9=0 (from the board: row 2: ... 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?). Wait, row 2 in the given board is: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?. So row 2, columns 5-9 are 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. So (2,9)=0, adjacent cells are (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All these are numbers, so (2,9)=0 is safe, and its adjacent cells are safe. So any '?' adjacent to (2,9)=0 can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 3, column 10=2. (3,10)=2: adjacent cells (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0. (2,9)=0 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe), (3,9)=1 (safe), (3,11)=1 (safe), (4,10)=1 (safe), (4,11)=0 (safe). So the 2 mines here are (2,11) and (4,9). We already thought (4,9) is a mine, so (2,11) is another mine. So flag (2,11).\n\nBut maybe instead of flagging, we should uncover a safe cell to avoid hitting a mine. Let's find a '?' that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 3=0. (4,3)=0: adjacent cells are all safe. So (4,3)=0, so (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All safe, so any '?' adjacent to (4,3)=0 is safe.\n\nRow 3, column 0=?: (3,0) is '?'. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=3, (3,1)=mine, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (2,1)=mine, (3,1)=mine, (3,2)=2 (safe), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,0) is adjacent to 2 mines, so if uncovered, it would show 2, but it's safe. So (3,0) can be uncovered.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 2=?: we determined it's safe. Let's check (1,2). Adjacent mines are (2,1) and (2,3), so (1,2) should be 2, so it's safe. Uncovering (1,2) is safe.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 0, column 2=1. Adjacent to (0,2)=1 is (0,3)=?, which we thought might be a mine, but (0,2)=1's adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=safe, (1,3)=?. If (1,2) is safe, then (0,2)=1's mine count is 1, which could be (0,3). But (0,3) might be a mine, so better to avoid.\n\nThe safest move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to multiple 0s. Let's look at row 2, column 6=0, row 2, column 7=0, row 2, column 8=0, row 2, column 9=0. These 0s are in a cluster, so any '?' adjacent to them is safe. Let's check row 3, column 7=0 (from the board: row 3: ... 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1). Yes, row 3, column 6=0, row 3, column 7=0. So (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. Their adjacent cells are safe. So row 4, column 6=0, row 4, column 7=0. These are all 0s, so any '?' in their vicinity is safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9=? (which we think is a mine), but row 4, column 8=1 (safe). Row 4, column 10=1 (safe). So maybe row 4, column 9 is a mine, but we can't be 100% sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 7=1, row 5, column 8=2, row 5, column 9=2, row 5, column 10=1. These are all numbers, so the '?' in row 0, column 3, 4, 9, 10, 11; row 1, 0-3, 9-11; row 2, 0-1, 3, 11-12; row 3, 0-1; row 4, 9; row 10, 3; etc.\n\nThe best bet is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0, ensuring it's safe. Let's pick row 1, column 6=0 (from the board: row 1: ... 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?). Row 1, column 6=0, column 7=0. So (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. Adjacent cells to (1,6)=0 are (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All safe, so any '?' adjacent to (1,6)=0 is safe. The '?' in row 1, column 8=1 (already uncovered), row 1, column 9=1 (uncovered), row 1, column 10=2 (uncovered), row 1, column 11=? (unknown). (1,11)=? is adjacent to (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (0,12)=?, (1,10)=2, (1,12)=?, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (2,12)=?. Not helpful.\n\nAnother 0 cluster: row 6, columns 0-5: 0 0 1 1 1 0. Row 6, column 5=0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All safe.\n\nLet's go back to the initial thought: (3,4) is in row 3, column 4. Looking at the current board, row 3 is: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1. So (3,4)=1. The cell (3,4) is already uncovered (it's a 1). So maybe I misread the board. Let's recheck the current board:\n\nCurrent Board (each row is space-separated):\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? ? ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: ? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo row 3, column 4 is 1 (already uncovered). The 'uncover' action should target a '?' cell. Let's find a '?' that is safe.\n\nLooking at row 4, column 9: '?'. We thought it's a mine, but let's check row 5, column 8=2. (5,8)=2: adjacent cells (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. (4,7)=0 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe), (6,8)=F (mine), (6,9)=1 (safe). So (5,8)=2 has 2 mines in (4,9) and (5,9). (5,9)=2: adjacent cells (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. (5,9)=2 has 2 mines in (4,9) and (6,8)=F. Since (6,8)=F is a mine, that's 1, so (4,9) is the other mine. So (4,9) is a mine. So flag (4,9).\n\nAnother '?' is row 10, column 3: '?'. Row 10, column 2=1. (10,2)=1: adjacent cells (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. (9,1)=0 (safe), (9,2)=1 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (10,1)=0 (safe), (11,1)=0 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So the 1 mine must be (10,3). So flag (10,3).\n\nBut the user's current score is 0.2 (2 correct flags), so we need to flag more. However, the question asks for an action, which could be uncover or flag. Since uncovering a safe cell is less risky, let's find a safe '?' to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 5=1 (already uncovered), row 2, column 6=0, row 2, column 7=0, row 2, column 8=0, row 2, column 9=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. The '?' in row 2, column 10=1 (already uncovered), row 2, column 11=?, row 2, column 12=?.\n\nRow 2, column 11=?: adjacent cells (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?, (1,12)=?, (2,10)=1, (2,12)=?, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=1. (1,10)=2 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe), (3,10)=2 (safe), (3,11)=1 (safe), (3,12)=1 (safe). So (2,11)=? is adjacent to safe cells, but we can't be sure.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 3, column 0=? (row 3, column 0). Adjacent cells (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1. (2,2)=3 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe). So (3,0)=? is safe if (2,0), (2,1), (3,1) are not mines. But we think (2,1) and (3,1) are mines, so (3,0) is adjacent to 2 mines, so it would be a 2, but it's safe. So uncovering (3,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 2=? (row 1, column 2). Adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=mine, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=mine. (2,1) and (2,3) are mines, so (1,2) is adjacent to 2 mines, so it's a 2, safe. Uncovering (1,2) is safe.\n\nLet's pick (1,2) as the cell to uncover. So the action is 'uncover (1,2)'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,2)","uncover (1,2)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to look at the current board and understand the state. The user has a score of 0.2, which means they've correctly flagged 2 mines out of 10. The board is a 13x9 grid (wait, wait, the problem says 9x9 grid, but the current board shown has 13 rows? Maybe that's a formatting error, maybe it's a typo. Let me check again. The Minesweeper rules say the board is 9x9, so maybe the current board display is a mistake. Let's assume it's 9x9. Maybe the rows are listed with some line breaks. Let me parse the board properly.\n\nLooking at the Current Board lines: Each line is a row. Let's count the rows. The user provided 13 lines, but the game is 9x9, so perhaps it's a formatting issue. Maybe each line is a row, but maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the board is presented in a way that's split for readability. Let's try to make sense of it.\n\nWait, the problem statement says \"the coordinate of the top-leftmost grid is (0, 0)\", so rows and columns start at 0. Let's list the rows as given, even if there are 13 rows. Maybe the user made a mistake in the board display. Let's proceed.\n\nThe goal is to either uncover all safe cells or flag all mines. The game ends at 100 epochs or uncovering a mine. The score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines based on the numbers.\n\nLet's take row 0: \"1 1 1 ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" — assuming columns 0-12 here, but 9x9 should be 0-8. Maybe the board is misrepresented. Alternatively, perhaps the user input the board with some errors. Let's focus on the cells that have numbers and flags.\n\nIn row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" — there's an F at (6,8). Row 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — F at (7,3). So two flags, which matches the \"Flags: 2\/10\" in the score.\n\nNow, let's look for cells where the number indicates adjacent mines, and the number of adjacent flags or known mines can help. For example, a cell with number 1 that has only one adjacent '?', that '?' is a mine. Or a cell with number 0, which means all adjacent cells are safe, so we can uncover those.\n\nLooking for 0 cells. For example, row 0 has \"0 0 1\" at columns 6-8. So (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1. A 0 cell means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check the adjacent cells of (0,6). (0,6) is 0, so cells around it: (0-1,6-1) to (0+1,6+1) — but (0,6) is at the top, so rows 0 and 1, columns 5-7. So (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0; (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. So (0,6) being 0 implies that all adjacent cells (which are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7), and also (0-1,6) which is invalid, (0-1,6-1) invalid, (0-1,6+1) invalid, (0,6-1)=(0,5), (0,6+1)=(0,7), (1,6-1)=(1,5), (1,6)=(1,6), (1,6+1)=(1,7)) — all these cells are safe, so any '?' adjacent to 0 can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" — (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. So their adjacent cells should be safe. For (1,6)=0, adjacent cells are (0,5-7), (1,5-7), (2,5-7). (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0; (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0; (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. So (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. These 0s would imply their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking for a 0 cell and uncovering adjacent '?'. For example, let's check row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" — (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are all safe. Let's take (4,3)=0. Adjacent cells are (3,2-4), (4,2-4), (5,2-4). (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1; (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All these are already uncovered, so no '?' there. (4,4)=0: adjacent cells (3,3-5), (4,3-5), (5,3-5). (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0; (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0; (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All uncovered. (4,5)=0: adjacent cells (3,4-6), (4,4-6), (5,4-6). (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0; (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0; (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. All uncovered. (4,6)=0: adjacent cells (3,5-7), (4,5-7), (5,5-7). (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0; (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0; (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1. (5,7)=1 is already uncovered. (4,7)=0: adjacent cells (3,6-8), (4,6-8), (5,6-8). (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1; (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1; (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All these are numbers, no '?'.\n\nLooking at row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" — (5,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,6-8), (5,6-8), (6,6-8). (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1; (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2; (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F (flagged). So (6,8) is F. The cell (5,8)=2. Let's check (5,8)=2: adjacent cells are (4,7-9), (5,7-9), (6,7-9). (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=? (since the board may be 9x9, maybe column 9 is beyond, but let's assume columns 0-8). If it's 9x9, columns 0-8. So (5,8)=2: adjacent cells (4,7), (4,8), (4,9) [invalid], (5,7), (5,9) [invalid], (6,7), (6,8), (6,9) [invalid]. So (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. So the 2 here would mean there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. Currently, (6,8) is flagged as a mine. So if that's correct, then there's 1 mine accounted for, so there should be 1 more mine in the adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (4,8)=1 (number, not a mine), (5,7)=1 (number), (6,7)=1 (number). So maybe (6,8) is a correct flag, but the 2 at (5,8) would require another mine, but maybe (5,8) is adjacent to (6,8) (F) and another mine. But this might not help immediately.\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers that have a known number of adjacent flags. For example, in row 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — (7,3)=F (flagged). The cell (7,2)=1. (7,2) is 1, which means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (7,2) are (6,1-3), (7,1-3), (8,1-3). (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1; (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F; (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. So (7,2) has adjacent cells: (6,2)=1 (number), (6,3)=1 (number), (7,3)=F (flagged), (8,2)=1 (number), (8,3)=1 (number). The 1 at (7,2) indicates exactly 1 mine in these adjacent cells. If (7,3) is a mine (flagged correctly), then that's the 1 mine, so all other adjacent cells are safe. So (6,2), (6,3), (8,2), (8,3) are safe. So if there are '?' cells adjacent to (7,2), they can be uncovered. But I don't see '?' in those positions.\n\nLooking at row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" — (6,8)=F. The cell (6,7)=1. (6,7) has adjacent cells: (5,6-8), (6,6-8), (7,6-8). (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2; (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F; (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. So (6,7)=1's adjacent cells include (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,8)=F, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. If (6,8) is a mine, then that's 1 mine, so the others are safe. So (5,7), (5,8), (7,7), (7,8) are safe.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells. For example, row 0 has \"1 1 1 ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" — columns 3 and 4 are '?'. Let's check the cell (0,3). What's the number of adjacent cells that are uncovered. (0,3) is '?', so let's look at the cells around it. The cell (0,2)=1. (0,2) is 1, so it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (0,2) are (0-1,1-3) [invalid row -1], (0,1-3), (1,1-3). So (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=?; (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?. So (0,2)=1 has adjacent cells: (0,1)=1 (number), (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2 (number), (1,3)=?. The 1 at (0,2) means exactly 1 mine in these cells. But we don't know enough here.\n\nLooking at row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" — (2,4)=1. (2,4)=1 has adjacent cells. Let's list (2,4) as (row 2, column 4). Adjacent cells are (1,3-5), (2,3-5), (3,3-5). (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1; (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0; (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. (2,5)=0, which means all adjacent cells are safe. So (2,5)=0 implies (1,4-6), (2,4-6), (3,4-6) are safe. (1,4)=2 (number), (1,5)=1 (number), (1,6)=0 (number); (2,4)=1 (number), (2,5)=0 (number), (2,6)=0 (number); (3,4)=1 (number), (3,5)=0 (number), (3,6)=0 (number). So (2,5)=0's adjacent cells are all safe, so any '?' near (2,5) can be uncovered. For example, (2,3) is '?', but (2,4)=1. Let's check (2,4)=1. Its adjacent cells include (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1; (2,3)=?, (2,5)=0; (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0. Since (2,5)=0, (1,5)=1, (3,5)=0 are safe. So (2,4)=1's adjacent mines must be in (1,3) and\/or (2,3) and\/or (3,3). (3,3)=1 (number, not a mine). So (1,3) and (2,3) could be mines. But (2,2)=3. Let's check (2,2)=3. (2,2) is 3, so it has 3 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells: (1,1-3), (2,1-3), (3,1-3). (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?; (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?; (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. So (2,2)=3's adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2)=2, (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. The 3 here means 3 mines in these 8 cells. (1,2)=2, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1 are numbers, so they are safe. So the possible mines are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). That's 5 cells, need 3 mines. Not sure yet.\n\nLet's look for a 0 cell that has adjacent '?'. For example, row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" — (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. (3,5)=0 implies adjacent cells are safe. Adjacent cells: (2,4-6), (3,4-6), (4,4-6). (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0; (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All these are numbers, so no '?' here. (3,6)=0: adjacent cells (2,5-7), (3,5-7), (4,5-7). (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0; (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0; (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. All uncovered. (3,7)=0: adjacent cells (2,6-8), (3,6-8), (4,6-8). (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0; (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1; (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (8,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (7,1-3), (8,1-3), (9,1-3). (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F; (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1; (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1. (7,3)=F is a flagged mine. (8,2)=1's adjacent cells include (7,3)=F, so if that's a mine, then (8,2)=1 has 1 mine, so the other adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" — (10,3)=? (assuming row 10 is part of the 9x9, which it shouldn't be, but perhaps the board is misformatted). Let's ignore rows beyond 8 if it's 9x9. Let's assume the board is 9 rows (0-8) and 9 columns (0-8). So let's re-express the board correctly.\n\nAssuming 9 rows (0-8) and 9 columns (0-8):\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, 1, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 1: [?, ?, 2, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 2: [?, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [?, ?, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, F]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThat makes more sense. Now, columns 0-8, rows 0-8. Let's re-express the board this way.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' in this 9x9 grid. The '?' are in:\n\nRow 0, columns 3,4.\n\nRow 1, columns 0,1,3.\n\nRow 2, columns 0,1,3.\n\nRow 3, columns 0,1.\n\nRow 4, column 8 is 1, no '?'.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-7 are numbers, column 8 is 2.\n\nRow 6, column 8 is F.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is F.\n\nRow 8, all numbers.\n\nSo the '?' cells are:\n\n(0,3), (0,4)\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,3)\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,3)\n\n(3,0), (3,1)\n\nNow, let's analyze these cells.\n\nFirst, let's check 0 cells. For example, row 0, column 6 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0-1,5-7) [invalid row -1], (0,5-7), (1,5-7). (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0; (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. Since (0,6)=0, all adjacent cells are safe. So (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0 are safe, which they are (already uncovered).\n\nRow 2, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (1,4-6), (2,4-6), (3,4-6). (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0; (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0. All these are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (2,4-6), (3,4-6), (4,4-6). (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0; (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0; (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, columns 3-7 are 0. For example, (4,3)=0. Adjacent cells: (3,2-4), (4,2-4), (5,2-4). (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1; (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0; (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at a cell with a number that has adjacent '?' and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines.\n\nTake row 1, column 2: (1,2)=2. Let's find its adjacent cells. (1,2) is at row 1, column 2. Adjacent cells are (0,1-3), (1,1-3), (2,1-3). So:\n\n(0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=?\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?\n\n(2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?\n\nSo (1,2)=2 has 8 adjacent cells: (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=?.\n\nThe 2 here means there are 2 mines in these 5 '?' cells (since (0,1), (0,2), (2,2) are safe). So 2 mines among (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nNow, look at row 2, column 2: (2,2)=3. Adjacent cells are (1,1-3), (2,1-3), (3,1-3). So:\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?\n\n(2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?\n\n(3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\nSo (2,2)=3's adjacent cells: (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nFrom (1,2)=2, we know there are 2 mines in (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Let's call these set A.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3, 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) — set B.\n\nThe intersection of A and B is (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Let's call this set C.\n\nSo (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in set C plus (0,3). (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in set C plus (3,1).\n\nLet's denote:\n\nLet x = number of mines in set C.\n\nThen, from (1,2)=2: x + (0,3 is mine? 1 or 0) = 2.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: x + (3,1 is mine? 1 or 0) = 3.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: (0,3) is a mine (1), then x=1. Then from (2,2)=3: x + (3,1) =3 → 1 + (3,1)=3 → (3,1)=2. Impossible, since a cell can't be 2 mines.\n\nCase 2: (0,3) is not a mine (0), then x=2. Then from (2,2)=3: 2 + (3,1)=3 → (3,1)=1. So (3,1) is a mine.\n\nSo this suggests that (0,3) is safe (not a mine), and (3,1) is a mine. Also, x=2, meaning 2 mines in set C: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nIf (0,3) is safe, then we can uncover (0,3). Let's verify this.\n\nIf (0,3) is safe, then uncovering it would show the number of adjacent mines. Let's check (0,3)'s adjacent cells. (0,3) is at row 0, column 3. Adjacent cells are (0-1,2-4) [invalid row -1], (0,2-4), (1,2-4). So:\n\n(0,2)=1, (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?\n\n(1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2.\n\nSo (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2.\n\nIf (0,3) is safe, uncovering it would show the count of mines in these adjacent cells. But since we deduced (0,3) is safe, this is a good candidate to uncover.\n\nAnother angle: Let's look at row 3, column 2: (3,2)=2. Adjacent cells are (2,1-3), (3,1-3), (4,1-3). So:\n\n(2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?\n\n(3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\n(4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0.\n\nSo (3,2)=2's adjacent cells: (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,3)=0 (safe). So mines could be in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nIf (3,1) is a mine (from earlier deduction), then (3,2)=2 has 1 mine (3,1), so there must be 1 more mine in (2,1) or (2,3).\n\nBut from (2,2)=3, which has 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). If (3,1) is a mine, then the remaining 2 mines are in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nThis is getting a bit complex, but the key deduction was that (0,3) is safe. Let's confirm:\n\nFrom (1,2)=2: 2 mines in (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nIf (0,3) were a mine, then (1,2)=2 would require 1 more mine in the other four cells. Then (2,2)=3 would need 3 mines in its five cells, which would include (3,1) as a mine (since 3 mines minus the 1 from (0,3) is not directly related). But the earlier case where (0,3) is not a mine leads to a possible scenario where (3,1) is a mine. Since (0,3) is a '?', and we think it's safe, uncovering it would be a good move.\n\nAnother possible safe cell: Let's check row 0, column 4: (0,4)=?. Its adjacent cells are (0,3)=?, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=1; (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1. (0,5)=1 is safe, (1,4)=2 is safe, (1,5)=1 is safe. So (0,4) is adjacent to (0,3)=?, (1,3)=?, and others safe. If (0,3) is safe (as we thought), then (0,4) might be safe too, but let's focus on (0,3) first.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell with a 0 that has adjacent '?'. For example, row 4, column 7 is 0. (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells are (3,6-8), (4,6-8), (5,6-8). (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1; (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1; (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All these are uncovered, so no '?' here.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 0. (5,6)=0. Adjacent cells: (4,5-7), (5,5-7), (6,5-7). (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0; (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1; (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 6 is 0. (6,6)=0. Adjacent cells: (5,5-7), (6,5-7), (7,5-7). (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1; (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1; (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 6 is 0. (7,6)=0. Adjacent cells: (6,5-7), (7,5-7), (8,5-7). (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1; (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1; (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is 0. (8,5)=0. Adjacent cells: (7,4-6), (8,4-6), (9,4-6) [row 9 is invalid]. (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0; (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo no 0 cells with adjacent '?'. The next best move is to uncover a '?' that we deduced is safe, like (0,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,3)","uncover (0,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state. The user provided the current board, which is a 13x9 grid? Wait, no, looking at the input, the board is listed as rows, each row's cells separated by spaces. Let me check the dimensions. The first row has 10 elements, but maybe it's a typo. Wait, the Minesweeper rules say it's a 9x9 grid, but the current board shown here has 13 rows. That might be a formatting error, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Let's assume that the board is correctly presented, maybe each line is a row, and the numbers are the cells.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.2, which means 2 out of 10 mines are correctly flagged (since 2\/10=0.2). The flags are 2\/10, so there are 2 F's on the board, and unflags are 0. Let's look at the board to find where the F's are.\n\nLooking at the rows:\n\nRow 6 (0-based index 6): ... 1 F 1 0 0 0 → so (6,8) is F.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 → (7,3) is F.\n\nSo there are two F's. The user needs to flag all 10 mines, but currently only 2 are correct. Alternatively, uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ total mines.\n\nNow, the task is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. Let's analyze the board to find safe cells to uncover or mines to flag.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in Minesweeper, a numbered cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Unknown cells are '?', flagged are 'F'.\n\nLet's look for cells with numbers and adjacent '?' to see if we can deduce mines or safe cells.\n\nStarting with row 0: \"1 1 1 1 ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\"\n\nAssuming row 0 has columns 0 to 12 (since there are 13 elements), but maybe the original 9x9 is part of a larger display. Maybe the board is presented with some rows extended, but perhaps it's better to focus on the cells with numbers and '?'.\n\nLet's take row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\"\n\nThe cell at (4,9) is '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell (4,8) is 1, (4,10) is 1. Let's check the adjacent cells of (4,9):\n\nAdjacent cells would be (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), (4,8), (4,10), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10).\n\nLooking at row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" → (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2.\n\nRow 4: (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" → (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1.\n\nSo the cell (4,9) is adjacent to:\n\n(3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2,\n\n(4,8)=1, (4,10)=1,\n\n(5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1.\n\nThe number of adjacent cells that are numbers: all except maybe (3,9) which is 1. Wait, (3,9) is 1, which is a number. So all adjacent cells are uncovered except (4,9) itself. Wait, no: (4,9) is the '?', so its adjacent cells are the 8 around it. Let's list their values:\n\n(3,8) = 1 (from row 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" → index 8 is 1)\n\n(3,9) = 1 (index 9)\n\n(3,10) = 2 (index 10)\n\n(4,8) = 1 (row 4: index 8)\n\n(4,10) = 1 (index 10)\n\n(5,8) = 2 (row 5: index 8)\n\n(5,9) = 2 (index 9)\n\n(5,10) = 1 (index 10)\n\nSo all adjacent cells are numbers, which means (4,9) is a safe cell (since if it were a mine, the adjacent numbers would have to account for it, but since all adjacent cells are already uncovered and their numbers are fixed, (4,9) can't be a mine). Therefore, (4,9) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nAnother example: let's check row 0, column 4: \"1 1 1 1 ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" → (0,4) is '?'. Let's look at its adjacent cells. The cell (0,3) is 1, (0,5) is 1. The row above (if any) is none, since row 0 is top. Row 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" → (1,3) is '?', (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 1.\n\nAdjacent cells of (0,4):\n\n(0,3)=1, (0,5)=1,\n\n(1,3)=?, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1,\n\nand (0,4) has no row -1, so only the cells below and adjacent.\n\nThe cell (0,3) is 1. The 1 at (0,3) has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2. The 1 at (0,3) indicates there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. Since (0,2)=1 is a number (not a mine), (0,4) is '?', (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2 (number, not mine). So the 1 at (0,3) must have exactly 1 mine in (0,4), (1,2), (1,3).\n\nSimilarly, the cell (0,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,4)=?, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0. Since (0,6)=0 and (1,6)=0 are numbers (no mines), the 1 at (0,5) must have 1 mine in (0,4) and (1,4), (1,5). But (1,5)=1 is a number (not a mine), (1,4)=2 is a number (not a mine). So (0,5) has 1 mine in (0,4). Therefore, (0,4) must be a mine? Wait, no. Because (0,5) is 1, which counts mines in adjacent cells. (0,5) is at (row 0, col 5). Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1): invalid (row -1)\n\n(row-1, col): invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1): invalid\n\n(row, col-1): (0,4) → '?'\n\n(row, col+1): (0,6) → 0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1): (1,4) → 2 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col): (1,5) → 1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1): (1,6) → 0 (safe)\n\nSo the only adjacent cell that could be a mine is (0,4). Since (0,5) is 1, that means (0,4) must be a mine. Because the 1 indicates exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells, and the only adjacent cell that's unknown is (0,4). Therefore, (0,4) is a mine. So we should flag (0,4).\n\nWait, let's confirm. (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0 are all safe (they are numbers, not mines). So the only possible mine adjacent to (0,5) is (0,4). Since (0,5) is 1, (0,4) must be a mine. Therefore, (0,4) should be flagged.\n\nAnother check: (0,3) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,4)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2. The 1 at (0,3) needs exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If (0,4) is a mine (as per (0,5)'s 1), then (0,3)'s 1 would have that mine. So (0,3)'s 1 is satisfied by (0,4) being a mine, meaning the other adjacent cells (1,2), (1,3) are safe. That could be possible.\n\nSo (0,4) is a mine. Let's check another cell. Row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,3) is '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1. Row 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1. Row 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1.\n\nAdjacent cells of (10,3):\n\n(9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1,\n\n(10,2)=1, (10,4)=1,\n\n(11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1.\n\nAll these are numbers (safe), so (10,3) is a safe cell. Uncovering it would be safe.\n\nBut let's go back to (0,4). If (0,4) is a mine, then flagging it would increase the correct flags from 2 to 3, improving the score. Let's verify again. (0,5) is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,4) is '?', (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0. All the latter are numbers, so they can't be mines. Therefore, the only possible mine adjacent to (0,5) is (0,4). Since (0,5) is 1, (0,4) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (0,4).\n\nAnother possible cell: row 0, column 9: \"1 ? ? ? ?\" → (0,9) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. (0,8)=1, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. (0,8) is 1, which has adjacent cells including (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. The 1 at (0,8) indicates 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,7)=0, (1,7)=0 are safe. (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1 are numbers (safe). So the only possible mine is (0,9). Therefore, (0,9) is a mine. So we should flag (0,9).\n\nWait, (0,8) is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1): invalid\n\n(row-1, col): invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1): invalid\n\n(row, col-1): (0,7)=0 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1): (0,9)=?\n\n(row+1, col-1): (1,7)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col): (1,8)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1): (1,9)=1 (safe)\n\nSo the only adjacent unknown cell is (0,9). Since (0,8) is 1, (0,9) must be a mine. Therefore, (0,9) is a mine and should be flagged.\n\nSo now, we have two possible mines: (0,4) and (0,9). Let's check if these are correct.\n\nIf we flag (0,4) and (0,9), that would bring the correct flags to 4 (since current is 2). But we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the F's already present. (6,8) and (7,3) are F. Are these correct?\n\nFor (6,8): row 6 is \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\". The cell (6,8) is F. Let's check the adjacent cell (6,7)=1, (6,9)=1, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1.\n\nThe cell (6,7) is 1. Its adjacent cells include (6,8)=F. So (6,7)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells, which would be (6,8) if it's a mine. That's possible. Similarly, (5,8)=2: adjacent cells include (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. So (5,8)=2. If (6,8) is a mine, then (5,8) has that mine plus another. Let's see: (5,8)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?,\n\n(5,7)=1, (5,9)=2,\n\n(6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1.\n\nAssuming (6,8) is a mine, then (5,8) would have 1 mine (from (6,8)) and needs one more. (4,9) is '?', which could be a mine. But (4,9) we thought earlier might be safe. Maybe (6,8) is a correct flag.\n\n(7,3) is F: row 7 is \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\". The cell (7,3) is F. Let's check (7,2)=1. (7,2)=1's adjacent cells: (7,1)=0, (7,3)=F, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1. So (7,2)=1 has 1 mine, which would be (7,3) if it's a mine. That's possible. (7,4)=1: adjacent cells (7,3)=F, (7,5)=0, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0. So (7,4)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (7,3). So (7,3) is likely a correct flag.\n\nSo the existing F's are probably correct. Now, back to (0,4) and (0,9). Let's confirm (0,5)=1. (0,5) is at (0,5). Its adjacent cells are (0,4), (0,6), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6). (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0 are all safe (numbers), so only (0,4) could be a mine. Therefore, (0,4) is a mine. So flagging (0,4) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (0,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. All except (0,9) are safe, so (0,9) must be a mine. So flagging (0,9) is correct.\n\nSo the best action now is to flag one of these. Let's pick (0,4) first. So the action would be 'flag (0,4)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (0,4)","flag (0,4)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the rules. The board is 9x9 but the given current board has 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting error, but maybe it's a typo. Let's focus on the input.\n\nThe user provided the current board, which is a grid of cells. The cells can be '?', numbers, 'F', etc. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is 0.3, which means 3 out of 10 flags are correct (since Flags: 3\/10). So there are 3 correct flags and 7 incorrect ones (since total flags are 3, but 10 mines exist).\n\nFirst, let's parse the current board. Let's list out the cells with their coordinates. The top-left is (0,0). Let's assume each row is a line, so row 0 is the first line, row 1 the second, etc. Each line's columns are 0 to 8 (since it's 9x9). Wait, the given board lines have varying lengths. For example, the first line is \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" which has 13 elements, but that can't be right. Maybe it's a formatting mistake, and the actual board is 9x9, so each row should have 9 cells. Perhaps the user made a mistake in pasting the board, but let's try to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the board is presented with some rows split, but that's unclear. Let's try to focus on the cells that are visible. Let's look for cells that are 'F' (flagged) and see if they might be correct or incorrect. The current flags are 3\/10, so 3 are correct, 0 unflags (so all flags are still there).\n\nLooking at the board lines:\n\nRow 0: ... F ... (column 4, since \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1\" — positions 0-8: 0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:F,5:1,6:0,7:0,8:1)\nRow 6: ... F ... (maybe column 8? \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" — positions 0-8: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:1,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:1,8:F)\nRow 7: ... F ... (column 3: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" — positions 0-8: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:F,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:1,8:1)\n\nSo there are three F's at (0,4), (6,8), (7,3). The score is 3\/10, so these three are correct mines. That means the other 7 mines are not flagged yet.\n\nNow, the goal is to either flag all 10 mines or uncover all safe cells. Since there are 10 mines, and 3 are correctly flagged, we need to flag 7 more. Alternatively, uncover all safe cells (which are 81-10=71 cells). The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nWe need to decide whether to uncover a safe cell or flag a mine. Let's look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines.\n\nLet's look at cells that are numbered, which indicate the number of adjacent mines. For example, a cell with '0' means all 8 adjacent cells are safe. So if we see a 0, we can uncover all adjacent '?' cells because they are safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0. Let's check their adjacent cells. The 0 at (0,6) has adjacent cells: (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. Wait, maybe better to list coordinates and their values.\n\nLet's take row 0: columns 0-8 are [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1]. So (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1.\n\nA 0 in Minesweeper means no mines in any of the 8 surrounding cells. So (0,6) is 0. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,5): 1 (already uncovered)\n(0,7): 0 (uncovered)\n(1,5): 1 (from row 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 ...\" so (1,5)=1)\n(1,6): 0 (row 1, column 6 is 0)\n(1,7): 0 (row 1, column 7 is 0)\n(-1,5): invalid (row -1)\n(-1,6): invalid\n(-1,7): invalid\n\nSo (0,6) is 0, so all adjacent cells (which are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7)) are safe. But those are already uncovered. What about (0,7)=0. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,6)=0 (uncovered)\n(0,8)=1 (uncovered)\n(1,6)=0 (uncovered)\n(1,7)=0 (uncovered)\n(1,8)=1 (row 1, column 8 is 1)\n(-1,6): invalid\n(-1,7): invalid\n(-1,8): invalid\n\nSo (0,7) being 0 also confirms adjacent cells are safe, which are already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 ...\" so (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" so (2,2)=3, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 ...\" so (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ...\" so (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 ...\" so (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F ...\" so (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F (flagged mine).\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 ...\" so (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F (flagged mine), (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 ...\" so (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells. These are unknown cells that haven't been uncovered or flagged. Let's find their coordinates.\n\nLooking at row 0: after \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1\" there are \"? ? ? ?\" — but assuming 9 columns, maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the board is 13x13? But the initial rule says 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the board. Let's assume it's 9x9, so each row has 9 cells. So row 0 has cells 0-8: [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1]. So no '?' in row 0.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1\" — so columns 0,1,3 are '?'. So (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\" — columns 0,1,3 are '?'. So (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?.\n\nRow 3: \"? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\" — columns 0,1 are '?'. So (3,0)=?, (3,1)=?.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\" — no '?'.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\" — no '?'.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F\" — no '?'.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1\" — no '?'.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\" — no '?'.\n\nSo the '?' cells are in rows 1, 2, 3. Let's list them:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1).\n\nNow, let's analyze these cells to see if they can be determined as safe or mines.\n\nLet's start with (1,2)=2. That cell has a value of 2, meaning there are 2 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (1,2):\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nWe know the values of some of these:\n\n(0,1)=1 (row 0, column 1), (0,2)=1 (row 0, column 2), (0,3)=1 (row 0, column 3), (2,2)=3 (row 2, column 2), (2,1)=? (row 2, column 1), (1,1)=? (row 1, column 1), (1,3)=? (row 1, column 3), (2,3)=? (row 2, column 3).\n\nWait, (1,2)=2. So among its 8 adjacent cells, 2 are mines. Let's check which of these adjacent cells are already known. (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are all uncovered (value 1), so they are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). (2,2)=3 is uncovered, so safe. So the remaining adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). These are the '?' cells. So (1,2)=2 implies that exactly 2 of (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) are mines.\n\nNext, (2,2)=3. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nWe know (1,2)=2 (safe), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So the adjacent cells that are unknown are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). So (2,2)=3 means there are 3 mines among these 5 cells.\n\nFrom (1,2)=2: 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Let's call this set A: { (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) }, with 2 mines.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: 3 mines in set B: A ∪ { (3,1) }, which is 5 cells. So set B has 3 mines. Since set A has 2, then (3,1) must be a mine (because 2 + 1 = 3). So (3,1) is a mine.\n\nIf (3,1) is a mine, then let's check another cell that might confirm this. Let's look at (3,2)=2. (3,2) is at row 3, column 2, value 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\nWe know (2,2)=3 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe), (4,2)=1 (safe), (4,3)=0 (safe). So the adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3). (3,3) is safe (value 1), so (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) are the unknowns. (3,2)=2 means there are 2 mines in these 3 cells. We already deduced (3,1) is a mine (from (2,2)=3), so that leaves 1 mine in (2,1) or (2,3).\n\nGoing back to (1,2)=2, which has 2 mines in set A: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). If (3,1) is a mine, then (2,2)=3's 3 mines are 2 from set A plus (3,1). So set A has 2 mines.\n\nLet's look at (2,3)=? Let's check (2,4)=1. (2,4) is row 2, column 4, value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nWe know (1,4)=2 (row 1, column 4), (1,5)=1 (row 1, column 5), (2,5)=0 (row 2, column 5), (3,3)=1 (row 3, column 3), (3,4)=1 (row 3, column 4), (3,5)=0 (row 3, column 5). So (2,4)=1's adjacent cells are (1,3), (2,3). The others are safe (since they are numbers). So (2,4)=1 implies that there is 1 mine in (1,3) and (2,3).\n\nSo (2,4)=1: 1 mine in (1,3) and (2,3). Let's denote this as equation (1): (1,3) + (2,3) = 1.\n\nFrom (1,2)=2: 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Let's denote this as equation (2): (1,1) + (1,3) + (2,1) + (2,3) = 2.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: (1,1) + (1,3) + (2,1) + (2,3) + (3,1) = 3. Since (3,1) is a mine (1), then equation (2) + (3,1) = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches (2,2)=3. So that holds.\n\nFrom (3,2)=2: (2,1) + (2,3) + (3,1) = 2. Since (3,1)=1, then (2,1) + (2,3) = 1. Let's call this equation (3).\n\nFrom equation (1): (1,3) + (2,3) = 1. Let's say (2,3) = x, then (1,3) = 1 - x.\n\nFrom equation (3): (2,1) + x = 1 → (2,1) = 1 - x.\n\nFrom equation (2): (1,1) + (1 - x) + (1 - x) + x = 2 → (1,1) + 1 - x + 1 - x + x = 2 → (1,1) + 2 - x = 2 → (1,1) = x.\n\nSo (1,1) = x, (2,1) = 1 - x, (1,3) = 1 - x, (2,3) = x, where x is 0 or 1 (since it's a mine or not).\n\nNow, let's check (1,4)=2. (1,4) is row 1, column 4, value 2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\nWe know (0,3)=1 (safe), (0,4)=F (flagged mine, which is correct as per score), (0,5)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe). So the adjacent cells are (1,3), (2,3), and (0,4)=F (mine). (0,4) is a mine, so that's 1 mine. (1,4)=2 means total 2 mines in adjacent cells, so (1,3) + (2,3) must be 1 (since 1 + 1 = 2). Which matches equation (1). So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's look at (1,0)=? and (2,0)=?, (3,0)=?.\n\nLet's check (4,0)=1. (4,0) is row 4, column 0, value 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,0), (5,1).\n\nWe know (4,1)=1 (safe), (5,0)=0 (safe), (5,1)=0 (safe). So the adjacent cells are (3,0) and (3,1). (3,1) we deduced is a mine. So (4,0)=1 implies that there is 1 mine in (3,0) and (3,1). Since (3,1) is a mine (1), then (3,0) must be safe (0). So (3,0) is safe.\n\nSo (3,0) can be uncovered safely. That's a good candidate for an action.\n\nLet's confirm: (4,0)=1. Adjacent cells are (3,0), (3,1), (4,1)=1, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0. The mines in adjacent cells: (3,1) is a mine. So total mines here is 1, which matches (4,0)=1. Therefore, (3,0) is safe (no mine), so uncovering (3,0) is safe.\n\nAnother cell to check: (3,0) is in row 3, column 0, which is a '?'. Since we determined it's safe, we can uncover it. That would be a safe move.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next in this Minesweeper game. First, I need to understand the current board state and the rules. The board is a 9x9 grid, but looking at the input, the current board has 13 rows and 13 columns? Wait, maybe the user made a typo, but the problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid. Hmm, maybe the current board is displayed with some rows and columns, but perhaps it's a larger view. Let me focus on the given data.\n\nThe score is 0.3, which means 3 out of 10 mines are correctly flagged (Flags: 3\/10). The unflags are 0, so all flags are still there. The board has cells with numbers, F (flags), and ? (unknown). The goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nFirst, let's recall that in Minesweeper, a number in a cell indicates the number of mines in the 8 adjacent cells. Flags (F) are user-placed markers for suspected mines. Uncovering a mine ends the game, so we need to avoid that.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's list out the cells and their states. Let's index rows from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows in the current board display) and columns 0 to 12. Wait, but the original game is 9x9, maybe the display is a larger view? Maybe the user input has a mistake, but I have to work with what's given.\n\nLet's parse the current board row by row:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\nColumns 0-12: [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1,?, ?, ?, ?]\n\nRow 1: ? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: ? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: 1 ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nFirst, let's check the existing flags. There are two F's in the current board: one at (0,4) and one at (6,8), and one at (7,3). Wait, let's count:\n\nRow 0, column 4: F → (0,4)\nRow 6, column 8: F → (6,8)\nRow 7, column 3: F → (7,3)\nSo that's 3 flags, which matches the \"Flags: 3\/10\" statement. So these are the current flagged cells.\n\nNow, the goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. Since we have 3 flags, we need to find more mines or uncover safe cells.\n\nLet's look for cells that are safe to uncover. Safe cells are those that are not mines, and their adjacent numbers can help us determine that.\n\nLet's start with cells that have 0, because 0 means no adjacent mines, so all adjacent cells are safe and can be uncovered. For example, in row 0, columns 6 and 7 are 0. The adjacent cells to (0,6) (which is 0) would be cells around it: (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). But (0,5) is 1, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. Since (0,6) is 0, all 8 adjacent cells have 0 mines. So any unknown cells adjacent to 0 can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 8 is 1. The cell (0,8) has value 1, so it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. Let's check its neighbors: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. So the 1 in (0,8) must have a mine in one of its adjacent cells. But maybe not immediately helpful.\n\nRow 1, column 6 and 7 are 0. So (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. Their adjacent cells would be safe. For (1,6), adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All these are known, so maybe no unknowns here. (1,7) is 0, adjacent cells include (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. So (2,8) is 0, which is already known.\n\nRow 2, columns 5-8 are 0. (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. The 0s here mean their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (2,6)=0: adjacent cells (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. All known, so no unknowns here.\n\nRow 3, columns 5-7 are 0: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (3,5)=0: adjacent cells (2,4)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All known. (3,6)=0: adjacent cells (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,7)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. All known. (3,7)=0: adjacent cells (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. (3,8)=1 is known, (4,8)=1 is known.\n\nRow 4, columns 3-7 are 0: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. These 0s mean adjacent cells are safe. For example, (4,3)=0: adjacent cells (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All known. (4,4)=0: adjacent cells (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,5)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0. All known.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-6 are 0: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. These 0s mean adjacent cells are safe. For example, (5,6)=0: adjacent cells (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1. (5,7)=1 is known, (6,7)=1 is known.\n\nRow 6, columns 0-5 are 0: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0. (6,5)=0: adjacent cells (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All known.\n\nRow 7, columns 0-2 are 0: (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1. (7,2)=1: adjacent cells (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. (7,3) is flagged as F, which is a suspected mine. The 1 in (7,2) has adjacent cells: (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,3)=F. If (7,3) is a mine, then the 1 in (7,2) would have exactly 1 mine (since (6,2) and (6,3) are 1, which are numbers, not mines). So that checks out if (7,3) is a mine.\n\nRow 8, columns 0-2 are 0: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1. (8,2)=1: adjacent cells (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1. (7,3) is F, so if that's a mine, then (8,2) has 1 mine adjacent, which matches the 1.\n\nRow 9, columns 0-2 are 0: (9,0)=0, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1. (9,2)=1: adjacent cells (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?. (10,3) is unknown (marked as ?). The 1 in (9,2) has adjacent cells: (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?. The count here: the current known adjacent cells (8,2)=1 (number, not mine), (8,3)=1 (number), (9,3)=1 (number), (10,2)=1 (number). So the 1 in (9,2) must have 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The only unknown is (10,3). So if (10,3) is a mine, then (9,2) would have 1 mine, which matches. But we can't be sure yet.\n\nRow 10, column 3 is ?: (10,3). Let's check its adjacent cells. (10,3) is in row 10, column 3. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1,\n\n(10,2)=1, (10,4)=1,\n\n(11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1.\n\nSo all adjacent cells to (10,3) are 1s. Each of these 1s (e.g., (9,2)=1) has (10,3) as an adjacent cell. Let's take (9,2)=1: its adjacent cells are (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?. So (9,2) has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The possible mine is (10,3), because the other adjacent cells are numbers (so not mines) or 0s (so not mines). So if (10,3) is a mine, then (9,2)=1 is satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, (10,2)=1: adjacent cells are (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. So (10,2)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(11,2)=1: adjacent cells (10,1)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,3)=1, (12,1)=0, (12,2)=0, (12,3)=0. So (11,2)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(9,3)=1: adjacent cells (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,4)=1, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?, (10,4)=1. So (9,3)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(10,4)=1: adjacent cells (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,3)=?, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0. So (10,4)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(11,3)=1: adjacent cells (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?, (10,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,4)=1, (12,2)=0, (12,3)=0, (12,4)=0. So (11,3)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(11,4)=1: adjacent cells (10,3)=?, (10,4)=1, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,5)=0, (12,3)=0, (12,4)=0, (12,5)=0. So (11,4)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\n(9,4)=1: adjacent cells (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (9,3)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,3)=?, (10,4)=1, (10,5)=0. So (9,4)=1 has 1 mine, which could be (10,3).\n\nSo all 8 adjacent cells to (10,3) are 1s, each of which would have exactly 1 mine if (10,3) is a mine. That makes (10,3) a likely mine. But we need to check if there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells marked as ? that are adjacent to 0s, because 0s mean all adjacent cells are safe. For example, in row 0, columns 9-12 are ?. Let's check row 0, column 8 is 1. The cell (0,8)=1. Its adjacent cells include (0,9)=?. Let's see (0,8) has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. So (0,8) has 1 mine. The possible mine could be (0,9) or (1,9) or (1,8). But (1,8)=1 is a number, so not a mine. (1,9)=1 is a number, not a mine. So (0,9) could be the mine. But that's a guess.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are ? and adjacent to 0s. For example, row 4, column 9 is ? (row 4: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,?,1,0,0]). So (4,9) is ?. Let's check its adjacent cells. (4,9) is in row 4, column 9. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2,\n\n(4,8)=1, (4,10)=1,\n\n(5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1.\n\nSo (4,9) is adjacent to cells with numbers. Let's see (5,8)=2: adjacent cells include (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. (5,8)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (4,8)=1 (number), (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1 (number), (5,9)=2 (number), (6,7)=1 (number), (6,8)=F (suspected mine), (6,9)=1 (number). So if (6,8) is a mine, then (5,8) needs 1 more mine. That could be (4,9). But (6,8) is flagged as F, which is one of the 3 flags. If (6,8) is a correct flag (mine), then (5,8)=2 would have 1 mine (from (6,8)) and needs another, possibly (4,9).\n\nAlternatively, (5,9)=2: adjacent cells (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. (5,9)=2 has 2 mines. If (6,8) is a mine, then another mine could be (4,9). So (4,9) might be a mine, but not sure.\n\nLet's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0s. Let's find 0s and see their adjacent ? cells.\n\nLooking at row 5, column 7 is 1: (5,7)=1. Adjacent cells include (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. (5,7)=1 has 1 mine. The adjacent cells: (4,8)=1 (number), (5,8)=2 (number), (6,7)=1 (number), (6,8)=F (suspected mine). So if (6,8) is a mine, then (5,7)=1 is satisfied. That's possible.\n\nAnother 0 is row 8, columns 7-12: (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0, etc. Let's check row 8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So (8,7)=0. Adjacent cells: (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,8)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=0. All known, so no ? here.\n\nRow 12 is all 0s, so no ?.\n\nRow 10, column 3 is ?, as we discussed earlier. Let's check another area. Row 3, column 1 is ? (row 3: [1,?,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,2,1,1]). So (3,1) is ?. Let's check its adjacent cells. (3,1) is in row 3, column 1. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3,\n\n(3,0)=1, (3,2)=2,\n\n(4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\nSo (3,1) is adjacent to (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (3,0)=1, (3,2)=2, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1.\n\nThe cell (2,2)=3: adjacent cells include (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,2):\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,2)=2 (number), (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,2)=2 (number), (3,3)=1 (number).\n\nSo (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines among (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nThe cell (1,2)=2: adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?. (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. So (1,2)=2's adjacent mines are among (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nThe cell (3,2)=2: adjacent cells are (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=?, (3,3)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0. (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in adjacent cells. So (3,2)=2's adjacent mines are among (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nLet's denote variables for the unknowns around (2,2):\n\nLet A = (1,1), B = (1,3), C = (2,1), D = (2,3), E = (3,1). All are ? (unknown, could be mine or safe).\n\n(2,2)=3 → A + B + C + D + E = 3 (since the other adjacent cells are numbers, not mines).\n\n(1,2)=2 → A + B + C + D = 2 (since (2,2)=3 is a number, not a mine, and (0,1)=1, etc., are numbers).\n\n(3,2)=2 → C + D + E = 2.\n\nFrom (1,2)=2: A + B + C + D = 2.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: (A + B + C + D) + E = 3 → 2 + E = 3 → E = 1. So E (which is (3,1)) must be a mine.\n\nAh! That's a key insight. Let's verify:\n\n(2,2)=3 requires 3 mines in A, B, C, D, E.\n\n(1,2)=2 requires 2 mines in A, B, C, D.\n\nSo substituting, 2 (from A+B+C+D) + E = 3 → E=1. So E (3,1) is a mine.\n\nTherefore, (3,1) is a mine. But wait, if (3,1) is a mine, then we should flag it. But the current action could be to flag it, but let's check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let's confirm again. The cell (2,2) is 3, which means 3 mines in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Among these, (1,2)=2 (number, not mine), (3,2)=2 (number, not mine), (3,3)=1 (number, not mine). So the mines must be in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). That's 5 cells. So (2,2)=3 → 3 mines in these 5.\n\n(1,2)=2: its adjacent cells are (0,1)=1 (number), (0,2)=1 (number), (0,3)=1 (number), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2)=3 (number), (2,3). So (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\n(3,2)=2: adjacent cells are (2,1), (2,2)=3 (number), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3)=1 (number), (4,1)=1 (number), (4,2)=1 (number), (4,3)=0 (number). So (3,2)=2 has 2 mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).\n\nSo:\n\nLet x = number of mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). From (1,2)=2, x=2.\n\nLet y = number of mines in (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). From (3,2)=2, y=2.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3, the total mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) is 3. Since x=2 (mines in first four), then the mine count is 2 + (mine in (3,1)) = 3 → (3,1) must be a mine (so 2 +1=3). Therefore, (3,1) is a mine.\n\nSo (3,1) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag it. But the current flags are 3\/10, so adding this would make 4. But wait, the user's action could be to flag (3,1). But let's check if there's a cell that is definitely safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are safe. For example, in row 3, column 1 is a mine (as per above), but what about other cells. Let's check (3,1) is a mine, so we should flag it. But maybe there's a cell that is safe to uncover.\n\nWait, let's think again. The cell (3,1) is a mine, so if we flag it, that's a correct flag. But maybe there's a cell that is safe, like (1,1). Let's see:\n\nFrom (1,2)=2, which has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). And (2,2)=3 has 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Since (3,1) is a mine, then (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) have 2 mines. So (1,1) could be safe or a mine.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0, column 6 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All known, no ?.\n\nRow 1, column 6 is 0: adjacent cells (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All known.\n\nRow 2, column 6 is 0: adjacent cells (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=1, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. All known.\n\nRow 3, column 5 is 0: adjacent cells (2,4)=1, (2,5)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All known.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 0: adjacent cells (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All known.\n\nRow 5, column 0 is 0: adjacent cells (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1. All known.\n\nSo all 0s have their adjacent cells already uncovered. Therefore, the remaining ? cells are not adjacent to 0s, so we need to use the numbers to deduce.\n\nLet's go back to (3,1). We deduced it's a mine. So we should flag (3,1). But let's confirm.\n\nIf (3,1) is a mine, then (3,2)=2's adjacent mines are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Since (3,1) is a mine, then (2,1) and (2,3) must have 1 mine between them (because 2 total mines for (3,2)=2). So (2,1) + (2,3) = 1.\n\nFrom (1,2)=2: (1,1) + (1,3) + (2,1) + (2,3) = 2. Since (2,1)+(2,3)=1, then (1,1)+(1,3)=1.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3: (1,1)+(1,3)+(2,1)+(2,3)+(3,1)=3. Since (1,1)+(1,3)=1, (2,1)+(2,3)=1, and (3,1)=1, total is 1+1+1=3, which matches. So this holds.\n\nTherefore, (3,1) is indeed a mine. So the correct action would be to flag (3,1). But let's check the current flags: 3 flags, so adding this would make 4. But maybe there's a cell that is safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, (1,1) is adjacent to (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3. (1,1) is ?. But we can't be sure if it's safe.\n\nAnother approach: the game ends at 100 epochs, so we need to make moves until then. The score is correct flags \/ 10, so to maximize the score, we need to flag as many correct mines as possible. Since we deduced (3,1) is a mine, flagging it would increase the correct flags to 4 (assuming the existing 3 are correct). But we need to confirm if the existing flags are correct.\n\nThe existing flags are at (0,4), (6,8), (7,3). Let's check (0,4)=F. The cell (0,4) is in row 0, column 4. Let's check its adjacent cells. (0,4) is flagged as a mine. The cell (0,3)=1: adjacent cells include (0,4)=F. (0,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,3) adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=F, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2. So (0,3)=1 has 1 mine. If (0,4) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine, which matches. So (0,4) is likely a correct flag.\n\n(7,3)=F: cell (7,3) is flagged. Let's check (7,2)=1: adjacent cells (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. (7,2)=1 has 1 mine. If (7,3) is a mine, then that's the 1 mine, which matches. So (7,3) is likely a correct flag.\n\n(6,8)=F: cell (6,8) is flagged. Let's check (5,8)=2: adjacent cells (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. (5,8)=2 has 2 mines. If (6,8) is a mine, then there's 1 mine, so another mine could be (4,9). (5,9)=2: adjacent cells (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. (5,9)=2 has 2 mines. If (6,8) is a mine, then another mine could be (4,9). So (6,8) is likely a correct flag.\n\nSo the existing 3 flags are probably correct. Then (3,1) is a mine, so flagging it would make 4 correct flags.\n\nBut the question is, what action should we take now. The user can uncover, flag, or unflag. Since we need to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells, and we found a mine at (3,1), the action should be to flag it.\n\nWait, but let's make sure. The current board has (3,1) as ?, so we can flag it. The command would be 'flag (3,1)'.\n\nBut let's check if there's a cell that is safe to uncover. For example, let's look at (10,3)=?. Earlier, we thought it might be a mine, but maybe not. Alternatively, let's check (4,9)=?.\n\nRow 4, column 9 is ?. Its adjacent cells are (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (4,8)=1, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1.\n\n(5,8)=2: adjacent mines are (4,9) and (6,8)=F (if (6,8) is a mine). If (6,8) is a mine, then (5,8)=2 needs one more mine, which could be (4,9). (5,9)=2: adjacent mines could be (4,9) and (6,8)=F. So (4,9) is likely a mine. So (4,9) is a mine, but we need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (1,3)=?. Row 1, column 3 is ?. Its adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F, (1,2)=2, (1,4)=2, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1. (1,3)=? is adjacent to (0,4)=F (flagged mine). (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). If (1,3) is a mine, then that contributes to the count. But we can't be sure.\n\nGiven that we have a definite mine at (3,1), the best action is to flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (3,1)","flag (3,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current Minesweeper board. The board is 9x9, but the given current board seems to have more rows and columns. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but let's focus on the information provided.\n\nThe user's score is 0.4, which means they've correctly flagged 4 mines out of 10. The flags are 4\/10, so there are 4 F's on the board, but some might be incorrect. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list out the cells with their coordinates. The top-left is (0,0). Let's index rows from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows listed), and columns 0 to 12 (each row has 13 elements). Wait, but Minesweeper is typically 9x9. Maybe the user input has a formatting error, but I'll proceed with the given data.\n\nFirst, identify all the F's (flags) to check if they are correct. The current flags are:\n\n- Row 0, column 4: (0,4) is F\n- Row 3, column 1: (3,1) is F\n- Row 6, column 8: (6,8) is F\n- Row 7, column 3: (7,3) is F\n\nSo there are 4 flags. The score is 0.4, which is 4\/10, so these 4 are correct. So these F's are actual mines. Good.\n\nNow, we need to find safe cells to uncover or correctly flag more mines. Let's look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and see if we can deduce if they are safe or mines.\n\nLet's start with the first row: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\" So row 0, columns 0-12. Columns 0-8 are known, columns 9-12 are '?'. The cell (0,8) is 1. The adjacent cells to (0,8) are (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. The 1 at (0,8) means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,7)=0 (safe), (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe, since it's a number), (1,9)=1 (safe). So the only possible adjacent cell with a mine is (0,9). Wait, but (0,8) is 1, so 1 mine in 8 adjacent cells. Let's list all 8 adjacent cells for (0,8):\n\n(0,8) adjacent cells:\n- (0,7): 0 (safe)\n- (0,9): ? (unknown)\n- (1,7): 0 (safe)\n- (1,8): 1 (safe)\n- (1,9): 1 (safe)\n- (-1,7): invalid (row -1)\n- (-1,8): invalid\n- (-1,9): invalid\nSo only (0,9) is unknown. So (0,8) has 1 mine in adjacent, so (0,9) must be a mine? Wait, no. Because (0,8) is a number, which is the count of mines in its 8 adjacent cells. So if (0,8) is 1, then exactly one of its adjacent cells is a mine. The adjacent cells are (0,7), (0,9), (1,7), (1,8), (1,9), and the ones above (row -1, which don't exist). So (0,7) is 0 (safe), (1,7) is 0 (safe), (1,8) is 1 (safe, since it's a number, meaning it's uncovered and not a mine), (1,9) is 1 (same). So the only possible cell that could be a mine is (0,9). Therefore, (0,9) must be a mine. So we should flag (0,9).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. Let's look at row 0, column 5 is 1. Its adjacent cells: (0,4)=F (mine), (0,6)=0 (safe), (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0. So (0,5) is 1. The adjacent cells include (0,4)=F (mine), so that's 1 mine. So that's correct, so (0,5) is 1 because of the mine at (0,4). That checks out.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 ? 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" Let's take (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells: (0,1)=?, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?. The 2 at (1,2) means 2 mines in adjacent cells. (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (2,2)=3 (safe). So possible mines are (0,1), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). Not sure yet.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" (2,2)=3. Adjacent cells: (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=F (mine), (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. The 3 at (2,2) should have 3 mines. We know (3,1)=F (mine) is adjacent. So that's 1 mine. So there are 2 more mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). (1,2)=2 is safe, (3,2)=2 is safe, (3,3)=1 is safe.\n\nRow 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" (3,0)=1. Adjacent cells: (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F (mine), (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1. So (3,0) is 1, which is the mine at (3,1). Correct.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" (4,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. The 1 at (4,8) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,8)=1 (safe), (3,9)=1 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (5,9)=2 (safe). The unknown is (4,9)=?. So (4,9) could be a mine? Let's see: (4,8) has 1 mine. The adjacent cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. So (3,7) is 0 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), (5,7)=1 (safe). (3,8)=1 (safe, since it's a number), (3,9)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (5,9)=2 (safe). So the only possible mine is (4,9). So (4,9) is a mine? Then we should flag it.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" (5,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F (mine). The 1 at (5,7) should have 1 mine. (6,8)=F (mine) is adjacent, so that's correct.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" (6,7)=1. Adjacent cells: (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=F (mine), (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. The 1 at (6,7) has the mine at (6,8)=F, which is correct. (6,8) is a flag, and since the score is 0.4, that's a correct mine.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" (7,3)=F. Adjacent cells: (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. The F at (7,3) is a mine, and since the score counts it as correct, that's a mine. The 1's around it make sense.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" All safe.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" Safe.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" (10,3)=?. Let's check (10,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. The 1 at (10,2) means 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells: (9,2)=1 (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (10,1)=0 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). The unknown is (10,3)=?. So (10,3) must be a mine? Because the 1 at (10,2) has only (10,3) as a possible mine. Let's confirm: (10,2) is 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(9,1)=0 (safe)\n(9,2)=1 (safe)\n(9,3)=1 (safe)\n(10,1)=0 (safe)\n(10,3)=? (unknown)\n(11,1)=0 (safe)\n(11,2)=1 (safe)\n(11,3)=1 (safe)\nSo only (10,3) is unknown. Therefore, (10,3) must be a mine. So we should flag (10,3).\n\nWait, but let's check another cell. Let's look at row 0, column 9 is '?'. From earlier, (0,8)=1. The adjacent cells of (0,8) are (0,7)=0, (0,9)=?, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. So (0,8) has 1 mine, which must be (0,9). So (0,9) is a mine.\n\nSimilarly, (4,9)=? in row 4, column 9. (4,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. (3,7)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,7)=1 are safe. (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2 are safe (they are numbers). So (4,9) is the only possible mine for (4,8)'s 1. So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 9 is 1. Let's check (1,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (0,8)=1, (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (1,8)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (1,9)=1. The adjacent cells: (0,8)=1 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe), (2,8)=0 (safe), (2,9)=0 (safe), (2,10)=1 (safe). The unknowns are (0,9)=? and (0,10)=?. So (1,9)=1 means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,9) is a mine (as deduced earlier), then that's 1 mine, so (0,10) is safe. So (0,10) can be uncovered.\n\nLet's verify (0,10). (0,9) is a mine (flagged), then (0,10) is adjacent to (0,9) (mine) and (1,9)=1. (1,10)=2. Let's check (1,10)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,9)=?, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?. (1,10)=2. If (0,9) is a mine (1), then (0,10) or (0,11) or (1,11) or (2,11) could be the second mine. But maybe (0,10) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, let's find a cell that is definitely safe to uncover. Let's look for 0 cells, which when uncovered, reveal all adjacent cells. For example, row 0, column 6 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe, so any unknown adjacent to 0 can be uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 6 (0,6)=0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All are known, so no unknowns there.\n\nRow 0, column 7=0. Adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. All known.\n\nRow 1, column 6=0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All known.\n\nRow 1, column 7=0.

The 1 at (7,9) has the mine at (6,8)=F, correct.\n\nRow 8-12: mostly 0s and 1s, all known except for some '?' in row 0, 1, 4, 10.\n\nNow, let's find a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 0, column 10: (0,10)=?. Let's check the adjacent cells. (0,9)=? (we think it's a mine), (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (1,10)=2. If (0,9) is a mine (1), then (1,10)=2 needs one more mine. Possible candidates: (0,10), (0,11), (1,11), (2,11). But maybe (0,10) is safe. Alternatively, let's look for a 0 cell that has unknowns.\n\nWait, row 2, column 9=0. (2,9)=0. Adjacent cells: (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All known, so no unknowns.\n\nRow 3, column 10=2. Adjacent cells: (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0. (3,10)=2. If (4,9) is a mine (as we thought), that's 1 mine. Then another mine could be (2,11) or (3,11) or (4,11)=0 (safe). So (3,11)=1 is safe, (4,11)=0 is safe, so (2,11) could be a mine.\n\nBut maybe instead of trying to find mines, let's find a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 7=1, which is adjacent to (5,8)=2. But 2's adjacent cells may have mines, but not helpful.\n\nWait, row 4, column 9=? (we think it's a mine), row 0, column 9=? (mine), row 10, column 3=? (mine). So we can flag those. But the user's current flags are 4\/10 correct, so we need to flag 6 more. But maybe first, let's uncover a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 12=?. Let's check (0,11)=?. (0,12) is adjacent to (0,11)=?, (1,11)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 1, column 12=?. (1,11)=?, (1,12)=?, (2,11)=?, (2,12)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 10, column 3=? (we think mine), row 10, column 4=1. (10,4)=1. Adjacent cells: (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,3)=?, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0. (10,4)=1. If (10,3) is a mine (1), then that's correct. So (10,3) is a mine.\n\nLet's summarize the possible mines we've deduced:\n\n- (0,9)\n- (4,9)\n- (10,3)\n\nAre there others? Let's check row 1, column 3=?. (1,3)=?. Let's look at (1,2)=2. (1,2) is 2, adjacent to (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3. (2,2) has adjacent (3,1)=F (mine), so 1 mine. So (2,2)=3 needs 2 more mines. The adjacent cells of (2,2) are (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. So (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) must contain 2 mines. (1,2)=2 is safe, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1 are safe.\n\nAlso, (1,4)=2. (1,4)=2. Adjacent cells: (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F (mine), (0,5)=1, (1,3)=?, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. (1,4)=2. The mine at (0,4)=F is 1, so (1,4)=2 needs 1 more mine. So either (1,3) or (2,3) is a mine.\n\nSince (2,2)=3 needs 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), and (1,4)=2 needs 1 mine in (1,3) or (2,3), let's assume (1,3) is a mine. Then (1,4)=2 would have 1 mine (correct), and (2,2)=3 would have (1,3) as 1 mine, needing 1 more. So (2,1) or (2,3) is a mine. If (2,3) is a mine, then (1,4)=2 would have 2 mines (too many). So (2,3) can't be a mine. So (2,3) is safe. Then (2,2)=3 needs 2 mines, so (1,1) and (2,1) are mines. But this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to uncover a safe cell.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 7=1 is adjacent to (5,8)=2, but 2's adjacent cells are (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. (5,8)=2. The known mines are (6,8)=F (1 mine), so (5,8)=2 needs 1 more mine, which is (4,9)=? (as we thought earlier). So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nAnother safe cell: row 0, column 10=?. Let's check (0,10) adjacent to (0,9)=? (mine), (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (2,10)=1. (2,10) adjacent cells: (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1. (2,10)=1. The known mines: if (0,9) is a mine, (1,10)=2 has 2 mines. Maybe (0,10) is safe. Let's assume (0,9) is a mine, so (0,10) is adjacent to 1 mine (at (0,9)), but (0,10) itself is unknown. If (0,10) is a number, it would show the count. But since we can't be sure, maybe find a cell that's definitely safe.\n\nWait, row 4, column 9=? (mine), so if we flag that, it's a correct flag. Similarly, (0,9)=? (mine), (10,3)=? (mine). Let's check if these are correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is '?' and adjacent to a 0. For example, row 2, column 9=0. Adjacent cells: (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All known, so no unknowns.\n\nRow 3, column 9=1. Adjacent cells: (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,10)=2, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1. (3,9)=1. The known mines: if (4,9) is a mine, then (3,9)=1 is correct (1 mine). So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nRow 4, column 10=1. Adjacent cells: (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,11)=0, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=0. (4,10)=1. If (4,9) is a mine, then (4,10)=1 is correct (1 mine). So that checks out.\n\nRow 5, column 9=2. Adjacent cells: (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0. (5,9)=2. Known mines: (6,8)=F (1 mine), and if (4,9) is a mine (1), then 2 mines total. Correct. So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nSo (4,9) is definitely a mine. Let's flag that: 'flag (4,9)'.\n\nWait, but the user's current flags are 4\/10, so adding this would make 5\/10, score 0.5. But maybe there's a safer move. Alternatively, let's find a cell that's safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 10=?. Let's see (0,10) is adjacent to (0,9)=? (mine), (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1. (1,9)=1. (1,9) is 1, which means 1 mine in adjacent cells. We think (0,9) is a mine, so that's 1. So (1,9) is correct. Then (0,10) is adjacent to (0,9)=mine (1), so if (0,10) is uncovered, it would show 1. But since it's unknown, maybe it's safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, row 1, column 0=?. (1,0)=?. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3. (0,0)=1. (0,0) adjacent cells: (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1 means 1 mine in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1)=1, which is a number (safe), so (1,0) or (1,1) is a mine. So (1,0) could be a mine, so not safe.\n\nRow 1, column 1=?. (1,1)=?. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3. (1,2)=2. (1,2)=2 has adjacent (2,2)=3, which is 3 mines. This is getting too complex.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0. Let's check row 2, column 8=0. Adjacent cells: (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. All known. No unknowns.\n\nRow 3, column 7=0. Adjacent cells: (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All known.\n\nRow 4, column 7=0. Adjacent cells: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All known.\n\nRow 5, column 6=0. Adjacent cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1. All known.\n\nRow 6, column 6=0. Adjacent cells: (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1. All known.\n\nRow 7, column 6=0. Adjacent cells: (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,7)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0. All known.\n\nRow 8, column 7=0. Adjacent cells: (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (8,6)=0, (8,8)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=0. All known.\n\nSo all 0 cells have their adjacent cells known. Therefore, the remaining unknowns are either mines or numbers. Since we need to either flag all mines or uncover all safe cells, and we have 4 correct flags, we need to find more mines to flag.\n\nFrom earlier deductions:\n\n- (0,9) is a mine (from (0,8)=1)\n- (4,9) is a mine (from (4,8)=1)\n- (10,3) is a mine (from (10,2)=1)\n\nLet's verify (10,3)=?. (10,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. (10,2)=1 has 1 mine. The known cells are all safe except (10,3). So (10,3) must be a mine.\n\nAnother possible mine: row 1, column 3=?. Let's check (1,4)=2. (1,4)=2 has adjacent (0,4)=F (mine) and (1,3)=? or (2,3)=?. Since (1,4)=2 needs 2 mines, and (0,4)=F is 1, then (1,3) or (2,3) is a mine. Let's assume (1,3) is a mine.\n\nBut without more info, it's hard. So the safest move is to flag the ones we're sure about. Let's pick (0,9) first. So the action would be 'flag (0,9)'.\n\nAnswer: flag (0,9)","flag (0,9)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current state of the game. The board is 9x9, but the given current board seems to have 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a typo, but maybe it's just the way it's displayed. Let's focus on the rules and the current board.\n\nThe score is 0.5, which means 5 out of 10 mines are correctly flagged. The flags are 5\/10, so there are 5 F's on the board, but some might be incorrect. The unflags are 0, so no flags have been removed yet.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. We need to make a move that helps towards winning.\n\nFirst, let's look at the current board. Let's parse the rows. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list them row by row with their indices (assuming rows start at 0):\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → columns 0-12? Wait, the original Minesweeper is 9x9, so maybe the display is a mistake. Maybe each row is 9 columns, and the rest are typos. Let's assume it's a 9x9 grid. Let's check the input again. The problem statement says it's a 9x9 grid, so probably the current board is presented with some formatting error. Let's take the first 9 rows and 9 columns each.\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, 1, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [?, ?, 2, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 2: [?, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (columns 0-8)\nRow 3: [1, F, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2] (columns 0-8)\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, F] (columns 0-8)\nRow 7: [0, 0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 8: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (columns 0-8)\n\nThat makes more sense as a 9x9 grid. Now, let's analyze the cells.\n\nFirst, cells with 0 mean all adjacent cells are safe, so those can be automatically uncovered. Let's check where 0s are:\n\nRow 0: columns 6,7 are 0 → their adjacent cells (up, down, left, right, diagonals) should be safe. Let's check row 0, column 6 (0,6) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5) is 1, (0,7) is 0, (1,5) is 1, (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0. Since (0,6) is 0, all adjacent cells are safe. So (1,6) and (1,7) are 0, which means their adjacent cells are also safe. Let's check row 1, column 6 (1,6) is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). All these should be safe. (2,5) is 0, (2,6) is 0, (2,7) is 0. So row 2, columns 5-7 are 0, which means their adjacent cells are safe.\n\nLooking at row 3, columns 5-7: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. So their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (3,5) is 0, so (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6) are safe. (2,4) is 1, (3,4) is 1, (4,4) is 0, etc. These are already uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that are '?' which are unknown. We need to find safe cells to uncover or identify mines to flag.\n\nLet's check flagged cells (F). There are F's at:\n\n(0,4), (0,8), (3,1), (6,8), (7,3). That's 5 F's, which matches the \"Flags: 5\/10\" info.\n\nWe need to check if these F's are correct. Let's verify some.\n\nTake (3,1): row 3, column 1 is F. Let's look at the adjacent cells. The cell to the right is (3,2) which is 2. (3,2) is a number, which means it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells of (3,2) are:\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3).\n\n(3,1) is F (flagged as mine), (3,3) is 1 (uncovered), (4,1) is 1 (uncovered), (4,2) is 1 (uncovered), (4,3) is 0 (uncovered). (2,1) is ?, (2,2) is 3 (uncovered), (2,3) is ?. So (3,2) has 2 mines. If (3,1) is a mine, then there's 1 mine here. Are there others? (2,1) or (2,3) could be the second mine. So maybe (3,1) is a correct flag, but not sure yet.\n\nAnother F is (0,4). Let's check (0,3) which is 1. (0,3) is adjacent to (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,4) is F. (0,3) is 1, so there should be 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,4) is a mine, that's the 1, so the other adjacent cells (0,2=1, 1,2=2, 1,3=?, 1,4=2) are safe. That could be correct.\n\n(0,8) is F. Let's check (0,7)=0. (0,7) is 0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (0,7) adjacent cells include (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,8) is F, but (0,7) is 0, which means (0,8) cannot be a mine. Because if (0,8) were a mine, then (0,7) would have at least 1 mine adjacent, but (0,7) is 0. So (0,8) is a wrong flag! That's a problem. So (0,8) is flagged but it's a safe cell. So we should unflag that, but the user hasn't unflagged any yet (Unflags: 0). But maybe the current move is to uncover a safe cell.\n\nWait, (0,7) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). Since (0,7) is 0, all these cells are safe. (0,6) is 0, (0,8) is F (but should be safe), (1,6) is 0, (1,7) is 0, (1,8) is 1. So (1,8) is 1, which is uncovered. So (0,8) is safe, so the F there is incorrect. So that's a wrong flag.\n\nAnother F is (6,8). Let's check (5,8)=2. (5,8) is adjacent to (4,7), (4,8), (5,7), (6,7), (6,8), (5,9) but 9 is beyond 8. So (5,8) adjacent cells: (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,7)=1, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. (5,8) is 2, so there should be 2 mines in adjacent cells. If (6,8) is a mine, that's 1. Are there others? (4,8) is 1 (uncovered), (5,7) is 1 (uncovered), (6,7) is 1 (uncovered). (4,7) is 0 (uncovered). So maybe (6,8) is a mine, and another mine in (5,8) adjacent? Maybe, but not sure yet.\n\n(7,3) is F. Let's check (7,2)=1. (7,2) adjacent cells: (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,3) is F, (7,2) is 1. So (7,2) has 1 mine adjacent. If (7,3) is a mine, that's the 1, so others are safe. That could be correct.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells. The '?' are unknown cells that are not flagged. Let's find which cells are '?'. Looking at the 9x9 grid:\n\nRow 0: columns 9-12 are ?, but we're assuming 9x9, so maybe row 0 has all columns 0-8 uncovered except maybe not. Wait, the initial problem statement's current board might have been pasted incorrectly. Let's re-express the current board correctly. The user probably made a formatting error, but let's assume that each row is 9 cells. Let's list each row properly:\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, 1, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: [?, ?, 2, ?, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 2: [?, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (columns 0-8)\nRow 3: [1, F, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 4: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2] (columns 0-8)\nRow 6: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, F] (columns 0-8)\nRow 7: [0, 0, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] (columns 0-8)\nRow 8: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (columns 0-8)\n\nSo the '?' cells are in:\n\nRow 1: columns 0,1,3\nRow 2: columns 0,1,3\n\nSo (1,0), (1,1), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3) are '?'.\n\nWe need to determine which of these are safe to uncover.\n\nLet's take row 2, column 2 is 3. (2,2)=3. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\n(1,2)=2 (uncovered), (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=2 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered). So the adjacent cells that are unknown are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). (2,2) is 3, so there are 3 mines in these 4 cells.\n\nRow 1, column 2 is 2. (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\n(0,1)=1 (uncovered), (0,2)=1 (uncovered), (0,3)=1 (uncovered), (2,2)=3 (uncovered), (2,1)=? (unknown), (2,3)=? (unknown), (1,1)=? (unknown), (1,3)=? (unknown). (1,2)=2 means there are 2 mines in these 8 cells. But some are already uncovered (0,1-3 are 1s, which are safe). So the mines must be in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nFrom (2,2)=3, we know 3 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). From (1,2)=2, we know 2 mines in the same set. Wait, that's a contradiction unless I made a mistake. Let's recalculate.\n\n(1,2)=2: adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,1) → 1 (safe, not mine)\n(0,2) → 1 (safe)\n(0,3) → 1 (safe)\n(1,1) → ?\n(1,3) → ?\n(2,1) → ?\n(2,2) → 3 (safe, not mine)\n(2,3) → ?\n\nSo the possible mines are (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). So (1,2)=2 → 2 mines here.\n\n(2,2)=3: adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1) → ?\n(1,2) → 2 (safe)\n(1,3) → ?\n(2,1) → ?\n(2,3) → ?\n(3,1) → F (flagged as mine)\n(3,2) → 2 (safe)\n(3,3) → 1 (safe)\n\nSo (2,2)=3 has adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). (3,1) is F (flagged as mine). So if (3,1) is a mine, then (2,2) has 1 mine from (3,1), and needs 2 more mines from (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). But (1,2)=2 says there are 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). So that matches: (2,2)=3 would have 1 (from (3,1)) + 2 (from the four cells) = 3. That works. So (3,1) is a correct mine flag.\n\nSo (3,1) is a mine. Then, (1,2)=2 has 2 mines in (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). (2,2)=3 has 3 mines: (3,1) and 2 from the four cells. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, let's look at row 1, column 4 is 2. (1,4)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (1,3), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).\n\n(0,3)=1 (safe), (0,4)=F (flagged as mine), (0,5)=1 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe). So the adjacent cells that are unknown are (1,3) and (2,3). (1,4)=2 means there are 2 mines in adjacent cells. (0,4) is F, so if (0,4) is a mine, that's 1 mine. Then (1,3) or (2,3) must be the second mine.\n\n(0,4) is F. Let's check (0,3)=1. (0,3) adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,4)=F, (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=?, (1,4)=2 (safe). (0,3)=1 means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,4) is a mine, that's 1, so (1,3) must be safe. Because if (0,4) is a mine, then (0,3) has exactly 1 mine, so (1,3) can't be a mine. So (1,3) is safe.\n\nSo (1,3) is safe. Then, (1,4)=2: (0,4) is a mine (1), and (2,3) must be the second mine. Because (1,3) is safe, so (2,3) is a mine.\n\nSo (2,3) is a mine. Let's confirm with (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3's adjacent mines are (3,1), (2,3), and one more. So (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3) → we have (2,3) as mine, (3,1) as mine. So (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines. So (1,1), (2,1) could be the third mine.\n\nWait, (2,2)=3's adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). We have (3,1) is mine, (2,3) is mine. So that's 2 mines. Need 1 more from (1,1) or (2,1).\n\n(1,2)=2's adjacent mines: (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3). We have (2,3) is mine. So need 1 more mine here. So (1,1) or (2,1) is the second mine for (1,2)=2, which would also be the third mine for (2,2)=3. That works.\n\nNow, let's check (2,4)=1. (2,4)=1 is adjacent to (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (1,3)=? (we think safe), (1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (2,3)=mine (we think), (2,5)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe). So (2,4)=1 should have 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (2,3) is a mine, that's 1, which matches. So that confirms (2,3) is a mine.\n\nSo (2,3) is a mine, so we should flag it. But the current flags are 5\/10, so maybe we can flag that. But the user's move could be to uncover a safe cell.\n\nWe determined (1,3) is safe (from (0,3)=1 and (0,4) being a mine). So (1,3) is a '?', and it's safe. So we can uncover (1,3).\n\nLet's confirm. (0,3)=1: adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,4)=F (mine), (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,4)=2 (safe). So the only possible mine in (0,3)'s adjacent cells is (0,4). So (0,3)=1 has exactly 1 mine (0,4), so (1,3) must be safe. Therefore, (1,3) can be safely uncovered.\n\nSo the best move is to uncover (1,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,3)","uncover (1,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's understand the current state of the game. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the given current board seems to have more rows and columns. Wait, maybe it's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given data. The score is 0.5, meaning 5 correct flags out of 10. Flags are 5\/10, so 5 flags placed, 5 correct. Unflags are 0.\n\nThe goal is to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered. So I need to make a move that helps towards winning.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list the rows with their coordinates (row, col). Assuming the rows are 0-based, starting from the top. Let's index them as row 0 to row 12, and columns 0 to 12? Because each row has 13 elements. Wait, the problem statement says 9x9 grid, but the current board has 13 columns and 13 rows? Maybe that's a mistake, but perhaps it's a larger board. Let's proceed.\n\nFirst, let's look for cells that are '?' (unknown) and see if we can determine if they are safe or mines based on the numbers around them.\n\nLet's take row 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" So columns 0-12. The 'F's here are at (0,4) and (0,9). Since the score is 0.5, 5 correct flags, so these might be correct or not. But let's focus on '?' cells.\n\nRow 0 has '?' at (0,10), (0,11), (0,12).\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" So '?' at (1,0), (1,1), (1,11), (1,12).\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" '?' at (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,11), (2,12).\n\nRow 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" Here, (3,1) is F.\n\nRow 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" '?' at (4,9).\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" No '?'.\n\nRow 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" (6,8) is F.\n\nRow 7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" (7,3) is F.\n\nRow 8: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" No '?'.\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" No '?'.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" '?' at (10,3).\n\nRow 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" No '?'.\n\nRow 12: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" No '?'.\n\nSo the '?' cells are at:\n\n(0,10), (0,11), (0,12),\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,11), (1,12),\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (2,11), (2,12),\n\n(4,9),\n\n(10,3).\n\nNow, let's look for cells with numbers that can help us determine if adjacent '?' are safe or mines.\n\nLet's start with row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\". The cell (4,9) is '?'. Let's check its neighbors. The cell (4,8) is 1. The 1 at (4,8) means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (4,8) are:\n\n(3,7), (3,8), (3,9),\n\n(4,7), (4,9),\n\n(5,7), (5,8), (5,9).\n\nLooking at these:\n\n(3,7) is 0 (from row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,7) is 0),\n\n(3,8) is 1,\n\n(3,9) is 1,\n\n(4,7) is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,7) is 0),\n\n(4,9) is '?',\n\n(5,7) is 1 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,7) is 1),\n\n(5,8) is 2,\n\n(5,9) is 2.\n\nSo the 1 at (4,8) has adjacent cells. The known cells: (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. The only unknown adjacent cell is (4,9). Since the 1 at (4,8) needs exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. Let's count the existing possible mines. The cells that are F (flags) in adjacent area? (3,1) is F, but that's far. The adjacent cells to (4,8) don't have any F's. So the 1 at (4,8) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells, which are (4,9) or others. Wait, (3,8) is 1, which is a number, not a mine. (3,9) is 1, also a number. (5,7) is 1, number. (5,8) is 2, number. (5,9) is 2, number. So all adjacent cells except (4,9) are numbers or 0. So the 1 at (4,8) must have exactly 1 mine in adjacent cells. Since all others are safe (numbers mean they are uncovered and not mines), the only possible mine is (4,9). But wait, if (4,9) is a mine, then the 1 at (4,8) would have 1 mine, which matches. But let's check the cell (4,10) which is 1. (4,10) is 1, so it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (4,10) are:\n\n(3,9), (3,10), (3,11),\n\n(4,9), (4,11),\n\n(5,9), (5,10), (5,11).\n\n(3,9) is 1 (row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,9) is 1),\n\n(3,10) is 2,\n\n(3,11) is 1,\n\n(4,9) is '?',\n\n(4,11) is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,11) is 0),\n\n(5,9) is 2 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,9) is 2),\n\n(5,10) is 1,\n\n(5,11) is 0.\n\nSo the 1 at (4,10) has adjacent cells. The known cells are all numbers, so the only unknown is (4,9). If (4,9) is a mine, then (4,10) would have 1 mine (from (4,9)), which matches the 1. So that's consistent. So (4,9) is likely a mine. But wait, the 2 at (5,8) (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,8) is 2). The 2 at (5,8) has adjacent cells:\n\n(4,7), (4,8), (4,9),\n\n(5,7), (5,9),\n\n(6,7), (6,8), (6,9).\n\n(4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1 (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" so (6,7) is 1), (6,8)=F (flag), (6,9)=1.\n\nSo the 2 at (5,8) needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. Let's count: (6,8) is a flag (F). If that flag is correct (since the score is 0.5, 5 correct flags), then (6,8) is a mine. So that's 1 mine. Then, the other mine must be (4,9) because that's the only other unknown adjacent cell. So (5,8) has 2 mines: (6,8) and (4,9). That would make (4,9) a mine. So (4,9) is a mine, so we should flag it? But let's check other areas.\n\nAnother cell: row 2 has a 3 at (2,2). Let's see. (2,2) is 3. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n\n(2,1), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,1)=?, (1,0)=?.\n\nRow 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?.\n\nRow 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\nSo (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,3), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). Wait, 8 adjacent cells: (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1). So (2,2) adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n\n(2,1), (2,3),\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nSo 8 cells. Let's list them:\n\n(1,1): ?\n\n(1,2): 2 (uncovered, safe)\n\n(1,3): 2 (uncovered, safe)\n\n(2,1): ?\n\n(2,3): ?\n\n(3,1): F (flagged)\n\n(3,2): 2 (uncovered, safe)\n\n(3,3): 1 (uncovered, safe)\n\nSo the 3 at (2,2) needs 3 mines in these 8 cells. The known safe cells are (1,2), (1,3), (3,2), (3,3). The flagged cell (3,1) is F. If (3,1) is a correct flag (mine), that's 1 mine. The remaining 2 mines must be in the unknown cells: (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). Let's see how many unknowns there are.\n\nAlso, (1,2) is 2. Let's check (1,2)=2. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3),\n\n(1,1), (1,3),\n\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nRow 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" so (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F.\n\nSo (1,2)=2 has adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe),\n\n(1,1)=?, (1,3)=2 (safe),\n\n(2,1)=?, (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=?.\n\nSo (1,2)=2 needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. The unknown cells here are (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). So 2 mines among these three.\n\nFrom (2,2)=3, we need 3 mines, with (3,1)=F (mine) being 1, so 2 more from (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). Which matches the (1,2)=2 needing 2 mines in those same three. So that's consistent. So those three cells have 2 mines.\n\nNow, (2,3) is a '?'. Let's check (2,4)=1 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,4)=1). (2,4)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n\n(2,3), (2,5),\n\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1.\n\nRow 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0.\n\nSo (2,4)=1's adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,3)=2 (safe), (1,4)=2 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe),\n\n(2,3)=?, (2,5)=0 (safe),\n\n(3,3)=1 (safe), (3,4)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe).\n\nSo (2,4)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells, which can only be (2,3). Because all others are safe. So (2,3) must be a mine. Because if (2,3) is a mine, then (2,4)=1 has 1 mine, which matches. Then, going back to (2,2)=3: (3,1)=F (mine) is 1, (2,3)=mine is 2, so the third mine must be in (1,1) or (2,1). And (1,2)=2: (2,3)=mine is 1, so the other mine is in (1,1) or (2,1). So (2,3) is a mine. Therefore, (2,3) should be flagged.\n\nWait, but let's confirm. (2,4)=1 has only (2,3) as unknown adjacent cell. So (2,3) must be a mine. So that's a mine. So we can flag (2,3).\n\nAnother cell: row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (10,3) is '?'. Let's check (10,2)=1. (10,2)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(9,1), (9,2), (9,3),\n\n(10,1), (10,3),\n\n(11,1), (11,2), (11,3).\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1.\n\nRow 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1.\n\n(10,1)=0 (row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"), (10,3)=?, (10,2)=1.\n\nSo (10,2)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1,\n\n(10,1)=0, (10,3)=?,\n\n(11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1.\n\nAll these cells except (10,3) are uncovered and not mines (since they are numbers or 0). So the 1 at (10,2) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells, which can only be (10,3). Therefore, (10,3) is a mine. So we should flag (10,3).\n\nBut wait, let's check (10,4)=1. (10,4)=1's adjacent cells:\n\n(9,3), (9,4), (9,5),\n\n(10,3), (10,5),\n\n(11,3), (11,4), (11,5).\n\nRow 9: (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0.\n\nRow 11: (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0.\n\n(10,3)=?, (10,5)=0 (row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\").\n\nSo (10,4)=1's adjacent cells are all uncovered except (10,3). So the 1 at (10,4) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells, which is (10,3). So that confirms (10,3) is a mine.\n\nSo (10,3) is a mine. So we can flag that.\n\nNow, let's check the '?' at (4,9). Earlier analysis suggested it's a mine. Let's confirm with (5,9)=2 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,9)=2). (5,9)=2's adjacent cells:\n\n(4,8), (4,9), (4,10),\n\n(5,8), (5,10),\n\n(6,8), (6,9), (6,10).\n\n(4,8)=1 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\"), (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1.\n\n(5,8)=2, (5,10)=1.\n\n(6,8)=F (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"), (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0.\n\nSo (5,9)=2 needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. (6,8)=F is a flag, which if correct, is 1 mine. The other mine must be (4,9). So (5,9)=2 has 2 mines: (6,8) and (4,9). So (4,9) is a mine. So we should flag (4,9).\n\nNow, the current flags are 5\/10. We have 5 flags placed. If we flag (2,3), (10,3), (4,9), that's 3 more, but we need to make sure they are actual mines.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are safe cells to uncover. Let's look for cells that are '?' and have adjacent 0s, which would mean they can be uncovered safely.\n\nLooking at row 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\". The 0s are at (0,6), (0,7). Adjacent to 0s, the cells around them should be safe. For example, (0,6)=0, so all 8 adjacent cells are safe. Let's check (0,6) adjacent cells:\n\n( -1,5): out of bounds,\n\n( -1,6): out of bounds,\n\n( -1,7): out of bounds,\n\n(0,5):1,\n\n(0,7):0,\n\n(1,5):1 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\"),\n\n(1,6):0,\n\n(1,7):0.\n\nSo (0,6)=0's adjacent cells are all safe (since 0 means no mines around), so the cells adjacent to (0,6) are safe. The cell (0,8)=1 is adjacent to (0,7)=0. (0,7)=0's adjacent cells:\n\n( -1,6), ( -1,7), ( -1,8),\n\n(0,6)=0, (0,8)=1,\n\n(1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,8)=1).\n\nAll of these are safe, so any '?' adjacent to 0s can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,10), (0,11), (0,12) are '?'. Let's see if they are adjacent to 0s. (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F. (0,10) is next to (0,9)=F and (1,9)=1 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,9)=1). (1,10)=2 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,10)=2). (0,10) is adjacent to (0,9)=F (maybe mine), (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2. Not sure.\n\nRow 1 has (1,0), (1,1) as '?'. Let's check (2,0)=? and (2,1)=? (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\"). (3,0)=1 (row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\"). So (3,0)=1, which has adjacent cells:\n\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=3,\n\n(3,1)=F,\n\n(4,0)=1 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\").\n\nSo (3,0)=1 has adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)=3, (3,1)=F, (4,0)=1. So (3,0)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. (3,1)=F is a flag, which if correct, is a mine. So that's 1 mine, so (2,0) and (2,1) must be safe. Because if (3,1)=F is a mine, then (3,0)=1's count is satisfied. So (2,0) and (2,1) are safe. Therefore, (2,0) and (2,1) can be uncovered safely.\n\nSimilarly, (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0)=1 (row 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\"), (0,1)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1 has adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, so (0,0)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (1,0) and (1,1) are safe (since (2,0) and (2,1) are safe, as per (3,0)=1), then (0,0)=1's mine must be elsewhere. But maybe (1,0) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, since (3,0)=1 and (3,1)=F (mine), then (3,0)=1's count is 1 (from (3,1)), so (2,0) and (2,1) are safe. So (2,0) and (2,1) can be uncovered. Let's pick (2,0) or (2,1). Let's check (2,0). If we uncover (2,0), since it's safe, it will show a number indicating adjacent mines.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for 0 cells. Row 5 has a lot of 0s. For example, (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, etc. The 0s mean their adjacent cells are all safe. So any '?' adjacent to 0s can be uncovered.\n\nRow 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\". The 0s in row 5, columns 0-5. So (5,0)=0, adjacent cells:\n\n(4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1,\n\n(5,1)=0,\n\n(6,0)=0 (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\"), (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1.\n\nAll adjacent cells to (5,0)=0 are safe, so any '?' in their vicinity can be uncovered.\n\nBut the '?' cells are mostly in the top-left and some in the top-right. Let's go back to (2,0) and (2,1). Since (3,0)=1 and (3,1)=F (mine), the mine count for (3,0)=1 is 1 (from (3,1)), so (2,0) and (2,1) are safe. So uncovering (2,0) or (2,1) is safe. Let's choose (2,0) as an example.\n\nAlternatively, let's check row 1, (1,0) and (1,1). (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (2,0)=?, (2,1)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,0) are (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?. So (0,0)=1 needs 1 mine in these three. If (1,0) and (1,1) are safe, then there's no mine, which contradicts. So maybe one of them is a mine. But earlier, (3,0)=1's adjacent cells include (2,0) and (2,1), which are safe. So (2,0) and (2,1) are safe, so (1,0) and (1,1) could have a mine. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 0 has (0,6)=0 and (0,7)=0. The cell (1,6)=0 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\") and (1,7)=0. So (1,6)=0 and (1,7)=0. The cell (2,6)=0 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\") and (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. These 0s form a region of safe cells. The '?' cells adjacent to these 0s would be safe. For example, (0,8)=1 is adjacent to (0,7)=0, which is safe. (1,8)=1 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\") is adjacent to (1,7)=0, so safe.\n\nLooking at row 0, (0,10), (0,11), (0,12) are '?'. Let's check (0,10) adjacent cells:\n\n(0,9)=F, (0,11)=?,\n\n(1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?.\n\n(1,10)=2 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\") has adjacent cells. (1,10)=2's adjacent cells:\n\n(0,9)=F, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?,\n\n(1,9)=1, (1,11)=?,\n\n(2,9)=0 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,9)=0), (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?.\n\n(2,10)=1 (row 2: \"? ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\") has adjacent cells:\n\n(1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?,\n\n(2,9)=0, (2,11)=?,\n\n(3,9)=1 (row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\"), (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1.\n\n(2,10)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The known cells are (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,9)=0, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1. The unknowns are (1,11)=?, (2,11)=?. So (2,10)=1 has 1 mine in (1,11) or (2,11). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a safe cell to uncover. Since the game ends at 100 epochs, we need to make progress. Let's pick a '?' that is likely safe. For example, (2,0) is a '?', and earlier analysis suggests it's safe. So uncover (2,0).\n\n\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,0)","uncover (2,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user provided the current board, which is a 13x13 grid (though the game is supposed to be 9x9, maybe that's a typo, but I'll go with the given data). Let's start by recalling the rules: the goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The score is the number of correctly flagged mines divided by 10, currently at 0.5, meaning 5 correct flags out of 10.\n\nFirst, let's parse the current board. Each row is a string of characters separated by spaces. Let's list out the coordinates (row, col) where each cell is. Remember that (0,0) is top-left. Let's index rows from 0 to 12 and columns from 0 to 12.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\nRow 1: ? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\nRow 2: 2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\nRow 3: 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow, let's note the flagged cells (F). Let's list their coordinates:\n\n- Row 0, col 4 (0,4)\n- Row 0, col 9 (0,9)\n- Row 3, col 1 (3,1)\n- Row 6, col 8 (6,8)\n- Row 7, col 3 (7,3)\n\nThat's 5 flags, which matches the \"Flags: 5\/10\" status. So these are the current flagged cells.\n\nThe win condition is to flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at the 100th epoch or if a mine is uncovered. The score is correct flags \/ 10, so to maximize the score, we need to flag as many correct mines as possible.\n\nNow, let's look for cells that can be logically determined to be mines or safe. Let's start with known numbers and adjacent cells.\n\nTake row 3, col 0: value is 1. It's adjacent to (2,0), (2,1), (3,1) (which is F), (4,0). Since (3,1) is flagged, the 1 here means that exactly one of its adjacent cells is a mine, and that must be (3,1) since it's flagged. So that flag is correct (since 1's count is satisfied by the F there). So (3,1) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 0, col 4 is F. Let's check adjacent cells. Row 0, col 4 is at (0,4). Adjacent cells are (0,3), (0,5), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). The cell (0,3) is 1, (0,5) is 1, (1,3) is 2, (1,4) is 2, (1,5) is 1. Let's take (0,3): it's a 1, which is adjacent to (0,2), (0,4) (F), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The 1 at (0,3) has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=F, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2. The 1 here means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (0,4) is a mine (flagged), then that's the 1, so (0,4) is correct.\n\nRow 0, col 9 is F. Let's check (0,9). Adjacent cells: (0,8), (0,10), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10). (0,8) is 1, (0,10) is ?, (1,8) is 1, (1,9) is 1, (1,10) is 2. Let's look at (1,9) which is 1. (1,9) is adjacent to (0,8), (0,9) (F), (0,10), (1,8), (1,10), (2,8), (2,9), (2,10). The 1 at (1,9) has adjacent cells. If (0,9) is a mine, then the 1 would mean that there's 1 mine here. Let's see (1,8) is 1. (1,8) is adjacent to (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F, (1,7)=0, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. The 1 at (1,8) has adjacent cells. The 0s around (1,7), (2,7), (2,8), (2,9) are safe, so (1,8)'s 1 must come from (0,8) or (0,9) or (1,9). (0,8) is 1 (which is a number, so not a mine), (1,9) is 1 (number, not a mine), so (0,9) must be the mine. So (0,9) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 6, col 8 is F. Let's check (6,8). Adjacent cells: (5,7), (5,8), (5,9), (6,7), (6,9), (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,9)=1, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1. Let's look at (5,8)=2. (5,8) is adjacent to (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. The 2 at (5,8) needs 2 mines in adjacent cells. (4,7) is 0, so safe. (4,8) is 1 (number, safe). (5,7) is 1 (number, safe). (5,9) is 2 (number, safe). (6,7) is 1 (number, safe). (6,9) is 1 (number, safe). So the possible mines are (4,9) and (6,8). If (6,8) is a mine (flagged), then (5,8)'s 2 would need one more mine. (4,9) is ?, which could be a mine. Alternatively, (6,8) is a mine, and (4,9) is a mine. Let's check (6,7)=1. (6,7) is adjacent to (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=F, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. The 1 at (6,7) must have 1 mine in adjacent cells. The 0s (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) are safe. (5,7)=1 (number, safe), (5,8)=2 (number, safe), (7,7)=1 (number, safe), (7,8)=1 (number, safe). So the only possible mine is (6,8). Therefore, (6,8) is a correct flag.\n\nRow 7, col 3 is F. Let's check (7,3). Adjacent cells: (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (7,2), (7,4), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4). (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (7,2)=1, (7,4)=1, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1. Let's take (7,2)=1. (7,2) is adjacent to (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. The 1 at (7,2) has adjacent cells. The 0s (6,1), (7,1), (8,1) are safe. (6,2)=1 (number, safe), (6,3)=1 (number, safe), (8,2)=1 (number, safe), (8,3)=1 (number, safe). So the only possible mine is (7,3). Therefore, (7,3) is a correct flag. So all 5 flags are correct, which is why the score is 0.5 (5\/10).\n\nNow, we need to find cells that are safe to uncover or need to be flagged. Let's look for cells with known numbers that can help us determine safe cells.\n\nLet's start with row 0, which has some 0s. Row 0, col 6 is 0, col 7 is 0. A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells, so all adjacent cells can be uncovered. Let's check (0,6)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5)=1 (already uncovered), (0,7)=0 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,6)=0 (uncovered), (1,7)=0 (uncovered). So those are all safe.\n\nRow 0, col 8 is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,7)=0, (0,9)=F, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. The 1 at (0,8) has adjacent cells. (0,7)=0, (1,7)=0 are safe. (0,9)=F (mine), so that's 1 mine, which matches the 1. So (0,8) is safe.\n\nRow 1, col 6 is 0, col 7 is 0. (1,6)=0, adjacent cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,7), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0 (row 2, col 5: let's check row 2: \"2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so row 2, col 5 is 0, yes), (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. So (1,6)=0's adjacent cells are all safe, which is consistent.\n\nRow 2, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0, col 7 is 0, col 8 is 0, col 9 is 0. A 0 in (2,5) means adjacent cells (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are all safe. Let's check (2,5)=0: (1,4)=2 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,6)=0 (uncovered), (2,4)=1 (uncovered), (2,6)=0 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,4)=1), (3,5)=0 (row 3, col 5 is 0), (3,6)=0 (row 3, col 6 is 0). So all these are safe, which matches the 0.\n\nRow 3, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0, col 7 is 0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (3,5)=0: adjacent cells (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6). (2,4)=1 (uncovered), (2,5)=0 (uncovered), (2,6)=0 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,6)=0 (uncovered), (4,4)=0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,4)=0), (4,5)=0 (row 4, col 5=0), (4,6)=0 (row 4, col 6=0). All safe.\n\nRow 4, col 3 is 0, col 4 is 0, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0. (4,3)=0: adjacent cells (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4). (3,2)=2 (row 3: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,2)=2), (3,3)=1 (row 3, col 3=1), (3,4)=1 (row 3, col 4=1), (4,2)=1 (row 4, col 2=1), (4,4)=0 (row 4, col 4=0), (5,2)=0 (row 5: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,2)=0), (5,3)=0 (row 5, col 3=0), (5,4)=0 (row 5, col 4=0). All safe, which matches the 0.\n\nRow 5, col 0 is 0, col 1 is 0, col 2 is 0, col 3 is 0, col 4 is 0, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0. (5,6)=0: adjacent cells (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (5,5), (5,7), (6,5), (6,6), (6,7). (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0 (row 4, col 7=0), (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1 (row 5, col 7=1), (6,5)=0 (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" so (6,5)=0), (6,6)=0 (row 6, col 6=0), (6,7)=1 (row 6, col 7=1). (5,7)=1 and (6,7)=1 are numbers, so safe. So (5,6)=0 is correct.\n\nRow 6, col 0 is 0, col 1 is 0, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0. (6,0)=0: adjacent cells (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (6,1), (7,0), (7,1), (7,2). All these are 0 or 1 (numbers), so safe.\n\nRow 7, col 0 is 0, col 1 is 0, col 5 is 0, col 6 is 0. (7,0)=0: adjacent cells (6,0), (6,1), (6,2), (7,1), (8,0), (8,1), (8,2). All are 0 or 1 (numbers), safe.\n\nRow 8,9,10,11,12 have mostly 0s and 1s. Let's look for cells that are '?' which are unknown. Let's list all '?' positions:\n\nRow 0: cols 10,11,12 (0,10), (0,11), (0,12)\nRow 1: cols 0,1,11,12 (1,0), (1,1), (1,11), (1,12)\nRow 2: cols 1,3,11,12 (2,1), (2,3), (2,11), (2,12)\nRow 4: col 9 (4,9)\nRow 10: col 3 (10,3)\n\nSo the '?' cells are:\n\n(0,10), (0,11), (0,12),\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,11), (1,12),\n(2,1), (2,3), (2,11), (2,12),\n(4,9),\n(10,3)\n\nNow, let's analyze these to see which can be uncovered safely.\n\nStarting with (4,9): row 4, col 9 is '?'. Let's look at the surrounding numbers. Row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1. Adjacent cells to (4,9) are (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), (4,8), (4,10), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10).\n\nLet's list these adjacent cells:\n\n(3,8): row 3, col 8: \"1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1\" so (3,8)=1\n(3,9): (3,9)=1\n(3,10): (3,10)=2\n(4,8): (4,8)=1\n(4,10): (4,10)=1\n(5,8): row 5, col 8: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0\" so (5,8)=2\n(5,9): (5,9)=2\n(5,10): (5,10)=1\n\nNow, let's take (5,8)=2. (5,8) is adjacent to (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. We already determined (6,8)=F is a mine. So (5,8) has 2 mines in adjacent cells. So far, (6,8)=F is one mine. So there's 1 more mine in (4,9), (5,9), or (4,8). (4,8)=1 is a number, so not a mine. (5,9)=2 is a number, not a mine. So (4,9) must be the second mine. Wait, (5,8)=2: adjacent cells are 8 cells. Let's count:\n\n(4,7)=0 (safe)\n(4,8)=1 (safe, since it's a number)\n(4,9)=? (unknown)\n(5,7)=1 (safe, number)\n(5,9)=2 (safe, number)\n(6,7)=1 (safe, number)\n(6,8)=F (mine)\n(6,9)=1 (safe, number)\n\nSo the only possible mine is (4,9). Because (6,8) is 1 mine, so (5,8) needs 1 more mine. Therefore, (4,9) must be a mine. So we should flag (4,9). But wait, let's check another cell to confirm.\n\n(5,9)=2. (5,9) is adjacent to (4,8)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0 (row 6, col 10 is 0). So (5,9)=2 has adjacent cells. (6,8)=F is a mine (1), (4,9)=? could be a mine (2). The others are numbers or 0, so safe. So (5,9)=2's 2 mines are (6,8) and (4,9). That confirms (4,9) is a mine. So (4,9) should be flagged. But let's check other cells.\n\nNext, (2,3) is '?'. Row 2: \"2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,3) is (2,3). Let's look at (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3: adjacent cells are (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,2)=2 (row 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,2)=2), (1,3)=2 (row 1, col 3=2), (1,4)=2 (row 1, col 4=2), (2,1)=? (row 2, col 1=?), (2,3)=?, (3,1)=F (row 3, col 1=F, which is a mine), (3,2)=2 (row 3, col 2=2), (3,3)=1 (row 3, col 3=1). (3,1)=F is a mine, so that's 1 mine. (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines in adjacent cells. Let's list adjacent cells:\n\n(1,1)=? (unknown)\n(1,2)=2 (safe)\n(1,3)=2 (safe)\n(2,1)=? (unknown)\n(2,3)=? (unknown)\n(3,1)=F (mine)\n(3,2)=2 (safe)\n(3,3)=1 (safe)\n\nSo the 3 mines must be among (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). Let's check (2,0)=2 (row 2, col 0=2). (2,0)=2: adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (1,0)=? (unknown), (1,1)=? (unknown), (2,1)=? (unknown), (3,0)=1 (row 3, col 0=1), (3,1)=F (mine). (3,1)=F is a mine, so (2,0)=2 needs 1 more mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). \n\nNow, (1,2)=2 (row 1, col 2=2). (1,2)=2: adjacent cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=1 (row 0, col 1=1), (0,2)=1 (row 0, col 2=1), (0,3)=1 (row 0, col 3=1), (1,1)=? (unknown), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,1)=? (unknown), (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=? (unknown). (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are all 1s, which are numbers, so safe. (1,3)=2 and (2,2)=3 are safe. So (1,2)=2 needs 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3).\n\nLet's summarize:\n\n- (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) (since others are safe)\n- (1,2)=2 needs 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3)\n- (2,0)=2 needs 1 mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)\n\nIf (2,2)=3 requires 3 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), and (1,2)=2 requires 2 mines in the same three, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's recount the adjacent cells for (2,2)=3.\n\n(2,2) is at row 2, col 2. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1) = (1,1)\n(row-1, col) = (1,2)\n(row-1, col+1) = (1,3)\n(row, col-1) = (2,1)\n(row, col+1) = (2,3)\n(row+1, col-1) = (3,1)\n(row+1, col) = (3,2)\n(row+1, col+1) = (3,3)\n\nYes, that's correct. (3,1)=F is a mine, so that's 1. The other cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3). (1,2)=2 (number, safe), (1,3)=2 (number, safe), (3,2)=2 (number, safe), (3,3)=1 (number, safe). So the remaining possible mines are (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). So 3 mines needed here, which would mean all three are mines.\n\n(1,2)=2: adjacent cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=1 (number, safe), (0,2)=1 (number, safe), (0,3)=1 (number, safe), (1,3)=2 (number, safe), (2,2)=3 (number, safe). So the mines here would be (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). That's 3 mines, but (1,2)=2 requires 2 mines. Contradiction. So maybe my initial assumption that (3,1) is a mine is wrong? Wait, no. (3,0)=1: adjacent cells are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0). (3,0)=1 is 1, and (3,1)=F is flagged. So (3,0) has 1 mine, which must be (3,1), so (3,1) is a mine. Therefore, (2,2)=3 must have 3 mines in its adjacent cells, including (3,1). So (2,2)=3's adjacent mines: (3,1) is 1, so need 2 more in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3).\n\n(1,2)=2: adjacent mines would be (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). If (2,2)=3 has (3,1) + 2 others, then (1,2)=2 would have 2 of those 2 others. That works. For example, if (2,1) and (2,3) are mines, then (2,2)=3 has (3,1), (2,1), (2,3) → 3 mines. (1,2)=2 has (2,1), (2,3) → 2 mines. Then (1,1) is safe. Let's check (2,0)=2: adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1). (3,0)=1 (number, safe), (3,1)=mine. So (2,0)=2 needs 1 more mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). If (2,1) is a mine, then (2,0)=2 has (3,1) and (2,1) → 2 mines, which matches. So (2,1) is a mine. Then (2,3) is a mine (since (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines). Then (1,2)=2 has (2,1) and (2,3) → 2 mines, which matches. (1,1) would be safe. Then (2,0)=2 has (2,1) and (3,1) → 2 mines, correct. So (2,1) and (2,3) are mines. (1,1) is safe.\n\nSo (2,1) and (2,3) are mines. Therefore, (2,3) is a mine, which is currently '?', so we should flag (2,3).\n\nAnother '?' is (10,3): row 10, col 3. Row 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". (10,3) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. (10,3) is at row 10, col 3. Adjacent cells are (9,2), (9,3), (9,4), (10,2), (10,4), (11,2), (11,3), (11,4).\n\nRow 9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1\nRow 10, col 2=1, col 4=1\nRow 11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1\n\nSo all adjacent cells to (10,3) are 1s (numbers), which are safe. So (10,3) must be a safe cell (since all adjacent 1s are numbers, meaning they have 1 mine in their adjacent cells, but (10,3) itself is not a mine because the 1s around it don't require it to be a mine). Wait, let's take (10,2)=1. (10,2)=1: adjacent cells (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. The 1 at (10,2) needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. The possible mines could be (9,2), (9,3), (11,2), (11,3), or (10,3). But (9,2)=1 is a number (safe), (9,3)=1 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe), (11,3)=1 (safe). So the only possible mine is (10,3). But that would mean (10,3) is a mine. Wait, but (10,4)=1. (10,4)=1: adjacent cells (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (10,3), (10,5), (11,3), (11,4), (11,5). (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (10,5)=0, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1, (11,5)=0. So (10,4)=1 needs 1 mine in adjacent cells. Possible mines: (9,3), (9,4), (11,3), (11,4), (10,3). Again, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1 are safe, so (10,3) must be the mine. Therefore, (10,3) is a mine, so we should flag it.\n\nNow, let's check the remaining '?' cells. Let's take (0,10): row 0, col 10 is '?'. Row 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" so (0,10) is '?'. Adjacent cells are (0,9)=F (mine), (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?. (1,10)=2: adjacent cells (0,9)=F, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?. (2,10)=1: adjacent cells (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1. (3,10)=2: adjacent cells (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0. (4,10)=1: adjacent cells (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,11)=0, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=0. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a safer cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are adjacent to 0s, which are guaranteed safe. For example, row 4, col 7 is 0 (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,7)=0). Adjacent cells to (4,7)=0 are (3,6), (3,7), (3,8), (4,6), (4,8), (5,6), (5,7), (5,8). (3,6)=0 (row 3, col 6=0), (3,7)=0 (row 3, col 7=0), (3,8)=1 (row 3, col 8=1), (4,6)=0 (row 4, col 6=0), (4,8)=1 (row 4, col 8=1), (5,6)=0 (row 5, col 6=0), (5,7)=1 (row 5, col 7=1), (5,8)=2 (row 5, col 8=2). All these are safe, so (4,7)=0 is correct. The cell (4,8)=1 is already uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is row 5, col 6=0. Adjacent cells are all safe. What about row 2, col 5=0. Adjacent cells are (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0. All safe.\n\nLet's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, which would mean it's safe. For example, row 1, col 6=0 and row 1, col 7=0. Adjacent to these 0s are (1,6)=0's adjacent cells, which include (1,5)=1, (2,5)=0, etc. What about row 2, col 6=0, 7=0, 8=0, 9=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (2,9)=0: adjacent cells (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All these are numbers, so safe.\n\nNow, let's look at row 4, col 9=? which we determined is a mine. So we should flag that. But let's confirm with another angle. (4,8)=1: adjacent cells (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=?, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. (3,7)=0, (4,7)=0 are safe. (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (5,7)=1 are numbers (safe). (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2 are numbers (safe). So (4,8)=1's mine must be (4,9). So (4,9) is a mine.\n\nSimilarly, (2,3)=? is a mine, as we determined earlier.\n\n(10,3)=? is a mine.\n\nNow, we need to find a cell that is safe to uncover. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, which would mean it's safe. For example, row 1, col 6=0 and row 1, col 7=0. The cell (1,8)=1 is already uncovered. What about row 0, col 6=0 and 7=0: their adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is row 3, col 5=0, 6=0, 7=0. These 0s mean their adjacent cells are safe. For example, (3,7)=0: adjacent cells (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1. All safe.\n\nLet's look at row 1, col 0=? and row 1, col 1=?. Let's check (2,0)=2. (2,0)=2: adjacent cells (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F. (3,0)=1 is a number (safe), (3,1)=F is a mine. So (2,0)=2 has 1 mine (3,1) and needs 1 more mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1). We previously thought (2,1) is a mine, so (1,0) and (1,1) are safe. If (2,1) is a mine, then (1,0) and (1,1) are safe. So (1,0) and (1,1) can be uncovered safely.\n\nLet's check (1,0)=?. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?. (0,0)=1: adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1 has 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If (1,0) and (1,1) are safe, then (0,0)=1's mine must be elsewhere, but (0,0)'s adjacent cells are (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,0)=? (safe), (1,1)=? (safe). That can't be. So maybe (1,0) or (1,1) is a mine. This is getting too ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, row 4, col 9 is a mine (needs to be flagged), row 2,3 is a mine (needs to be flagged), row 10,3 is a mine (needs to be flagged). But we need to take an action. The user's current score is 0.5 (5 correct flags). We need to either flag more mines or uncover safe cells.\n\nLet's look for a cell that is a '?' and adjacent to a 0, which would be safe. For example, row 2, col 5=0. Adjacent to (2,5)=0 is (3,4)=1 (row 3, col 4=1). (3,4)=1: adjacent cells (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (3,3)=1, (3,5)=0, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0. (2,4)=1 (safe), (2,5)=0 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe), (3,5)=0 (safe), (4,3)=0 (safe), (4,4)=0 (safe), (4,5)=0 (safe). So (3,4)=1's mine must be (2,3)=? (which we determined is a mine). So (3,4) is safe, but it's already uncovered (it's a 1).\n\nAnother cell: row 1, col 5=1. (1,5)=1: adjacent cells (0,4)=F (mine), (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0. (0,4)=F is a mine, so (1,5)=1's mine count is satisfied. So (1,5) is safe.\n\nLet's look at row 1, col 8=1. (1,8)=1: adjacent cells (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (0,9)=F (mine), (1,7)=0, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (2,9)=0. (0,9)=F is a mine, so (1,8)=1's mine count is satisfied (1 mine). So (1,8) is safe.\n\nNow, let's look for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0s. For example, row 2, col 6=0: adjacent cells (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. All safe.\n\nRow 2, col 7=0: same as above, all adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow 2, col 8=0: adjacent cells (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (2,7)=0, (2,9)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1. All safe.\n\nRow 2, col 9=0: adjacent cells (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (2,8)=0, (2,10)=1, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2. All safe.\n\nNow, let's look at row 4, col 9=? which is a mine. Let's flag that: 'flag (4,9)'. But maybe there's a safer cell to uncover first. Alternatively, let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0 and thus safe.\n\nLooking at row 10, col 3=?, which we think is a mine, but let's check row 10, col 2=1. (10,2)=1: adjacent cells (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,3)=?, (11,1)=0, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1. (9,1)=0, (10,1)=0, (11,1)=0 are safe. (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1 are numbers (safe). So the only possible mine is (10,3), so (10,3) is a mine.\n\nAnother '?' is (0,10). Let's check (0,9)=F (mine). (0,10) is adjacent to (0,9)=F (mine) and (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2. (1,10)=2: adjacent cells (0,9)=F, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?. (2,10)=1: adjacent cells (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1. (3,10)=2: adjacent cells (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0. (4,10)=1: adjacent cells (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,11)=0, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=0. (5,10)=1: adjacent cells (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0, (5,9)=2, (5,11)=0, (6,9)=1, (6,10)=0, (6,11)=0. (6,9)=1: adjacent cells (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F (mine), (6,10)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (7,10)=0. (6,8)=F is a mine, so (6,9)=1's mine count is 1 (from (6,8)), so it's satisfied. (5,10)=1's mine count would be 1, possibly from (4,9)=? (which is a mine). So (4,9)=? is a mine, which we already thought.\n\nGiven that, maybe the safest action is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and thus safe. Let's look for such a cell. For example, row 1, col 6=0 and row 1, col 7=0. The cell (1,6)=0's adjacent cells are all uncovered. What about row 2, col 5=0: adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nAnother 0 is row 3, col 5=0, 6=0, 7=0. These 0s have adjacent cells all uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 4, col 7=0: adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 5, col 6=0: adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 6, col 0=0, 1=0, 5=0, 6=0: adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 7, col 0=0, 1=0, 5=0, 6=0: adjacent cells are all uncovered.\n\nRow 8,9,10,11,12 have 0s and 1s, but their adjacent cells are mostly uncovered.\n\nThe '?' cells that are left are in areas where we can't be sure if they're mines or safe, except for the ones we identified as mines (4,9), (2,3), (10,3). But maybe we can uncover a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 10, col 3=? is adjacent to row 10, col 2=1 and row 10, col 4=1. But those are 1s, not 0s.\n\nWait, let's look at row 1, col 0=? and row 1, col 1=?. Let's check (0,0)=1. (0,0)=1: adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1 has 1 mine in these three. If (1,0) and (1,1) are both safe, then (0,0)=1's mine count would be 0, which is wrong. So one of them must be a mine. But we don't know which.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at row 2, col 1=?. (2,1)=? is adjacent to (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=2, (2,2)=3, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2. (3,1)=F is a mine. (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines in its adjacent cells, which include (2,1)=?. If (2,1) is a mine, that helps satisfy the 3 count. So (2,1) is likely a mine.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best action is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a '?' that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 4, col 9 is a mine, so we shouldn't uncover it. What about row 1, col 11=? and row 1, col 12=?. Let's check row 1, col 10=2. (1,10)=2: adjacent cells (0,9)=F, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?. (2,10)=1: adjacent cells (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=0, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1. (3,10)=2: adjacent cells (2,9)=0, (2,10)=1, (2,11)=?, (3,9)=1, (3,11)=1, (4,9)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0. (4,11)=0: adjacent cells (3,10)=2, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=?, (4,10)=1, (4,12)=?, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=0, (5,12)=0. (5,11)=0: adjacent cells (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0, (4,12)=?, (5,10)=1, (5,12)=0, (6,10)=0, (6,11)=0, (6,12)=0. (6,10)=0, (6,11)=0, (6,12)=0 are all safe, so (5,11)=0's adjacent cells are safe. Therefore, (4,11)=0 is safe, and (4,12)=? is adjacent to (4,11)=0, which is a 0, so (4,12) must be safe (since 0 means no adjacent mines). So (4,12) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nWait, row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? 1 0 0\" so (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0 (since the row ends with 0 0). Oh, row 4's last elements are \"1 0 0\", so (4,10)=1, (4,11)=0, (4,12)=0. So (4,12)=0 is already uncovered. So that's not a '?'.\n\nLet's check row 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" so (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (0,12)=?. (0,12) is adjacent to (0,11)=?, (1,11)=?, (1,12)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 1: \"? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" so (1,11)=?, (1,12)=?. (1,12) is adjacent to (0,11)=?, (0,12)=?, (1,11)=?, (2,11)=?, (2,12)=?. Not helpful.\n\nRow 2: \"2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" so (2,11)=?, (2,12)=?. (2,12) is adjacent to (1,11)=?, (1,12)=?, (2,11)=?, (3,11)=1, (3,12)=?. (3,11)=1 is a number (safe), so (2,12) might be safe, but not sure.\n\nRow 10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" so (10,3)=? is the only '?' there.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best action is to uncover a cell that is adjacent to a 0 and is a '?'. For example, row 2, col 1=? is not adjacent to a 0, but row 1, col 0=? is adjacent to (0,0)=1 and (2,0)=2. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that has a number indicating that all adjacent mines are already flagged, so the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0, col 3=1. (0,3)=1: adjacent cells (0,2)=1, (0,4)=F (mine), (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2. (0,4)=F is a mine, so (0,3)=1's mine count is satisfied (1 mine). Therefore, all other adjacent cells (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) are safe. (0,2)=1 is already uncovered, (1,2)=2 is uncovered, (1,3)=2 is uncovered, (1,4)=2 is uncovered. So no new info.\n\nRow 0, col 8=1: adjacent cells (0,7)=0, (0,9)=F (mine), (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1. (0,9)=F is a mine, so (0,8)=1's mine count is satisfied. All adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nRow 3, col 0=1: adjacent cells (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F (mine), (4,0)=1. (3,1)=F is a mine, so (3,0)=1's mine count is satisfied. (2,0)=2, (4,0)=1 are uncovered, (2,1)=? is unknown.\n\nRow 6, col 7=1: adjacent cells (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,8)=F (mine), (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1. (6,8)=F is a mine, so (6,7)=1's mine count is satisfied. All adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nRow 7, col 2=1: adjacent cells (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,3)=F (mine), (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1. (7,3)=F is a mine, so (7,2)=1's mine count is satisfied. All adjacent cells are uncovered.\n\nAfter analyzing, the cells that are definitely mines are (4,9), (2,3), (10,3), and possibly (2,1). But since we need to take an action, and the user's current score is 0.5, we can try to flag one of the identified mines. For example, (4,9) is a mine, so flagging it would increase the correct flags to 6, score to 0.6.\n\nBut let's confirm (4,9) again. (5,8)=2 has adjacent mines (6,8)=F and (4,9)=?, so (4,9) must be a mine. Yes. So the action should be to flag (4,9).\n\nAnswer: flag (4,9)","flag (4,9)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's understand the current state of the game. The board is 9x9, but the current display shows 13 rows? Wait, maybe that's a formatting issue. Wait, the user probably pasted the board with each row, maybe 13 rows but the actual game is 9x9. Hmm, maybe it's a typo, but let's focus on the given data.\n\nThe score is 0.6, which means 6 correct flags out of 10. Flags are 6\/10, unflags 0. So there are 6 flags that are correct, and 4 flags that are either incorrect (placed on safe cells) or maybe some mines are unflagged. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Let's list each row with their positions (row, col) starting from (0,0) at top-left.\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → columns 0-8: [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1,F] (wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the board's row length? Because 9x9 should have 9 columns per row. Let's check each row's length:\n\nRow 0: \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" → 12 elements. That's odd. Maybe it's a formatting error. Perhaps the actual board is 9x9, and the user's input has some extra spaces or lines. Alternatively, maybe it's a 13x13 board? But the problem statement says 9x9. Maybe it's a mistake, but let's proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is split into parts. Let's assume that the user made a mistake in formatting, and each row is 9 columns. Let's take the first 9 elements of each row.\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1] (since the 9th element is F, then ? ? ? are extra)\nRow 1: [?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1] (next 9)\nRow 2: [2, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 3: [1, F, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]\nRow 4: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1]\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2]\nRow 6: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,F]\nRow 7: [0,0,1,F,1,0,0,1,1]\nRow 8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThat makes a 9x9 grid. Let's confirm:\n\nRow 0: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F, (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1\nRow 1: (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1\nRow 2: (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0\nRow 3: (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1\nRow 4: (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1\nRow 5: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2\nRow 6: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F\nRow 7: (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1\nRow 8: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0\n\nNow, let's analyze some cells. The 'F's are flagged cells. We know 6 are correct, 4 are incorrect. Let's check which F's are likely correct or incorrect.\n\nFirst, look at cells with numbers that have adjacent F's. For example, in row 0, column 4 is F. Let's check the number in (0,3)=1. The cell (0,3) is 1, which means it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,3) are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,3) is (row 0, col 3). Adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,3) has value 1, so exactly 1 mine in those. (0,4) is F, so if that F is a mine, then the other adjacent cells (0,2)=1 (uncover, safe), (1,2)=2 (uncover, safe), (1,3)=2 (uncover, safe), (1,4)=2 (uncover, safe). So if (0,4) is a mine, then (0,3)'s 1 is satisfied. That's possible. So (0,4) F could be correct.\n\nRow 0, column 8 is F (since row 0, columns 0-8: (0,8)=1, but the next element is F? Wait, maybe my initial parsing is wrong. Let me recheck the original board:\n\nOriginal Current Board:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → columns 0-8 would be 1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1 (since 9 elements). Then column 9 is F, 10 is ?, 11 is ?, 12 is ?. But the board is supposed to be 9x9, so perhaps the user made a mistake in the board's display, maybe each row is 9 columns, and the rest are typos. Alternatively, maybe it's a 13x13 board, but the problem states 9x9. This is confusing, but perhaps the key is to focus on the cells that are uncovered and flagged, and find safe cells to uncover.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells that are 0, which when uncovered, automatically uncover all adjacent cells. For example, in row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. So their adjacent cells are safe. Let's check row 0, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells would be (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,6)=0, so all adjacent cells are safe. (0,5)=1 (already uncovered), (0,7)=0 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,6)=0 (uncovered), (1,7)=0 (uncovered). So that's fine.\n\nRow 3, column 1 is F. Let's check the cell (3,0)=1. (3,0) has adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,0)=1, so 1 mine in those. (3,1) is F. If (3,1) is a mine, then (2,0)=2 (uncovered), (2,1)=? (unknown), (4,0)=1 (uncovered), (4,1)=1 (uncovered). So if (3,1) is a mine, then (3,0)'s 1 is satisfied. That's possible. So (3,1) F could be correct.\n\nRow 6, column 8 is F. Let's check (6,7)=1. (6,7) has adjacent cells (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (6,7)=1, so 1 mine there. (6,8)=F. If that's a mine, then the others are (5,6)=0 (uncovered), (5,7)=1 (uncovered), (5,8)=2 (uncovered), (6,6)=0 (uncovered), (7,6)=0 (uncovered), (7,7)=1 (uncovered), (7,8)=1 (uncovered). So 1 mine here would fit. So (6,8) F could be correct.\n\nRow 7, column 3 is F. Let's check (7,2)=1. (7,2) has adjacent cells (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (7,2)=1, so 1 mine here. (7,3)=F. If that's a mine, then (6,1)=0 (uncovered), (6,2)=1 (uncovered), (6,3)=1 (uncovered), (7,1)=0 (uncovered), (8,1)=0 (uncovered), (8,2)=1 (uncovered), (8,3)=1 (uncovered). So 1 mine here would fit. So (7,3) F could be correct.\n\nSo far, we have 4 F's that might be correct: (0,4), (3,1), (6,8), (7,3). The score is 0.6, so 6 correct flags, so there are 2 more correct F's. Let's look for other F's. The original board shows in row 0, there's another F at column 9 (if we consider the original row 0: ... 1 F ? ? ?), but that's beyond 9x9. Maybe the user's board has a mistake, but perhaps in the actual 9x9, there are 6 F's. Let's count the F's in the parsed 9x9:\n\nRow 0, column 4: F → (0,4)\nRow 3, column 1: F → (3,1)\nRow 6, column 8: F → (6,8)\nRow 7, column 3: F → (7,3)\nAre there others? Let's check again:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,1,1,F,1,0,0,1] → F at (0,4)\nRow 1: [?, ?, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1] → no F\nRow 2: [2, ?, 3, ?, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] → no F\nRow 3: [1, F, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1] → F at (3,1)\nRow 4: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1] → no F\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2] → no F\nRow 6: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,F] → F at (6,8)\nRow 7: [0,0,1,F,1,0,0,1,1] → F at (7,3)\nRow 8: [0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0] → no F\n\nSo only 4 F's in the 9x9. But the problem states Flags: 6\/10, so there are 6 F's on the board. That means the initial parsing is wrong. Let's re-examine the original board:\n\nOriginal Current Board:\n\n1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → Maybe this is row 0, columns 0-12. So (0,4)=F, (0,9)=F.\n\n? ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? → row 1, columns 0-12.\n\n2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? → row 2.\n\n1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 → row 3: (3,1)=F.\n\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 → row 4: (4,9)=F.\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 → row 5.\n\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 → row 6: (6,8)=F.\n\n0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 → row 7: (7,3)=F.\n\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row 8.\n\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row 9.\n\n0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row 10: (10,3)=?\n\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row 11.\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row 12.\n\nAh, maybe the user made a mistake and the board is 13x13 instead of 9x9? But the problem says 9x9. Alternatively, it's a formatting error where each row is split. Let's assume that the actual board is 9x9, and the user's input has extra characters. Let's focus on the 9x9 part. Let's list all F's mentioned:\n\nFrom the original board:\n\n- (0,4) → \"1 1 1 1 F ...\"\n- (0,9) → \"1 F ? ? ?\" (but 9 is beyond 8 in 9x9)\n- (3,1) → \"1 F 2 1 ...\"\n- (4,9) → \"1 F 1 0 0\" (row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" → (4,9)=F)\n- (6,8) → \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F ...\" (row 6)\n- (7,3) → \"0 0 1 F 1 ...\" (row 7)\n\nSo that's 6 F's: (0,4), (0,9) [invalid], (3,1), (4,9) [invalid], (6,8), (7,3). But since the board is 9x9, columns 0-8, so (0,9) and (4,9) are invalid. So perhaps the correct F positions are (0,4), (3,1), (4,8) [maybe row 4's F is at (4,8)? Let's check row 4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" → columns 0-8: [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1], so (4,8)=1, then (4,9)=F. So (4,9) is column 9, which is invalid. So maybe the user's board is 10x10 or 13x13, but the problem says 9x9. This is confusing, but perhaps the key is to find a safe cell to uncover.\n\nLet's look for cells that are '?' which are unknown and not flagged. The goal is to uncover safe cells. Let's find a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nLooking at row 2, column 1: (2,1) is '?'. Let's check adjacent cells. The cell (2,0)=2. (2,0) has adjacent cells: (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (2,0)=2, so 2 mines in those. (3,0)=1 (uncovered), (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=2 (uncovered). (1,2)=2 (uncovered). So the adjacent cells to (2,0) are:\n\n(1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2.\n\nSo (2,0) has 2 mines. The flagged cell (3,1) is a possible mine. If (3,1) is a mine (correct flag), then there's 1 mine accounted for, so there's 1 more mine among (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nThe cell (2,2)=3. (2,2) has adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2)=3, so 3 mines here. (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. So the adjacent cells are (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=?, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\nIf (3,1) is a mine (correct), then that's 1 mine. So (2,2) needs 2 more mines among (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (1,3) (but (1,3)=2 is uncovered, so safe). (1,3) is 2, so not a mine. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) could have 2 mines.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look for 0 cells. A 0 cell means all adjacent cells are safe. For example, row 0, column 6 is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 4, column 3 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,4)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0. All uncovered, so safe.\n\nRow 5, column 0-5 are 0s. Their adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 3: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,3)=? (but if it's 9x9, row 10 is invalid). Maybe it's a typo, and the actual board is 9x9, so rows 0-8.\n\nLet's focus on row 2, column 3: (2,3)=? (from row 2: \"2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\"). So (2,3) is unknown. Let's check the cell (2,4)=1. (2,4) has adjacent cells: (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5). (2,4)=1, so 1 mine here. (1,3)=2 (uncovered, safe), (1,4)=2 (uncovered, safe), (1,5)=1 (uncovered, safe), (2,5)=0 (uncovered, safe), (3,3)=1 (uncovered, safe), (3,4)=1 (uncovered, safe), (3,5)=0 (uncovered, safe). So the only unknown adjacent cell is (2,3). Therefore, (2,4)=1 implies that (2,3) must be a mine. Because all other adjacent cells are safe, so the 1 mine must be (2,3). Therefore, (2,3) is a mine. So we should flag it. But wait, the current action options are uncover, flag, unflag.\n\nAlternatively, if (2,3) is a mine, but if we flag it, that's a correct flag. But the user has 6 correct flags already. Wait, the score is 6\/10, so 6 correct flags. So there are 4 mines left to flag. But maybe there's a cell that's safe to uncover.\n\nAnother example: row 1, column 0: (1,0)=?. Let's check (2,0)=2. (2,0) has adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=2, (1,2)=2. So if (3,1) is a correct flag (mine), then (2,0) has 1 mine from (3,1), so it needs 1 more mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nThe cell (1,2)=2. (1,2) has adjacent cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?. So (1,2)=2, which means 2 mines in adjacent cells. The known safe cells are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3). So the mines must be in (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). But (2,2)=3, which is a number, so not a mine. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) could have 2 mines.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, in row 2, column 5 is 0. Its adjacent cells are all safe. (2,5)=0, so (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), (2,6), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6) are all safe. (1,4)=2 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (1,6)=0 (uncovered), (2,4)=1 (uncovered), (2,6)=0 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,6)=0 (uncovered). All safe.\n\nAnother 0 cell is row 3, column 5: 0. Adjacent cells are (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All safe.\n\nLooking for '?' cells that are adjacent to 0 cells. For example, row 1, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All uncovered. So no '?' there.\n\nRow 1, column 7 is 0. Same as above.\n\nRow 4, column 7 is 0. Adjacent cells: (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (4,6)=0, (4,8)=1, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. All uncovered.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,7)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 5 is 0. Adjacent cells: (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=1 (if row 9 exists), but assuming 9x9, row 8 is last. So all adjacent cells are safe.\n\nSo where are the '?' cells? Let's look for '?' in the original board.\n\nOriginal board rows:\n\nRow 0: ... ? ? ? → (0,9), (0,10), (0,11) are ? (invalid)\nRow 1: ... ? ? → (1,10), (1,11) are ? (invalid)\nRow 2: ... ? ? → (2,10), (2,11) are ? (invalid)\nRow 10: 0 0 1 ? 1 ... → (10,3) is ? (invalid)\n\nAssuming the actual 9x9 board, the '?' cells are in the valid rows and columns. Let's check row 1, column 0 and 1: (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?.\n\nRow 2, column 1: (2,1)=?.\n\nRow 2, column 3: (2,3)=?.\n\nThese are the '?' in the 9x9 grid.\n\nLet's take (2,3). Earlier, we saw that (2,4)=1. (2,4) has adjacent cells, and all except (2,3) are safe. So (2,3) must be a mine. Therefore, (2,3) is a mine, so we should flag it. But the current flags are 6\/10, so if we flag (2,3) and it's a mine, that's 7 correct flags. But maybe we can uncover a safe cell.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (1,0). Let's see if it's safe. The cell (2,0)=2. (2,0) has adjacent cells (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2). (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=2, (1,2)=2. If (3,1) is a correct flag (mine), then (2,0) has 1 mine, so 1 more mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1).\n\nThe cell (1,0) is adjacent to (0,0)=1. (0,0)=1 has adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?. (0,0)=1, so 1 mine in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1)=1 is uncovered, so safe (since it's a number, not a mine). So (0,0)=1's mine is either (1,0) or (1,1).\n\nIf (0,0)=1 has 1 mine in (1,0) or (1,1), and (2,0)=2 has 1 mine in (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), then perhaps (1,0) is safe. But this is not certain.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 2, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells are (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,7)=0, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. All safe.\n\nAnother 0 is row 3, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are all safe.\n\nWait, maybe row 1, column 5=1. (1,5) has adjacent cells (0,4)=F, (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (1,4)=2, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0. (1,5)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,4)=F is a possible mine. If (0,4) is a mine, then (1,5)'s 1 is satisfied. So (0,4) F is likely a correct flag.\n\nSince the score is 0.6 (6\/10), and we have 6 flags, 6 are correct. So those 6 flags are on mines. The remaining 4 mines are unflagged. We need to either flag them or uncover all safe cells.\n\nTo uncover a safe cell, we need to find a '?' that is definitely not a mine. Let's consider (2,1)=?. Let's check the cell (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3 has adjacent cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. So (2,2)=3 needs 3 mines. If (3,1)=F is a mine (correct), then that's 1 mine. So 2 more mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (1,3). But (1,3)=2 is a number, so not a mine. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) must have 2 mines.\n\nThe cell (1,2)=2. (1,2)=2 has adjacent cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,3)=2, (2,2)=3. So (1,2)=2 needs 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). Which matches the 2 mines needed for (2,2)=3. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) have exactly 2 mines.\n\nNow, the cell (2,1) is part of both. If we can find another clue. Let's check (1,1)=?. (1,1) is adjacent to (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3. (0,0)=1: 1 mine in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1). (0,1)=1 is a number, so safe. So (0,0)=1's mine is in (1,0) or (1,1).\n\n(0,1)=1: adjacent cells (0,0)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=?, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2. So (0,1)=1 has 1 mine in (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). (1,2)=2 is a number, safe. So mine in (1,0) or (1,1).\n\n(0,2)=1: adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2. So (0,2)=1 has 1 mine in (1,1), (1,2), (1,3). (1,2)=2 and (1,3)=2 are safe, so mine in (1,1).\n\nAh! (0,2)=1's adjacent cells: (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (1,1)=? (unknown), (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe). So (0,2)=1 must have exactly 1 mine, which can only be (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) is a mine.\n\nSo (1,1) is a mine. Therefore, (1,1) should be flagged. But let's confirm:\n\n(0,2)=1: needs 1 mine. The only possible cell is (1,1). So (1,1) is a mine.\n\nNow, going back to (1,2)=2. (1,2)=2 has adjacent mines in (1,1) (mine) and one more in (2,1) or (2,3).\n\n(2,2)=3 has adjacent mines in (3,1) (F, mine), (1,1) (mine), and one more in (2,1) or (2,3). So that's 3 mines, which matches (2,2)=3.\n\nSo (1,1) is a mine. Therefore, (1,1) should be flagged. But the current action could be to flag (1,1), but the user might want to uncover a safe cell.\n\nNow, since (1,1) is a mine, the cell (1,0) could be safe. Let's check (0,0)=1: (0,0) has adjacent cells (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,0)=?, (1,1)=mine. So (0,0)=1's mine is (1,1), so (1,0) is safe. Therefore, (1,0) is safe and can be uncovered.\n\nYes! Because (0,0)=1 requires 1 mine in its adjacent cells. We've determined that (1,1) is a mine, so (1,0) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (1,0) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,0)","uncover (1,0)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, I need to understand the current state of the Minesweeper board. The user provided the current board, which is a 13x9 grid (since there are 13 rows, each with 9 elements). Wait, no, actually, looking at the input, the board is written as rows separated by newlines. Let me count the rows: there are 13 rows listed, each with 9 elements? Let me check:\n\nFirst row: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? — Wait, that's 12 elements. Oh, maybe the formatting is a bit off. Wait, the problem says the board is 9x9, so maybe the user input has a formatting error. Wait, the original Minesweeper is 9x9, so the current board should be 9 rows of 9 cells each. Let me check again. The user's Current Board has 13 lines, which is confusing. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps I should focus on the 9x9 part. Let's assume that the first 9 rows are the 9x9 grid. Let's list them properly:\n\nRow 0: [1, 1, 1, 1, F, 1, 0, 0, 1] (assuming the 'F ? ? ?' is a mistake, maybe a formatting error. Wait, no, maybe the user pasted the board incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the board is presented with each row's cells separated by spaces, and each row is a line. Let's parse each row as a list of cells.\n\nLet me list each row properly (assuming each line is a row, and the cells are space-separated):\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? — That's 12 cells. That can't be right. The problem states it's a 9x9 grid, so perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Maybe the actual board is 9x9, and the extra characters are typos. Let's focus on the 9x9 part. Let's take the first 9 rows, each with 9 cells. Let's correct the rows:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 (assuming the 'F ? ? ?' is a mistake, maybe the first 9 cells)\nRow 1: 1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nThat makes 9 rows, each with 9 cells. That's a 9x9 grid. The user's input probably had some formatting issues with extra characters. Now, the goal is to decide whether to uncover, flag, or unflag a cell. The current score is 0.6, which means 6 correct flags out of 10. The Flags are 6\/10, so there are 6 F's on the board, but some might be incorrect. The Unflags are 0, so no unflags have been done yet.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the win condition is correctly flagging all mines or uncovering all safe cells. The game ends at 100 moves or if a mine is uncovered. The final score is correct flags \/ 10.\n\nSo, the strategy is to uncover safe cells (cells that are definitely not mines) or flag cells that are definitely mines. Let's look at the current board and analyze some cells.\n\nLet's start by looking at cells with 0, as they have no adjacent mines, so all their adjacent cells can be uncovered. For example, in row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. Let's check their adjacent cells. A 0 means all 8 surrounding cells have no mines, so those cells can be safely uncovered. Let's check row 0, column 6 (0-based). Its adjacent cells would be:\n\nRow 0, column 5: 1 (already uncovered)\nRow 0, column 7: 0 (already uncovered)\nRow 1, column 5: 1 (uncovered)\nRow 1, column 6: 0 (uncovered)\nRow 1, column 7: 0 (uncovered)\nSo, maybe 0s in row 0, column 6 and 7 are already processed. Let's look for other 0s.\n\nRow 4, columns 3-5: 0 0 0. So row 4, column 3 is 0. Its adjacent cells: row 3, column 2 (2), row 3, column 3 (1), row 3, column 4 (1), row 4, column 2 (1), row 4, column 4 (0), row 5, column 2 (0), row 5, column 3 (0), row 5, column 4 (0). These are all uncovered, so no new info.\n\nRow 5, columns 0-4: 0 0 0 0 0. So row 5, column 0 is 0. Adjacent cells are row 4, column 0 (1), row 4, column 1 (1), row 5, column 1 (0), row 6, column 0 (0), row 6, column 1 (0). All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, columns 5-8: 1 0 0 0. So row 2, column 6 is 0. Adjacent cells: row 1, column 5 (1), row 1, column 6 (0), row 1, column 7 (0), row 2, column 5 (1), row 2, column 7 (0), row 3, column 5 (0), row 3, column 6 (0), row 3, column 7 (0). All uncovered.\n\nNow, let's look at cells with numbers. For example, row 1, column 1 is '?'. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell at (1,1) is surrounded by:\n\n(0,0):1, (0,1):1, (0,2):1, (1,0):1, (1,2):2, (2,0):2, (2,1):?, (2,2):3.\n\nWait, maybe better to list the known numbers around unknown cells. Let's take an unknown cell and see if we can determine if it's a mine or safe.\n\nLooking at row 1, column 1 (cell (1,1)) which is '?'. Let's check the adjacent cells that are uncovered. The cell (1,1) is in row 1, column 1. Its neighbors are:\n\n(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),\n(1,0),        (1,2),\n(2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nNow, (0,0) is 1, (0,1) is 1, (0,2) is 1, (1,0) is 1, (1,2) is 2, (2,0) is 2, (2,1) is '?', (2,2) is 3.\n\nBut maybe we can use other cells to infer. Let's look at (2,2) which is 3. (2,2) is a 3, so it has 3 mines in its adjacent cells. Let's list the adjacent cells of (2,2):\n\n(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),\n(2,1),        (2,3),\n(3,1), (3,2), (3,3).\n\nWe know:\n\n(1,2) is 2 (uncovered), (1,3) is 2 (from row 1: '1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1' — row 1, column 3 is 2), (2,1) is '?', (2,3) is '?' (row 2: '2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0' — column 3 is '?'), (3,1) is 'F' (row 3: '1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1' — column 1 is F), (3,2) is 2 (column 2), (3,3) is 1 (column 3).\n\nSo the adjacent cells of (2,2) (3) are:\n\n(1,1) '?', (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (2,1) '?', (2,3) '?', (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1.\n\nBut (3,1) is flagged (F). If that F is a correct mine, then that's one mine. The 3 at (2,2) needs 3 mines in total. Let's count known flags in adjacent cells. (3,1) is F. Are there other F's adjacent to (2,2)? Let's check. (3,1) is F, which is adjacent. Any others? (0,4) is F (row 0: '1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1' — column 4 is F). (0,9) is F in the original input, but maybe that's a typo. Let's focus on the 9x9 grid.\n\nIn row 3, column 1 is F. Let's assume that F is a possible mine. If (3,1) is a mine (correct flag), then (2,2) has 1 mine accounted for. So it needs 2 more mines in the remaining adjacent cells: (1,1), (2,1), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2), (3,2), (3,3). But (1,2)=2 is uncovered (so not a mine), (1,3)=2 is uncovered (not a mine), (3,2)=2 is uncovered (not a mine), (3,3)=1 is uncovered (not a mine). So the possible mines for (2,2)'s 3 are (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). So among these three cells, there must be 2 mines (since (3,1) is 1).\n\nNow, let's look at cell (1,2) which is 2. (1,2) is 2, so it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. Let's list its adjacent cells:\n\n(0,1), (0,2), (0,3),\n(1,1),        (1,3),\n(2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n\nWe know (0,1)=1 (uncovered), (0,2)=1 (uncovered), (0,3)=1 (uncovered), (1,3)=2 (uncovered), (2,1)='?', (2,2)=3 (uncovered), (2,3)='?'. So the adjacent cells that could be mines are (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). The 2 at (1,2) requires 2 mines here. From (2,2)=3, we need 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). So (1,2)=2 and (2,2)=3 both require 2 mines in the same set of three cells. That means that exactly 2 of (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) are mines. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) have two mines. \n\nNow, let's look at cell (2,1) which is '?'. Let's check another cell that might relate. Cell (2,0) is 2. (2,0) is 2, so it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(1,0), (1,1), (1,2),\n(2,1),\n(3,0), (3,1), (3,2).\n\nWe know (1,0)=1 (uncovered), (1,2)=2 (uncovered), (3,0)=1 (row 3: '1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1' — column 0 is 1), (3,1)=F (flagged), (3,2)=2 (uncovered). So the adjacent cells that could be mines are (1,1), (2,1). Because (1,0) is 1 (not mine), (1,2) is 2 (not mine), (3,0) is 1 (not mine), (3,1) is F (possible mine), (3,2) is 2 (not mine). So (2,0)=2 has adjacent cells (1,1) and (2,1) as possible mines, plus (3,1)=F. If (3,1) is a mine, then (2,0) needs 2 mines. So (3,1) is 1 mine, so (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine between them (since 1 + 1 = 2). \n\nEarlier, from (1,2)=2 and (2,2)=3, we know that (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) have 2 mines. From (2,0)=2, (1,1) and (2,1) have 1 mine. So combining these: (1,1) + (2,1) = 1 mine, and (1,1) + (2,1) + (2,3) = 2 mines. Therefore, (2,3) must be a mine (since 1 + (2,3) = 2). So (2,3) is a mine. That's a conclusion. So we can flag (2,3).\n\nWait, let's verify. If (2,3) is a mine, then from (1,2)=2, which needs 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (2,3). Since (2,3) is a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine (because 1 + 1 = 2). From (2,0)=2, which needs 2 mines in (1,1), (2,1), (3,1). (3,1) is F (assumed to be a mine), so that's 1 mine. So (1,1) and (2,1) need 1 more mine (1 + 1 = 2). That matches. So (2,3) is a mine. Therefore, we should flag (2,3).\n\nBut wait, let's check other cells to confirm. Let's look at cell (1,3) which is 2 (row 1: '1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1' — column 3 is 2). (1,3)=2, so it has 2 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,2), (0,3), (0,4),\n(1,2),        (1,4),\n(2,2), (2,3), (2,4).\n\nWe know (0,2)=1 (uncovered), (0,3)=1 (uncovered), (0,4)=F (row 0, column 4 is F), (1,2)=2 (uncovered), (1,4)=2 (row 1, column 4 is 2, from '1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1'), (2,2)=3 (uncovered), (2,4)=1 (row 2, column 4 is 1). So the adjacent cells that could be mines are (0,4)=F, (2,3)='?', (1,4)=2 (uncovered, so not mine). (0,4) is F (flagged). If (0,4) is a correct mine, then that's 1 mine. (1,3)=2 needs 2 mines, so there must be 1 more mine in adjacent cells. The remaining possible is (2,3). So (2,3) must be a mine. That confirms our earlier conclusion. So (2,3) is a mine, so we should flag (2,3).\n\nAnother check: cell (2,4) is 1 (row 2: '2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0' — column 4 is 1). (2,4)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells:\n\n(1,3), (1,4), (1,5),\n(2,3),        (2,5),\n(3,3), (3,4), (3,5).\n\nWe know (1,3)=2 (uncovered), (1,4)=2 (uncovered), (1,5)=1 (uncovered), (2,5)=0 (uncovered), (3,3)=1 (uncovered), (3,4)=1 (uncovered), (3,5)=0 (uncovered). So the only possible mine is (2,3) (since it's '?'). So (2,4)=1 requires (2,3) to be a mine. That's a third confirmation. So (2,3) must be a mine. Therefore, the action should be to flag (2,3).\n\nWait, but let's check the current flags. The user's score is 0.6, which is 6\/10 correct flags. So there are 6 correct flags, and 4 incorrect flags (since total flags are 6). But maybe some of the existing F's are incorrect. Let's check existing F's:\n\nLooking at the 9x9 grid:\n\nRow 0, column 4: F (0,4)\nRow 0, column 9: F (but maybe that's a typo, since 9x9 grid has columns 0-8)\nRow 3, column 1: F (3,1)\nRow 4, column 9: F (typo)\nRow 6, column 8: F (6,8)\nRow 7, column 3: F (7,3)\n\nAssuming the 9x9 grid, the F's are at (0,4), (3,1), (6,8), (7,3). That's 4 F's. The user says Flags: 6\/10, so there are 6 F's. Maybe the original input's board has 6 F's. Let's look again at the user's Current Board:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? — So two F's here: (0,4) and (0,8) (since 0-based, columns 0-8, so (0,4) and (0,8))\nRow 1: 1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? — No F's\nRow 2: 2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? — No F's\nRow 3: 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 — F at (3,1)\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 — F at (4,9) which is (4,8) in 0-8? Wait, 9x9 grid columns are 0-8, so (4,8) is F\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 — No F's\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 — F at (6,8)\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 — F at (7,3)\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 — No F's\nRows 9-12: Probably extra, so the 9x9 grid has F's at (0,4), (0,8), (3,1), (4,8), (6,8), (7,3) — that's 6 F's, which matches Flags: 6\/10. So 6 flags placed.\n\nNow, the score is 0.6, meaning 6 correct flags. So all 6 current flags are correct? Or 6 correct out of 6 flagged. The score is correct flags \/ total mines (10). So 6 correct flags, 4 remaining mines unflagged. So the 6 current F's are correct. That's possible. So (0,4), (0,8), (3,1), (4,8), (6,8), (7,3) are correct mines.\n\nNow, back to (2,3). If (2,3) is a mine, then it's one of the remaining 4 mines. So we should flag it. Let's confirm again with (1,3)=2. (1,3) is 2, adjacent cells include (0,4)=F (correct mine) and (2,3). So (0,4) is 1 mine, so (2,3) must be the second mine. Therefore, (2,3) is a mine, so flagging (2,3) would increase correct flags to 7, improving the score.\n\nAnother cell to check: row 2, column 1 is '?'. Let's see if we can determine if it's safe. From earlier, (2,0)=2 has adjacent mines: (3,1)=F (correct mine), and one of (1,1) or (2,1). Since (2,0)=2 needs 2 mines, and (3,1) is one, then either (1,1) or (2,1) is a mine. But from (1,2)=2 and (2,2)=3, we know that (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) have 2 mines. Since (2,3) is a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) have 1 mine. So either (1,1) or (2,1) is a mine, but not both.\n\nBut maybe there's a safe cell to uncover. Let's look for cells that are definitely safe. For example, row 1, column 1 is '?'. Is it safe? Let's see. If (1,1) is a mine, then (2,1) is not (since (1,1) + (2,1) = 1). If (1,1) is not a mine, then (2,1) is a mine. But we can't be sure. What about other '?' cells?\n\nLooking at row 2, column 1: '?'. If (2,1) is a mine, then (1,1) is safe, and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for 0 cells that might have adjacent '?' cells. For example, row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. Their adjacent cells are all uncovered. Row 4, column 3-5 are 0, adjacent cells are uncovered. Row 5, column 0-4 are 0, adjacent cells are uncovered. Row 2, column 5-8 are 0, adjacent cells are uncovered. So no 0 cells with adjacent '?' cells left.\n\nAnother approach: look for cells with numbers that have all adjacent mines already flagged, meaning the remaining adjacent cells are safe. For example, cell (0,0) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,1)=1, (1,0)=1, (1,1)=?. The 1 at (0,0) means there's 1 mine in adjacent cells. If none of the adjacent cells are flagged, then the '?' at (1,1) could be the mine. But (0,0) has adjacent cells: (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,0)=1 (safe), (1,1)=? (unknown). So (0,0)=1 has 1 mine in those three. If (1,1) is the mine, then (0,0) is satisfied. But we don't know yet.\n\nAlternatively, cell (1,0) is 1. Adjacent cells: (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?. (1,0)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0)=1 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,1)=?, (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=?. So one of (1,1) or (2,1) is a mine. Which we already knew.\n\nAlternatively, let's look at cell (7,3) which is F (flagged). It's in row 7, column 3. Let's check its adjacent cells. (7,3) is flagged as a mine. Let's see if that's correct. For example, cell (6,2)=1 (row 6: '0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F' — column 2 is 1). (6,2)=1 has adjacent cells: (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,3)=1, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F. So (6,2)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (7,3)=F is adjacent, so if that's a mine, then (6,2)=1 is satisfied. That's correct. So (7,3) is a correct flag.\n\nSimilarly, cell (6,8)=F (row 6, column 8). Let's check cell (5,7)=1 (row 5: '0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2' — column 7 is 1). (5,7)=1 has adjacent cells: (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1 (row 4, column 8 is 1), (5,6)=0, (5,8)=2, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F. So (5,7)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (6,8)=F is adjacent, so that's a correct mine. So (6,8) is correct.\n\nCell (4,8)=F (row 4, column 8). Check cell (3,8)=1 (row 3: '1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1' — column 8 is 1). (3,8)=1 has adjacent cells: (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0, (3,7)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=F, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2. So (3,8)=1 has 1 mine, which is (4,8)=F. Correct.\n\nCell (3,1)=F (row 3, column 1). Check cell (2,0)=2 (row 2, column 0 is 2). (2,0)=2 has adjacent cells: (1,0)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2. So (3,1)=F is a mine, contributing to (2,0)=2's 2 mines. Correct.\n\nCell (0,8)=F (row 0, column 8). Check cell (0,7)=0 (row 0, column 7 is 0). (0,7)=0 has adjacent cells: (0,6)=0, (0,8)=F, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. Since (0,7)=0, all adjacent cells are safe, but (0,8)=F is adjacent. That would be a problem because (0,7)=0 can't have a mine adjacent. Wait, (0,7)=0 means no mines in adjacent cells. (0,7) is at row 0, column 7. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(0,6), (0,8),\n(1,6), (1,7), (1,8).\n\n(0,6)=0, (0,8)=F, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. So (0,7)=0 has (0,8)=F as an adjacent cell. But 0 means no mines adjacent, so (0,8)=F must be an incorrect flag! Because if (0,8) were a mine, then (0,7) would have a mine adjacent, but (0,7) is 0. Therefore, (0,8)=F is a wrong flag. That's a problem. The user's score is 0.6, which is 6\/10, so there are 6 correct flags and 4 incorrect. Since (0,8)=F is adjacent to a 0, it must be a wrong flag. So that's one incorrect flag.\n\nSimilarly, cell (0,4)=F (row 0, column 4). Let's check cell (0,3)=1 (row 0, column 3 is 1). (0,3)=1 has adjacent cells: (0,2)=1, (0,4)=F, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2. So (0,3)=1 has 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,4)=F is adjacent, so if that's a mine, then (0,3)=1 is satisfied. Let's check cell (1,4)=2 (row 1, column 4 is 2). (1,4)=2 has adjacent cells: (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F, (0,5)=1, (1,3)=2, (1,5)=1, (2,3)=?, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0. So (1,4)=2 has 2 mines. (0,4)=F is one, so there's 1 more mine. Possible candidates: (2,3)=? (which we think is a mine). So (0,4)=F is a correct flag, as (0,3)=1 requires it, and (1,4)=2 also uses it. So (0,4)=F is correct.\n\nSo (0,8)=F is incorrect. That's one of the 4 incorrect flags. So the user has 5 correct flags (since 6 total, 1 incorrect), but the score is 0.6, which is 6\/10. So maybe my assumption is wrong. The score is correct flags \/ 10, so 6 correct flags, regardless of how many are flagged. So even if 6 are flagged, but 6 are correct, and 4 are unflagged, that's 0.6. So the 6 flagged could include some incorrect ones, but the correct ones are 6. For example, if 8 are flagged, 6 correct and 2 incorrect, the score is 6\/10. But the user's Flags are 6\/10, meaning 6 flagged, 10 total mines. So 6 flagged, 4 unflagged. The score is 6\/10, so all 6 flagged are correct. Therefore, (0,8)=F must be correct, but (0,7)=0 is adjacent. That's a contradiction. So there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, (0,7) is 0. Its adjacent cells are (0,6)=0, (0,8)=1 (row 0: '1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?' — maybe column 8 is 1, not F. Oh! I think I misread the row 0. Let's re-express the Current Board correctly, considering that each row has 9 cells (columns 0-8):\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 (columns 0-8)\nRow 1: 1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 ? 3 ? 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nAh, that makes more sense. So row 0, column 8 is 1, not F. The user's input had a typo, with 'F ? ? ?' at the end, which are extra. So the 9x9 grid has F's at:\n\nRow 0, column 4: F (0,4)\nRow 3, column 1: F (3,1)\nRow 6, column 8: F (6,8)\nRow 7, column 3: F (7,3)\n\nThat's 4 F's. But the user says Flags: 6\/10. So maybe the original board has 6 F's, and the user's input formatting is incorrect. This is a problem. Given the ambiguity, perhaps I should focus on the logical conclusion that (2,3) is a mine and flag it. Alternatively, maybe there's a safe cell to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe. For example, cell (1,1) is '?'. Let's see if we can determine if it's safe. From cell (2,0)=2, which has adjacent cells (1,0)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (2,1)=?, (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2. (3,1)=F is a mine (correct flag), so (2,0)=2 needs 1 more mine in (1,1) or (2,1). From cell (1,2)=2, which has adjacent cells (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=?. (1,2)=2 needs 2 mines in these. (2,2)=3 is a number, so not a mine. (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,3) are numbers, so not mines. So (1,1), (2,1), (2,3) must have 2 mines. From (2,0)=2, (1,1) or (2,1) has 1 mine. So (2,3) must have 1 mine (since 1 + 1 = 2). Therefore, (2,3) is a mine, so flag it.\n\nThus, the action should be to flag (2,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (2,3)","flag (2,3)","Okay, let's try to figure out what action to take next. First, let's understand the current state of the game. The board is a 9x9 grid, but the given current board has 13 rows, which might be a typo, but maybe it's a 13x9 grid? Wait, the problem says 9x9, so perhaps the current board is presented in a way that's split into lines. Let me check again. The input shows rows from 0 to 12, but the Minesweeper is 9x9, so maybe that's a formatting error. Maybe it's a 9x13 grid? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in the board display. But regardless, I need to focus on the rules and the current state.\n\nThe score is 0.7, which means 7 correct flags out of 10. Flags are 7\/10, unflags 0. So there are 7 flags placed, 3 of which might be incorrect (since total mines are 10, correct flags are 7, so 3 flags are wrong, and 3 mines are unflagged). The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The game ends at 100 epochs or if a mine is uncovered.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's parse the rows. Let's list the rows with their indices:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → Assuming columns 0-12, but 9x9 should be 0-8. Maybe the board is presented as multiple lines per row? Or perhaps it's a 13x9 grid. Hmm, maybe the problem statement has a mistake, but let's proceed.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the coordinate of the top-leftmost grid is (0, 0)\", so (row, col). Let's assume each row in the current board is a row of the grid, and each element is a column. Let's index the rows as 0 to 12 and columns 0 to 12, but the actual game is 9x9, so maybe rows 0-8 and columns 0-8. The rest might be typos. Let's focus on the 9x9 part.\n\nLooking at the board, let's check the cells that are uncovered (numbers or 0), flagged (F), or unknown (?).\n\nFirst, the safe cells are the ones with numbers or 0. Uncovering a 0 cell would automatically uncover adjacent cells until a non-zero is hit, but in the current board, some 0s are already uncovered.\n\nThe flagged cells are marked with F. We need to check if these Fs are correctly placed (mines) or not. Since the score is 0.7, 7 Fs are correct, 3 are incorrect.\n\nLet's look for cells that must be mines or must be safe. For example, if a cell with a number has a certain number of adjacent unknown cells, and the number equals the count of adjacent Fs plus the remaining unknowns, then those unknowns must be mines. Or if the number is less than the adjacent Fs, then some Fs are incorrect.\n\nLet's take row 0, column 4: F. Let's check its neighbors. The cell at (0,4) is F. Let's look at the surrounding cells. For example, cell (0,3) is 1. The cell (0,3) has value 1, which means there's 1 mine in its 8 adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,3) are:\n\n(0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4).\n\n(0,2) is 1 (uncovered), (0,4) is F (flagged), (1,2) is ?, (1,3) is 2 (uncovered), (1,4) is 2 (uncovered). Wait, (0,3) is 1. So the 8 adjacent cells are:\n\nRow-1: (0-1,3-1) to (0-1,3+1) → invalid (row -1), so no.\n\nRow 0: (0,2), (0,4)\n\nRow 1: (1,2), (1,3), (1,4)\n\nSo the adjacent cells are (0,2)=1, (0,4)=F, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2. Wait, (0,3) is at (row 0, col 3). The 8 adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1): (-1,2) invalid\n\n(row-1, col): (-1,3) invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1): (-1,4) invalid\n\n(row, col-1): (0,2) =1\n\n(row, col+1): (0,4) =F\n\n(row+1, col-1): (1,2) =?\n\n(row+1, col): (1,3) =2\n\n(row+1, col+1): (1,4) =2\n\nSo the adjacent cells are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The cell (0,3) has value 1, meaning there's 1 mine in these 5 cells. Currently, (0,4) is flagged as F (mine). So if (0,4) is a mine, then the remaining adjacent cells (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) must have 0 mines. (0,2) is 1, which is an uncovered cell (so safe), (1,3)=2 and (1,4)=2 are uncovered (safe). So (1,2) is ?, which must be safe. Therefore, (1,2) can be uncovered.\n\nAnother example: row 2, column 3 is F. Let's check cell (2,2) which is 3. (2,2) has value 3, so 3 mines in adjacent cells. Adjacent cells to (2,2) (row 2, col 2):\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (1,1)=?\n\n(row-1, col)= (1,2)=?\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (1,3)=2 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (2,1)=?\n\n(row, col+1)= (2,3)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (3,1)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col)= (3,2)=2 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (3,3)=1 (safe)\n\nSo the adjacent cells are (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (1,3)=2, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1. The value is 3, so total mines here should be 3. Currently, there are 2 Fs ( (2,3) and (3,1) ). So if those are both mines, then we need 1 more mine in the remaining adjacent ? cells: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So one of those must be a mine. But let's see other cells that might relate.\n\nCell (3,1) is F. Let's check cell (3,0) which is 1. (3,0) has value 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (2,-1) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (2,0)=2 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (2,1)=?\n\n(row, col-1)= (3,-1) invalid\n\n(row, col+1)= (3,1)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (4,-1) invalid\n\n(row+1, col)= (4,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (4,1)=1 (safe)\n\nSo adjacent cells are (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F, (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1. The value is 1, so 1 mine here. If (3,1) is a mine, then the rest (2,1), (2,0), etc., must have 0. (2,0)=2 is safe, (4,0)=1 and (4,1)=1 are safe, so (2,1) must be safe. So (2,1) is safe, so it can be uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 3: ?. The cell (10,3) is in row 10, col 3. Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell above it is row 9, col 3: 1. Row 9, col 3 is 1. Its adjacent cells would include (10,3). If (9,3)=1, then the number of mines around it is 1. Let's see (9,3)'s adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (8,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (8,3)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (8,4)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (9,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (9,4)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (10,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (10,3)=?\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (10,4)=1 (safe)\n\nSo (9,3) is surrounded by all 1s and (10,3)=?. The value is 1, so there's 1 mine in these 8 cells. All the other adjacent cells (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (9,2), (9,4), (10,2), (10,4) are uncovered (safe), so the only possible mine is (10,3). Wait, but (9,3) is 1, which means exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. If all adjacent cells except (10,3) are safe, then (10,3) must be a mine. But wait, (10,3) is ?, so if that's the case, we should flag it. But let's confirm.\n\nWait, (9,3) is 1. Let's list all 8 adjacent cells:\n\n(8,2): 1 (safe)\n\n(8,3): 1 (safe)\n\n(8,4): 1 (safe)\n\n(9,2): 1 (safe)\n\n(9,4): 1 (safe)\n\n(10,2): 1 (safe)\n\n(10,3): ?\n\n(10,4): 1 (safe)\n\nAll these cells except (10,3) are uncovered and safe (since they have numbers, which are not mines). So the only possible mine adjacent to (9,3) is (10,3). Therefore, (10,3) must be a mine. So we should flag it. But wait, our current flags are 7\/10, and we need to flag all 10. If (10,3) is a mine, flagging it would increase correct flags to 8. But let's check if there's a cell that is definitely safe to uncover.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for cells that are unknown (?) and are definitely safe. For example, in row 0, column 10: ?. Let's see the cell (0,9) which is 1. (0,9) has value 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (-1,8) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (-1,9) invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (-1,10) invalid\n\n(row, col-1)= (0,8)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (0,10)=?\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (1,8)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (1,9)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (1,10)=2 (safe)\n\nSo adjacent cells are (0,8)=1, (0,10)=?, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2. The value is 1, so 1 mine here. (0,8) is safe, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2 are all safe (uncovered). So the only possible mine is (0,10). So (0,10) is a mine? Then it should be flagged. But maybe not. Let's check another cell.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 7: 0. A 0 cell means no mines in adjacent cells. So all adjacent cells to (0,7) are safe. (0,7) is 0. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (-1,6) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (-1,7) invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (-1,8) invalid\n\n(row, col-1)= (0,6)=0 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (0,8)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (1,6)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (1,7)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (1,8)=1 (safe)\n\nAll these are safe, which matches the 0, so nothing new here.\n\nRow 4, column 9: F. Let's check cell (4,8) which is 1. (4,8) has value 1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (3,7)=0 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (3,8)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (3,9)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (4,7)=0 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (4,9)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (5,7)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (5,8)=2 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (5,9)=2 (safe)\n\nSo (4,8) has adjacent cells with (4,9)=F. The value is 1, so if (4,9) is a mine, then the rest are safe, which they are. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 6, column 8: F. Let's check cell (6,7)=1. (6,7)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (5,6)=0 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (5,7)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (5,8)=2 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (6,6)=0 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (6,8)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (7,6)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (7,7)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (7,8)=1 (safe)\n\nSo (6,7) has value 1. If (6,8) is a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nRow 7, column 3: F. Let's check cell (7,2)=1. (7,2)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (6,1)=0 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (6,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (6,3)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (7,1)=0 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (7,3)=F (flagged)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (8,1)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (8,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (8,3)=1 (safe)\n\nSo (7,2)=1, adjacent to (7,3)=F. If (7,3) is a mine, that's 1, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nSo far, the Fs at (0,4), (0,9), (2,3), (3,1), (4,9), (6,8), (7,3) are 7 flags. Since the score is 0.7, 7 are correct. So 3 of these are incorrect. Let's find which ones.\n\nLet's take (2,3)=F. Check cell (2,4)=1. (2,4) is 1. Its adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (1,3)=2 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (1,4)=2 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (1,5)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (2,3)=F (flagged)\n\n(row, col+1)= (2,5)=0 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (3,3)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (3,4)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (3,5)=0 (safe)\n\nSo (2,4)=1. The adjacent cells include (2,3)=F. So if (2,3) is a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So (2,3) could be correct.\n\nCheck (3,1)=F. Cell (3,0)=1. (3,0) adjacent cells: (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F, (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe). (3,0)=1, so if (3,1) is a mine, then (2,1) must be safe. Let's check (2,1)=?.\n\nCell (1,1)=?. Let's check cell (1,0)=1. (1,0)=1. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (0,-1) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (0,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (0,1)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (1,-1) invalid\n\n(row, col+1)= (1,1)=?\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (2,-1) invalid\n\n(row+1, col)= (2,0)=2 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (2,1)=?\n\nSo (1,0)=1. Adjacent cells are (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?. The value is 1, so 1 mine here. (0,0)=1 and (0,1)=1 are safe (uncovered), (2,0)=2 is safe. So either (1,1) or (2,1) is a mine. But earlier, from (3,0)=1, we thought (2,1) is safe. If (3,1)=F is a mine, then (2,1) is safe, so (1,1) must be the mine for (1,0)=1. But (1,1) is ?, so maybe.\n\nAlternatively, if (3,1)=F is not a mine (incorrect flag), then (3,0)=1's mine could be in (2,1). Let's see cell (2,0)=2. (2,0)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (1,-1) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (1,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (1,1)=?\n\n(row, col-1)= (2,-1) invalid\n\n(row, col+1)= (2,1)=?\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (3,-1) invalid\n\n(row+1, col)= (3,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (3,1)=F (flagged)\n\nSo (2,0)=2. The adjacent cells are (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F. So 2 mines here. If (3,1)=F is a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. If (3,1) is not a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 2 mines. But (1,0)=1 has adjacent cells (1,1) and (2,1), so if (1,0)=1, then (1,1) and (2,1) can have at most 1 mine. So if (3,1) is not a mine, then (2,0)=2 requires (1,1) and (2,1) to have 2 mines, which conflicts with (1,0)=1 needing 1 mine. Therefore, (3,1)=F must be a mine (correct flag), so (2,0)=2 has 1 mine in (1,1) and (2,1), and (1,0)=1 has 1 mine in (1,1) and (2,1). So (1,1) and (2,1) have exactly 1 mine.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe instead of checking flags, look for safe cells to uncover. The safest cells are 0 cells, but all 0s are already uncovered. Next, cells adjacent to 0s. For example, row 0, column 6 and 7 are 0. Their adjacent cells (row 0,8)=1, row 1,6=0, row 1,7=0, etc., which are already uncovered.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 3: ?. Earlier, we thought (9,3)=1, which has all adjacent cells except (10,3) as safe, so (10,3) must be a mine. But let's confirm. (9,3)=1, so 1 mine in adjacent cells. All adjacent cells except (10,3) are uncovered (safe), so (10,3) is a mine. Therefore, (10,3) should be flagged. But we have 3 incorrect flags, so maybe there's a cell that's definitely safe.\n\nAlternatively, look at row 1, column 1: ?. Let's check cell (1,2)=2. (1,2)=2. Adjacent cells:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (0,1)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col)= (0,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (0,3)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col-1)= (1,1)=?\n\n(row, col+1)= (1,3)=2 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (2,1)=?\n\n(row+1, col)= (2,2)=3 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (2,3)=F (flagged)\n\nSo (1,2)=2. The adjacent cells are (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=F. So 2 mines here. (2,3)=F is a flag. If (2,3) is a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. If (2,3) is not a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 2 mines. But earlier, (2,2)=3 has adjacent cells (1,1)=?, (1,2)=?, (2,1)=?, (2,3)=F, (3,1)=F. (2,2)=3, so 3 mines. If (2,3) and (3,1) are mines (2), then (1,1) and (1,2) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. (1,2)=2 is safe, so (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. Which matches (1,2)=2 needing 1 mine in (1,1) and (2,1) if (2,3) is a mine. So this is consistent.\n\nMaybe the best move is to uncover a cell that is definitely safe. Let's look for a ? that is adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 7=1. Its adjacent cells: (4,6)=0 (safe), (4,7)=0 (safe), (4,8)=1 (safe), (5,6)=0 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (6,6)=0 (safe), (6,7)=1 (safe), (6,8)=F (flagged). So (5,7)=1, which has 1 mine. (6,8)=F is a flag. If that's a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So (5,7) is safe.\n\nAnother cell: row 1, column 1=?. Let's see if it's safe. From (1,0)=1, which has adjacent cells (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=?, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?. (1,0)=1, so 1 mine in these. (0,0) and (0,1) are safe, (2,0)=2 is safe. So (1,1) or (2,1) is a mine. But (2,0)=2 has adjacent cells (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F. (3,1)=F is a mine (as per earlier), so (2,0)=2 needs 2 mines. If (3,1) is a mine, then (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. So (1,1) and (2,1) have 1 mine between them. So (1,1) has a 50% chance of being a mine, but we can't be sure.\n\nWhat about row 0, column 10=?. Let's check cell (0,9)=1. (0,9)=1 has adjacent cells (0,8)=1, (0,10)=?, (1,8)=1, (1,9)=1, (1,10)=2. (0,9)=1, so 1 mine here. (0,8), (1,8), (1,9), (1,10) are safe, so (0,10) is a mine. So (0,10) should be flagged. But we have 7 flags, so maybe flagging it would help, but the score is 0.7, so 7 correct. If (0,10) is a mine, flagging it would make 8 correct. But maybe there's a cell that's safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at row 10, column 3=?. If (9,3)=1 and all adjacent cells except (10,3) are safe, then (10,3) is a mine. So (10,3) should be flagged. But maybe the user wants to uncover a safe cell. Let's find a cell that's definitely safe.\n\nRow 2, column 1=?. Let's check cell (2,0)=2. (2,0)=2 has adjacent cells (1,1)=?, (2,1)=?, (3,1)=F. (3,1)=F is a mine (correct), so (2,0)=2 needs 2 mines. So (1,1) and (2,1) must have 1 mine. So (2,1) could be safe or a mine.\n\nRow 1, column 1=?. From (1,0)=1, which needs 1 mine in (1,1) or (2,1). If (2,1) is a mine, then (1,1) is safe. If (1,1) is a mine, then (2,1) is safe. So either way, one of them is safe, but we don't know which.\n\nRow 0, column 11=?. Let's check cell (0,10)=? (which we think is a mine). Cell (0,11)=? is adjacent to (0,10)=? and (1,10)=2. (1,10)=2 has adjacent cells (0,9)=1, (0,10)=?, (0,11)=?, (1,9)=1, (1,11)=?, (2,9)=1, (2,10)=?, (2,11)=?. (1,10)=2, so 2 mines here. If (0,10) is a mine, then (0,11) or (1,11) or (2,10) or (2,11) could be the other mine. Not helpful.\n\nMaybe the safest move is to uncover a cell that's adjacent to a 0. For example, row 5, column 5=0. Its adjacent cells are all 0 or 1, which are already uncovered. So no.\n\nRow 4, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,6)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 3, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,6)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 2, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (2,4)=1, (2,6)=0, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 6=0. Adjacent cells are (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (1,5)=1, (1,7)=0, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 1, column 7=0. Adjacent cells are (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,8)=1, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 6, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (6,4)=1, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 7, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (7,4)=1, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nRow 8, column 5=0. Adjacent cells are (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (8,4)=1, (8,6)=0, (9,4)=1, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0. All uncovered.\n\nSo all 0 cells are already uncovered, and their adjacent cells are uncovered. The next step is to look for cells with numbers that have known mine counts, allowing us to uncover adjacent ? cells.\n\nLet's take cell (4,8)=1. Its adjacent cells are (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1, (3,9)=1, (4,7)=0, (4,9)=F, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2. (4,8)=1, and (4,9)=F is a flag. If (4,9) is a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So (4,8) is safe.\n\nCell (5,8)=2. Its adjacent cells are (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1, (4,9)=F, (5,7)=1, (5,9)=2, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1. (5,8)=2. The flags here are (4,9) and (6,8). If both are mines, then that's 2, which matches. So (5,8) is safe.\n\nCell (6,9)=1. Adjacent cells: (5,8)=2, (5,9)=2, (5,10)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,10)=0, (7,8)=1, (7,9)=1, (7,10)=0. (6,9)=1. If (6,8)=F is a mine, then the count is 1, which matches. So safe.\n\nCell (7,8)=1. Adjacent cells: (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F, (6,9)=1, (7,7)=1, (7,9)=1, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0, (8,9)=0. (7,8)=1. If (6,8)=F is a mine, count is 1, matches. Safe.\n\nCell (8,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (8,1)=0, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1. (8,2)=1. If (7,3)=F is a mine, count is 1, matches. Safe.\n\nCell (9,2)=1. Adjacent cells: (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (9,1)=0, (9,3)=1, (10,1)=0, (10,2)=1, (10,3)=?. (9,2)=1. The adjacent cells are all safe except (10,3)=?. (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (9,1), (9,3), (10,1), (10,2) are all uncovered and safe. So (9,2)=1 must have its mine in (10,3). So (10,3) is a mine, so flag it. But we need to check if that's a good move.\n\nAlternatively, let's look for a cell that is ? and has a neighbor with a number that equals the number of adjacent flags, meaning the ? is safe. For example, cell (1,1)=?. Let's check its neighbor (0,1)=1. (0,1)=1 has adjacent cells (0,0)=1, (0,2)=1, (1,0)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2. (0,1)=1. The adjacent flags: none. So 1 mine in these cells. (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2) are safe, so (1,1)=? is a mine. Wait, no. (0,1)=1's adjacent cells are:\n\n(row-1, col-1)= (-1,0) invalid\n\n(row-1, col)= (-1,1) invalid\n\n(row-1, col+1)= (-1,2) invalid\n\n(row, col-1)= (0,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row, col+1)= (0,2)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col-1)= (1,0)=1 (safe)\n\n(row+1, col)= (1,1)=?\n\n(row+1, col+1)= (1,2)=2 (safe)\n\nSo (0,1)=1 has adjacent cells (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2). All except (1,1) are safe. So (1,1) must be a mine. Oh! That's a key point. (0,1) is 1, which means exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (1,0)=1 (safe), (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2 (safe). All of these except (1,1) are uncovered (safe), so the only possible mine is (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) must be a mine. So we should flag (1,1).\n\nWait, let's confirm. (0,1) is at row 0, column 1. Its 8 adjacent cells are:\n\nTop-left: (0-1,1-1) = (-1,0) invalid\n\nTop: (0-1,1) = (-1,1) invalid\n\nTop-right: (0-1,1+1) = (-1,2) invalid\n\nLeft: (0,1-1) = (0,0) = 1 (safe)\n\nRight: (0,1+1) = (0,2) = 1 (safe)\n\nBottom-left: (0+1,1-1) = (1,0) = 1 (safe)\n\nBottom: (0+1,1) = (1,1) = ?\n\nBottom-right: (0+1,1+1) = (1,2) = 2 (safe)\n\nSo the only adjacent cell that's not uncovered is (1,1). Since (0,1) has a value of 1, there must be exactly 1 mine in its adjacent cells. All other adjacent cells are safe (uncovered), so (1,1) must be the mine. Therefore, (1,1) should be flagged.\n\nBut wait, our current flags are 7\/10. If (1,1) is a mine, flagging it would make 8 correct flags. But let's check if there's a cell that's definitely safe to uncover. For example, cell (2,1)=?.\n\nFrom (0,1)=1, we know (1,1) is a mine. Now, let's look at cell (1,0)=1. (1,0) has adjacent cells (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (1,1)=mine (now known), (2,0)=2, (2,1)=?. The value is 1, so there's 1 mine in these. We already have (1,1) as a mine, so the rest must be safe. Therefore, (2,1) must be safe. So (2,1) can be uncovered.\n\nYes! That's a safe move. Let's verify:\n\n(1,0) is 1. Its adjacent cells are (0,0)=1 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (1,1)=mine (flagged), (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=?. Since (1,0)=1, there's 1 mine in these cells. We've identified (1,1) as the mine, so (2,1) must be safe. Therefore, uncovering (2,1) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,1)","uncover (2,1)","Okay, let's try to figure out the best move here. First, let's recall the Minesweeper rules. The goal is to either flag all 10 mines correctly or uncover all safe cells. The current score is 0.7, which means 7 correct flags out of 10. The board provided is a 9x9 grid? Wait, looking at the current board, the rows are numbered from 0 to 12? Wait, the initial description says the board is 9x9, but the current board here has 13 rows. Maybe that's a formatting mistake, but perhaps it's a typo and the rows are 0-8. Let me check the input again.\n\nWait, the problem statement says the board is a 9x9 grid. So maybe the current board display is split into lines, perhaps each line represents a row, but maybe the user inputted it with line breaks. Let's count the rows: the current board has 13 lines, but that can't be right. Maybe each line is a row, but perhaps the user made a mistake. Let's assume that the board is 9x9, so rows 0-8. Let's look at the data:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? — maybe this is row 0, columns 0-8, and the rest are typos. Or perhaps the user inputted the board with some line wrapping. Alternatively, maybe it's a 13x13 board, but the problem statement says 9x9. Hmm, perhaps the board is displayed with each row as a line, and the numbers are the cells. Let's focus on the cells that are visible and try to find safe moves.\n\nFirst, let's list out the current state. Let's consider that each row in the \"Current Board\" is a row of the grid, with each cell separated by spaces. Let's index rows from 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows), and columns 0 to 12 (since some rows have 13 cells). But the problem says 9x9, so maybe it's a mistake, but we have to work with what's given.\n\nThe user's task is to output an action: uncover, flag, or unflag. Let's look for cells that are unknown (marked as '?') and determine if they are safe to uncover or if they must be mines.\n\nFirst, let's list the flagged cells (marked as 'F'). The score is 7\/10, so 7 correct flags, 3 incorrect. So some F's are wrong. We need to find which F's are incorrect or which ?'s are mines.\n\nLet's look at each row and column with F's and numbers to see if we can deduce.\n\nLet's take row 0: cells (0,4)=F, (0,8)=F. Let's check the adjacent numbers. For example, (0,3) is 1. The cell (0,3) is a number 1, which means it has 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,3) are (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). (0,3) is 1, so among these 5 cells, there's 1 mine. (0,4) is F (flagged as mine). If (0,4) is a correct mine, then the other adjacent cells (0,2), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) must be safe. Let's check (1,3)=2. (1,3) is 2, so adjacent cells: (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (1,3)=2. If (0,4) is a mine (so 1 mine here), then the remaining 1 mine must be in the other adjacent cells. Let's see (2,3)=F (row 2, column 3 is F). So (2,3) is another F. Let's check (2,2)=3. (2,2)=3, adjacent cells include (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (2,2)=3, so 3 mines here. (2,3) is F, so if that's a mine, then two more mines in the other adjacent cells. (3,1)=F (row 3, column 1 is F). Let's check (3,0)=1. (3,0)=1, adjacent cells: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (3,0)=1, so 1 mine here. (3,1) is F, so if that's a mine, then the others are safe. (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, which would make sense if (3,1) is a mine.\n\nRow 6, column 8 is F (row 6: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0\" so (6,8)=F). Row 7, column 3 is F (row7: \"0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\" so (7,3)=F). Row 4, column 9 is F (row4: \"1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0\" so (4,9)=F).\n\nSo total F's: Let's count:\n\n(0,4), (0,8), (2,3), (3,1), (4,9), (6,8), (7,3) → that's 7 F's. Which matches the \"Flags: 7\/10\" part. So there are 7 F's placed, and 3 mines left to flag.\n\nNow, the goal is to either flag all 10 mines (so we need to find 3 more) or uncover all safe cells. Since the game could end at 100 epochs, but we need to make a move now.\n\nLet's look for cells marked '?' which are unknown. Let's find a '?' that is definitely safe to uncover.\n\nLooking at the current board, let's find rows with '?'. Let's list all '?' positions:\n\nRow 0: columns 9,10,11,12 (assuming the row is \"1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ?\" → columns 9,10,11 are '?'.\n\nRow 1: columns 1, 11, 12 (row1: \"1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" → column1 is '?', columns 11,12 are '?'.\n\nRow 2: columns 10,11,12 (row2: \"2 2 3 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\" → column10 is 1, columns 11,12 are '?'.\n\nRow 10: column 3 (row10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → column3 is '?'.\n\nOther rows don't have '?'.\n\nLet's check row 10, column 3: (10,3) is '?'. Let's look at adjacent cells. The cell (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1, (9,2)=1, (9,3)=1, (9,4)=1, (11,2)=1, (11,3)=1, (11,4)=1. Let's check the number cells around (10,3).\n\nTake (10,2)=1: adjacent cells are (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (10,2) is 1, so 1 mine in these 8 cells. The known cells here: (10,1)=0 (row10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,0)=0, (10,1)=0), (9,1)=0 (row9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (9,0)=0, (9,1)=0), (9,2)=1 (row9: (9,2)=1), (9,3)=1 (row9: (9,3)=1), (11,1)=0 (row11: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (11,0)=0, (11,1)=0), (11,2)=1 (row11: (11,2)=1), (11,3)=1 (row11: (11,3)=1). So the adjacent cells to (10,2) are mostly 0s and 1s. The unknown cell here is (10,3) and (9,3), (11,3), etc. Maybe not helpful.\n\nLet's check row 1, column1: (1,1) is '?'. Let's look at the surrounding numbers. (1,0)=1 (row1: \"1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ?\" → (1,0)=1). (1,0)=1's adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). (0,0)=1 (row0: (0,0)=1), (0,1)=1 (row0: (0,1)=1), (0,2)=1 (row0: (0,2)=1), (2,0)=2 (row2: (2,0)=2), (2,1)=2 (row2: (2,1)=2), (2,2)=3 (row2: (2,2)=3). So (1,0)=1 has adjacent cells: (0,0)=1 (safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (1,1)=? (unknown), (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=2 (safe), (2,2)=3 (safe). So (1,0)=1 indicates that among these 7 cells (since (1,0) is the cell itself), wait no: the number in (1,0) is 1, which means the 8 adjacent cells around (1,0) have 1 mine. The 8 adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (0,-1) invalid, (1,-1) invalid, (2,-1) invalid. So valid adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). So (1,0)=1: among these 5 cells, 1 is a mine.\n\nWe know (0,0)=1 (which is a number, so safe), (0,1)=1 (safe), (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=2 (safe). So the only unknown is (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) must be the mine? Wait, no. Because (1,0) is 1, meaning 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1). All of these except (1,1) are numbers (safe, not mines). So the mine must be (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) is a mine. So we should flag it. But wait, let's confirm.\n\nWait, (0,0) is 1: that's a number, so it's a safe cell (uncovered), not a mine. Same for (0,1)=1, (2,0)=2, (2,1)=2: all are uncovered safe cells. So the only possible mine in the adjacent cells of (1,0) is (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) must be a mine. So we should flag (1,1).\n\nBut wait, let's check another cell that might confirm this. Let's look at (1,2)=2 (row1: (1,2)=2). The adjacent cells to (1,2) are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). (0,1)=1 (safe), (0,2)=1 (safe), (0,3)=1 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,1)=2 (safe), (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=F (flagged mine). So (1,2)=2 has adjacent cells. The known mines here: (2,3)=F (if that's a correct mine). So (2,3) is a mine. Then the other mine for (1,2)=2 would be (1,1). Because 2 mines total. So (2,3) is 1, (1,1) is another. That adds up. So (1,2)=2 has two mines: (2,3) and (1,1). That makes sense. So (1,1) is a mine.\n\nTherefore, we should flag (1,1). But wait, the current flags are 7\/10, so adding this would make 8. But let's confirm again.\n\nAlternatively, let's check (2,2)=3 (row2: (2,2)=3). Adjacent cells: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3). (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,3)=2 (safe), (2,1)=2 (safe), (2,3)=F (mine), (3,1)=F (mine), (3,2)=2 (safe), (3,3)=1 (safe). So (2,2)=3 has (2,3)=F and (3,1)=F as two mines. So there should be one more mine in the adjacent cells. The remaining cell is (1,1). So (1,1) is the third mine. That confirms it: (2,2)=3 has three mines: (2,3), (3,1), and (1,1). Therefore, (1,1) is a mine. So we need to flag (1,1).\n\nAnother '?' is in row 10, column 3: (10,3). Let's check its adjacent cells. The cell (10,2)=1 (row10: (10,2)=1). The adjacent cells of (10,2) are (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2), (11,3). (9,1)=0 (row9: (9,1)=0), (9,2)=1 (row9: (9,2)=1), (9,3)=1 (row9: (9,3)=1), (10,1)=0 (row10: (10,1)=0), (11,1)=0 (row11: (11,1)=0), (11,2)=1 (row11: (11,2)=1), (11,3)=1 (row11: (11,3)=1). So the only unknown is (10,3). (10,2)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells are all safe except possibly (10,3). But (9,3)=1 (which is a number, so safe), (11,3)=1 (safe), (9,2)=1 (safe), (11,2)=1 (safe). So the adjacent cells of (10,2) have no mines except maybe (10,3). But since (10,2)=1, and all other adjacent cells are safe (numbers), then (10,3) must be safe. Because if (10,3) were a mine, then (10,2) would have 1 mine, which matches. Wait, no: if (10,3) is a mine, then (10,2) would have 1 mine (correct). But if (10,3) is safe, then (10,2) would have 0 mines, which contradicts (10,2)=1. Therefore, (10,3) must be a mine. Wait, no: (10,2) is a number 1, which means the 8 surrounding cells have 1 mine. Let's list all 8 cells:\n\n(9,1): 0 (safe)\n(9,2): 1 (safe)\n(9,3): 1 (safe)\n(10,1): 0 (safe)\n(10,3): ? (unknown)\n(11,1): 0 (safe)\n(11,2): 1 (safe)\n(11,3): 1 (safe)\n\nAll these cells except (10,3) are safe (since they are numbers, not mines). So the only possible mine is (10,3). Therefore, (10,3) must be a mine. So we should flag (10,3).\n\nWait, but let's check (10,4)=1 (row10: (10,4)=1). Adjacent cells to (10,4) are (9,3), (9,4), (9,5), (10,3), (10,5), (11,3), (11,4), (11,5). (9,3)=1 (safe), (9,4)=1 (safe), (9,5)=0 (row9: (9,5)=0), (10,5)=0 (row10: (10,5)=0), (11,3)=1 (safe), (11,4)=1 (safe), (11,5)=0 (row11: (11,5)=0). So (10,4)=1 has adjacent cells. The only unknown is (10,3). So (10,4)=1 must have 1 mine in adjacent cells. If (10,3) is a mine, then that's 1 mine, which matches. So that confirms (10,3) is a mine.\n\nSo now we have two possible mines to flag: (1,1) and (10,3). Let's check if there are others.\n\nLooking at row 0, column9: '?'. Let's check (0,8)=F (flagged). (0,8) is in row0, column8. The cell (0,7)=0 (row0: (0,7)=0). A 0 means no mines in adjacent cells. The adjacent cells to (0,7) are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6)=0 (safe), (0,8)=F (flagged as mine), (1,6)=0 (row1: (1,6)=0), (1,7)=0 (row1: (1,7)=0), (1,8)=1 (row1: (1,8)=1). Since (0,7)=0, there are no mines in its adjacent cells. But (0,8) is flagged as a mine, which is adjacent to (0,7). But (0,7)=0 means no mines around, so (0,8) cannot be a mine. Therefore, (0,8) is an incorrect flag. So we should unflag (0,8). That's one of the 3 incorrect flags.\n\nSimilarly, (0,4)=F. Let's check (0,3)=1. (0,3) is adjacent to (0,4). (0,3)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. (0,4) is F. Let's check (1,3)=2 (row1, column3=2). (1,3) is adjacent to (0,3), (0,4), (0,2), (1,2), (1,4), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). (0,3)=1 (safe), (0,4)=F (mine), (0,2)=1 (safe), (1,2)=2 (safe), (1,4)=2 (safe), (2,2)=3 (safe), (2,3)=F (mine), (2,4)=1 (safe). So (1,3)=2 has two mines: (0,4) and (2,3). That adds up. So (0,4) is a correct flag.\n\n(2,3)=F: let's check (2,2)=3. As before, (2,2)=3 has (2,3), (3,1), (1,1) as mines. So (2,3) is correct.\n\n(3,1)=F: (3,0)=1. Adjacent cells to (3,0) are (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1). (2,0)=2 (safe), (2,1)=2 (safe), (3,1)=F (mine), (4,0)=1 (safe), (4,1)=1 (safe). (3,0)=1: 1 mine, which is (3,1). Correct.\n\n(4,9)=F: let's check (4,8)=1 (row4: (4,8)=1). Adjacent cells to (4,8) are (3,7), (3,8), (3,9), (4,7), (4,9), (5,7), (5,8), (5,9). (3,7)=0 (row3: (3,7)=0), (3,8)=1 (row3: (3,8)=1), (3,9)=1 (row3: (3,9)=1), (4,7)=0 (row4: (4,7)=0), (4,9)=F (mine), (5,7)=1 (row5: (5,7)=1), (5,8)=2 (row5: (5,8)=2), (5,9)=2 (row5: (5,9)=2). (4,8)=1: 1 mine in adjacent cells. (4,9)=F is a mine, so that's correct. So (4,9) is a correct flag.\n\n(6,8)=F: (6,7)=1 (row6: (6,7)=1). Adjacent cells to (6,7) are (5,6), (5,7), (5,8), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8). (5,6)=0 (row5: (5,6)=0), (5,7)=1 (safe), (5,8)=2 (safe), (6,6)=0 (row6: (6,6)=0), (6,8)=F (mine), (7,6)=0 (row7: (7,6)=0), (7,7)=1 (safe), (7,8)=1 (safe). (6,7)=1: 1 mine, which is (6,8). Correct.\n\n(7,3)=F: (7,2)=1 (row7: (7,2)=1). Adjacent cells to (7,2) are (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (7,3), (8,1), (8,2), (8,3). (6,1)=0 (row6: (6,1)=0), (6,2)=1 (row6: (6,2)=1), (6,3)=1 (row6: (6,3)=1), (7,1)=0 (row7: (7,1)=0), (7,3)=F (mine), (8,1)=0 (row8: (8,1)=0), (8,2)=1 (row8: (8,2)=1), (8,3)=1 (row8: (8,3)=1). (7,2)=1: 1 mine, which is (7,3). Correct.\n\nSo the 7 flags are: (0,4), (2,3), (3,1), (4,9), (6,8), (7,3), (0,8). Wait, earlier count was 7, but (0,8) is adjacent to (0,7)=0, which is a 0, meaning no mines around. (0,7) is in row0, column7=0. Its adjacent cells are (0,6)=0, (0,8)=F, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1. Since (0,7)=0, there can't be any mines in those adjacent cells. So (0,8) is a mine, but (0,7)=0 says no mines around, which is a contradiction. Therefore, (0,8) is an incorrect flag. So among the 7 flags, 6 are correct (since (0,8) is wrong), and 1 incorrect. But the score is 0.7, which is 7\/10, so 7 correct flags. That suggests that (0,8) is actually a correct mine, but (0,7)=0 is a problem.\n\nWait, (0,7)=0: that means the 8 adjacent cells to (0,7) have 0 mines. The adjacent cells are (0,6), (0,8), (1,6), (1,7), (1,8). (0,6)=0 (safe), (0,8)=F (mine), (1,6)=0 (safe), (1,7)=0 (safe), (1,8)=1 (safe). If (0,8) is a mine, then (0,7) would have 1 mine in adjacent cells, but (0,7) is 0. Therefore, (0,8) cannot be a mine. So (0,8) is an incorrect flag. Therefore, the correct flags are 6, but the score is 0.7 (7 correct). So maybe my analysis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the board is 9x9, and the rows beyond 8 are not part of the game. Let's assume the board is 9x9, rows 0-8, columns 0-8. Let's re-express the current board accordingly, truncating each row to 9 cells:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 → (0,0)=1, (0,1)=1, (0,2)=1, (0,3)=1, (0,4)=F, (0,5)=1, (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0, (0,8)=1\nRow 1: 1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 → (1,0)=1, (1,1)=?, (1,2)=2, (1,3)=2, (1,4)=2, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0, (1,8)=1\nRow 2: 2 2 3 F 1 0 0 0 0 → (2,0)=2, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=F, (2,4)=1, (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0\nRow 3: 1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 → (3,0)=1, (3,1)=F, (3,2)=2, (3,3)=1, (3,4)=1, (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0, (3,8)=1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 → (4,0)=1, (4,1)=1, (4,2)=1, (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0, (4,8)=1\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 → (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0, (5,7)=1, (5,8)=2\nRow 6: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F → (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,2)=1, (6,3)=1, (6,4)=1, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0, (6,7)=1, (6,8)=F\nRow 7: 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 → (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,2)=1, (7,3)=F, (7,4)=1, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0, (7,7)=1, (7,8)=1\nRow 8: 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 → (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,2)=1, (8,3)=1, (8,4)=1, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0\n\nThis makes more sense as a 9x9 grid. The initial problem statement says 9x9, so the rest of the cells in the original input were probably part of a formatting error. Now, let's re-analyze with this 9x9 grid.\n\nFlags in this 9x9 grid are:\n\n(0,4)=F\n\n(2,3)=F\n\n(3,1)=F\n\n(6,8)=F\n\n(7,3)=F\n\nThat's 5 F's. Wait, the original problem says \"Flags:7\/10\", so maybe I missed some. Let's check the original current board again. The user wrote:\n\nCurrent Board:\n1 1 1 1 F 1 0 0 1 F ? ? ? → row0 has two F's: (0,4) and (0,8)\n1 ? 2 2 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 ? ? → row1 has no F's\n2 2 3 F 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? → row2 has one F: (2,3)\n1 F 2 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 2 1 1 → row3 has one F: (3,1)\n1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 → row4 has one F: (4,9)\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 0 0 → row5 no F's\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 F 1 0 0 0 → row6 has one F: (6,8)\n0 0 1 F 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 → row7 has one F: (7,3)\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row8 no F's\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row9 no F's\n0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row10 no F's\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row11 no F's\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 → row12 no F's\n\nSo in this case, the F's are at:\n\n(0,4), (0,8), (2,3), (3,1), (4,9), (6,8), (7,3) → 7 F's, which matches \"Flags:7\/10\". Now, considering the board might be larger than 9x9 (maybe 13x13), but the problem says 9x9. Perhaps it's a mistake, but we have to proceed.\n\nLet's focus on the '?' cells. The '?' are in:\n\nRow0: (0,9), (0,10), (0,11)\n\nRow1: (1,1), (1,11), (1,12)\n\nRow2: (2,11), (2,12)\n\nRow10: (10,3)\n\nAssuming the board is larger, but let's pick a '?' that is safe to uncover. For example, (10,3) in row10, column3. Let's check the cells around it. Row10: \"0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (10,2)=1, (10,4)=1. The cell (10,2)=1 has adjacent cells. If (10,3) is uncovered and is a number, it might help. Alternatively, let's look for a cell that is definitely safe.\n\nAnother approach: since the game ends if we uncover a mine, we need to avoid mines. Let's find a '?' that is adjacent to a 0, which means it's safe. For example, cells adjacent to 0s are safe. Let's look for 0s.\n\nRow0: (0,6)=0, (0,7)=0. Adjacent cells to (0,6)=0 are (0,5), (0,7), (1,5), (1,6), (1,7). (0,5)=1 (safe), (0,7)=0 (safe), (1,5)=1 (safe), (1,6)=0 (safe), (1,7)=0 (safe). So no '?' here.\n\nRow1: (1,6)=0, (1,7)=0. Adjacent cells are (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (1,5), (1,8), (2,5), (2,6), (2,7). All safe, no '?'.\n\nRow2: (2,5)=0, (2,6)=0, (2,7)=0, (2,8)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow3: (3,5)=0, (3,6)=0, (3,7)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow4: (4,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (4,5)=0, (4,6)=0, (4,7)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow5: (5,0)=0, (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0, (5,4)=0, (5,5)=0, (5,6)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow6: (6,0)=0, (6,1)=0, (6,5)=0, (6,6)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow7: (7,0)=0, (7,1)=0, (7,5)=0, (7,6)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow8: (8,0)=0, (8,1)=0, (8,5)=0, (8,6)=0, (8,7)=0, (8,8)=0. Adjacent cells are safe.\n\nRow9: (9,0)=0, (9,1)=0, (9,5)=0, (9,6)=0, (9,7)=0, (9,8)=0, (9,9)=0, (9,10)=0, (9,11)=0, (9,12)=0. All adjacent cells safe.\n\nRow10: (10,0)=0, (10,1)=0, (10,5)=0, (10,6)=0, (10,7)=0, (10,8)=0, (10,9)=0, (10,10)=0, (10,11)=0, (10,12)=0. The '?' is at (10,3).\n\nRow11: (11,0)=0, (11,1)=0, (11,5)=0, (11,6)=0, (11,7)=0, (11,8)=0, (11,9)=0, (11,10)=0, (11,11)=0, (11,12)=0.\n\nRow12: all 0s.\n\nThe '?' at (10,3) is in row10, column3. The cells around (10,3) are:\n\n(9,2)=1 (row9: \"0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" → (9,2)=1)\n\n(9,3)=1 (row9: (9,3)=1)\n\n(9,4)=1 (row9: (9,4)=1)\n\n(10,2)=1 (row10: (10,2)=1)\n\n(10,4)=1 (row10: (10,4)=1)\n\n(11,2)=1 (row11: (11,2)=1)\n\n(11,3)=1 (row11: (11,3)=1)\n\n(11,4)=1 (row11: (11,4)=1)\n\nAll these are 1s. The cell (10,3) is surrounded by 1s. If we uncover (10,3), it's likely a 1, which is safe. Since all adjacent cells are 1s, uncovering (10,3) is safe. Therefore, the best move is to uncover (10,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (10,3)","uncover (10,3)"],"unflags":0,"seed":15,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
