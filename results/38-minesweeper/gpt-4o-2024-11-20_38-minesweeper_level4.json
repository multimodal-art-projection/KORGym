Since the board is entirely unknown, there is no particular information to guide the initial choice. Let's uncover the center of the board to maximize the chance of uncovering safe cells.\n\n**Answer:** uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Based on the current board state, we will analyze and pick a cell to uncover systematically. Our goal is to safely uncover based on the rules and hints given. For this initial decision, we'll look at the surrounding numbers and identify any safe moves.\n\n### Explanation:\n- The cell (0,0) is marked as 1. This means there is one mine adjacent to it.\n- The cell (0,1) is marked as 2, which suggests there are two mines adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, cells near zeroes (such as (1,2), (1,3), etc.) appear to be free from mines. Given this information, a safe spot to uncover is a zero-adjacent region.\n\n### Action:\nWe choose to uncover a safe location. Let's pick cell (2,2), as it is surrounded by zero-marked cells.\n\n**Answer:** uncover (2,2)","To figure out the best action, let's analyze the given board carefully. The board reveals certain numbers, and these numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to those cells. Using this information, we can deduce where mines are more likely to be.\n\nGiven that the top-left part of the grid is revealed, we can focus on this section for now to make logical deductions.\n\n### Observations:\n1. The bottom row of the partially revealed area (row 4) shows \"3\" in position (4, 1). This means that exactly 3 mines are present among the 8 cells adjacent to (4, 1).\n2. The adjacent cells of \"3\" include:\n   - (4, 0), (4, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2)\n   - (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2)\n3. Cells like (4, 0), (4, 2), and others around this \"3\" might contain mines.\n\nTo proceed carefully, let's uncover an adjacent cell that does **not** guarantee a mine based on the current observations.    Cells","Given the current board state and the rules of Minesweeper, we'll analyze the information available and make a logical move to safely progress in the game.\n\n### Analysis:\nFrom the visible part of the board:\n1. The numbers represent the number of adjacent mines.\n2. The `1`s and `2`s adjacent to cells already appear to be surrounded by `?` blocks, indicating there could be mines.\n3. The `0`s indicate there are no mines in the adjacent cells. Therefore, any adjacent `?` blocks to a `0` are guaranteed to be safe to uncover.\n\n### Safe Move:\nLooking at the board, in Row 2:\n- The cell (2,0) contains `0`, which means all its adjacent `?` cells (like (1,0), (3,0), (1,1), (2,1), and so on) are safe.  \n\n### Next Action:\nWe will uncover a safe cell adjacent to (2,0), such as (2,1).\n\n### Response:\n**Answer: uncover (2,1)**","Based on the game board provided, our strategy will be to uncover cells with minimal risk, analyze the numerical clues, and logically deduce where mines may exist. I'll start by analyzing the grid and trying an action that seems safe based on the surrounding clues. \n\nObserving the labeled numbers, the safest move seems to be cells adjacent to already uncovered \"0\" cells, as these cannot contain mines.\n\n### Key observations:\n1. In row 2 (`0 0 0 0 0 1`), all 0's indicate the adjacent cells are safe to uncover.\n2. The \"1\" in row 2 (column 5) implies only one mine is adjacent, and this can help deduce future moves.\n\n### Decision:\nUncover a cell adjacent to the zeros. For instance, the cell at `(2, 5)` is adjacent to several revealed cells with zeros, making it safe.\n\n**Answer**: uncover (2,5)","Answer: uncover (4,0)","uncover (4,0)"],"unflags":0,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Its neighbors are [(0, 4), (0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6)] (considering valid positions). We can see that most of these neighbors are known safe cells, leaving (0, 4) as a possible mine.\n3. Similarly, looking at other numbers provides hints for uncovering or flagging mines.\n\n### Safe Move:\nFrom the board, let's choose the safest move based on visible patterns. The bottom rows look safer to uncover.\n\n### Action:\n**Answer: uncover (5,0)**","To make an informed action, we analyze the provided Minesweeper board. By examining the revealed numbers around the unknown blocks (`?`) and evaluating flagged mines, we aim to deduce the next logical step. \n\nUpon inspection:\n\n1. Safe cells can be uncovered if the interpreted numbers indicate the absence of hidden mines nearby.\n2. Cells likely containing mines can be flagged if surrounding numbers confirm their positions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n- From the current board, examine the uncovered parts for numbers and their adjacent cells.\n- Identify any `?` block around a revealed number matching the count of discovered flags (mines) nearby.\n  \nLooking at the board, I can see around coordinate `(6,3)` (a `?` block):\n\n- The revealed numbers nearby indicate `(6,3)` could safely contain a mine since nearby `(7,3)` occupies similar contexts = .\n\n\n\n","To make an informed decision, we need to identify cells that are either guaranteed to be mines or guaranteed to be safe based on the current board state. Looking at the data provided, there's an opportunity to uncover safe cells or flag potential mines.\n\nLet’s analyze the board to find an action.

The only unknown adjacent cell is (0,6).\n2. The `2` at (3,2) suggests two mines are in the adjacent cells. However, more information is needed to conclude specific mine locations at this point.\n3. Many areas of the board remain unexplored or lack sufficient clues for us to make safe decisions about uncovering or flagging cells.\n\nBased on this safe deduction from the board, our next action should involve cautiously exploring or uncovering logical cells to reveal more information.\n\n---\n\n### My decision:\nA safe move would be .neand<br>","To decide the next move, I'll analyze the current board and evaluate the surrounding cells.

A number represents the number of mines adjacent to that cell.\n2. I'll deduce safe moves based on cells that are fully \"solvable\" with the information available.\n\n### Observation\nLooking at cell (3,6) with value `1`:\n1.

There’s unexplored ‘?’.\n\nWe can safly","Based on the current state of the board, let's analyze potential moves step by step. Ideally, we aim to uncover cells with no risk, or flag cells we strongly suspect contain mines.\n\n### Observations:\n- There are numbers on the board indicating how many mines exist adjacent to the respective cells.\n- Looking at cell `(5,8)` with the number `2`, there are two mines adjacent to it. We need to carefully evaluate nearby `?` to flag potential mines.\n- Similarly, cells around `7,3`, `8,3`, `9,3`, and `10,3` with adjacent `?` need consideration.\n\n### Safe Move:\nWe need a relatively safe move to uncover a cell.\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,2)","Based on the current board state, let's analyze the situation:\n\nThere's a clear pattern where cells adjacent to numbers that represent the count of nearby mines can give clues about whether any hidden cells ('?') have a mine or not. Specifically, safe cells are often directly exposed if surrounding flags or non-'?' cells satisfy mine-counts.\n\n### Observations:\n1. In row 4, column 8 (`board[4][8]`), there's a `1`, and there is only one '?' in its surroundings: position `(4,9)`. This suggests `(4,9)` contains a mine.\n2.

Uncovering safe areas and flagging mines strategically will progress toward the win condition.\n\nFrom the board, I can see safe areas such as blocks adjacent to zeroes or areas surrounded by known patterns.

Only two possible locations remain as adjacent unrevealed cells: (0,6) and (1,6). We now suspect there are mines there.\n\n2. **(3,2)** is a `1`, and it has only one adjacent unrevealed cell, **(4,2)**. Based on logic, this unrevealed cell **(4,2)** is safe to uncover.\n\n### Safe Move:\nWe can confidently uncover **(4,2)** since no mine exists there.\n\n**Answer:** uncover (4,2)","The key to playing Minesweeper effectively is observing the numbers on the board to deduce the locations of mines.

Here's the current partial board:\n\n```\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1 1 1 1 ? ? ?\n? ? ? 1 0 0 1 ? ? ?\n1 2 ? 1 0 1 2 ? ? ?\n0 1 1 1 0 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 1 1 ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The clues near revealed blocks:\n   - The `1` in (1,3) suggests exactly one mine is adjacent, but that doesn't immediately help us decide.\n   - The `2` in (3,1) suggests two mines are adjacent to it. On inspection of possible adjacent cells, we cannot safely determine any specific cell to be a mine yet.\n   \n2. The `0`s on the board (cells like (2,4)) indicate all neighboring cells are safe. We should prioritize uncovering these.\n\nThe first safe action we can identify is adjacent to the `0`s. The cell `(2,3)` has already indicated all surrounding cells are safe. Therefore, we should uncover `(2,2)` or a nearby '?' safely surrounded  \n\n**Answer** : is_DIALOG_BOX etc","Based on the current board, the safest action would be to uncover a block where adjacent numbers suggest no risk of uncovering a mine. Since the block (3,4) has already been uncovered as \"0\" (meaning no adjacent mines), its neighbors are safe to uncover. Therefore, it is safe to uncover (2,4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,4)","Looking at the current board, the safe cells are those that are directly adjacent to already revealed \"0\" cells. These cells cannot possibly contain mines. Therefore, we can uncover them.\n\nFrom the given board, the \"0\" cells are located at positions:\n- (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,3), (5,2), (5,1), (5,0), (4,0), (3,0).\n\nThis means that the cells adjacent to these \"0\" cells are most likely candidates for uncovering. Let’s start by choosing the next logical position based on adjacency to these known \"0\" cells.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the known zeros:\n- The first cell to uncover safely is (3,4) since it's adjacent to a \"0\".\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","Analyzing the current state of the board and focusing on logical deductions, the best move is to uncover a safe cell based on the numbers provided. Given the grid, the most logical safe move appears to be uncovering a cell adjacent to zero values. \n\nLet's proceed with the action.\n\n**Answer:** uncover (5,0)","Based on the given board, we need to make logical moves to uncover safe cells or flag potential mines. Let's analyze uncovered cells to decide on the next move. \n\nIn the board:\n\n- At (3,3), the cell is `1`, meaning there is 1 mine adjacent.\n- Since (3,4) already displays `0`, it has no adjacent mines. This indicates it is safe to uncover further surrounding cells.\n  \nThe safest move is to uncover block (3,4). \n\n**Answer:** uncover (3,4)","To decide on the best action to take, I will analyze the current board for consistent patterns and safe opportunities to uncover or flag cells. Looking at the provided board:\n\n### Observations:\n1. There is a `0` in row 2, column 4 `(2,4)`. Cells adjacent to `0` are always safe because no mines are nearby. Thus, all surrounding cells of `(2,4)` can be safely uncovered, specifically `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(2,3)`, and so on. \n   \nWe prioritize uncover expanding adjac helpu:\n\n","To make a move, we should analyze the board and make a reasonable choice. From the current board layout, we can make the following observations:\n\n1. The cell (4,3) has a value of 1, which means there is one mine adjacent to it. The cells adjacent to (4,3) are (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (4,2), (4,4), (5,2), (5,3), and (5,4). From the visible board, the only unknown cell among these that could be a mine is at (4,5). \n\n2. Similarly, the cell (3,3) with a value of 1 indicates that one of its adjacent cells contains a mine.Visible grid on end","Looking at the current board, we need to make decisions based on the revealed numbers that indicate the number of adjacent mines. Let's analyze cell (3,4). It is currently \"0\", which means there are **no mines at all in its adjacent cells**. This allows us to uncover more surrounding cells without risk.\n\n### Safe Neighboring Option:\nSince we know cell (3,4) has zero adjacent mines, **the adjacent cells (2,4), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4), etc., are safe to uncover**. However, we'll start systematically.\n\n### Action:\nLet’s uncover cell (2,4), as it's adjacent to the \"0\" block and guaranteed safe.\n\n**Answer: uncover (2,4)**","Analyzing the current board state, the cell (3,4) is already uncovered with a \"0\", indicating there are no mines in its surrounding cells. This implies all 8 surrounding cells are safe. Based on this logic, the next best move would be to uncover one of the adjacent unknown cells around (3,4).\n\nThe adjacent unknown cells for (3,4) are (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5). Based on previously revealed hints on the board, we can infer the safest cell to uncover first.\n\nLet's proceed with uncovering cell (4,3), as it's next to a \"1\" and likely safe.\n\n**Answer:** uncover (4,3)","To determine the next move, let's analyze the board carefully. We aim to uncover safe cells until we are certain enough to flag mines based on the numbers surrounding them.\n\n### Observations\n1. The board has cells revealing numbers like `1`, `2`, etc., indicating the number of adjacent mines. We need to uncover safe cells using logic derived from these numbers and their surroundings.\n\n2. The starting point could involve cells already surrounded by `0`, as they cannot have mines adjacent to them.\n\nHere’s the current action:\n\n### Action\nAnswer: uncover (5,3)","To make a sensible move in Minesweeper, we analyze the numbers and adjacent cells. From the board given, let's reason step-by-step:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. The number `1` in (3,3) has one unidentified neighbor, (3,4).\n2. The number `1` in (3,3) indicates exactly one mine in its eight adjacent cells.\n3. Every other adjacent cell around (3,3) except (3,4) is either known to be safe (`0`s) or has been uncovered.\n\nTherefore, **(3,4)** is safe to uncover because the mine already accounted for isn't in this position.\n\n### Action:\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","To make the best move in Minesweeper, we should analyze the numbers that provide clues about adjacent mines and make moves accordingly.

This suggests there are two adjacent mines.\n  - From its surrounding cells `(2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2),...?`\n  \nSimilarly diving around","To choose the next move, we should analyze the information given on the board. Let's identify the safest cell to uncover by analyzing the numbers on the board and the surrounding blocks.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n1. The cell at (3, 3) is labeled \"1\", which means there is only one mine in its adjacent cells. Currently, the adjacent cells are as follows: (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3), and (4, 4).\n\n- Out of those, (3, 4) is the only unrevealed block adjacent to (3, 3) that doesn't seem at high risk because adjacent revealed cells like (2, 3) already emphasize moderate clues).\n\nLet’s uncover (3, 4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)","To play Minesweeper correctly and logically, we should analyze the board carefully and make decisions based on revealed numbers. With the provided board, let's proceed step by step:\n\n### Analysis of the Board:\n\n1. In the third row (index 2), the grid `(2,4)` has been uncovered and contains a `0`. This indicates that all its surrounding cells are safe (have `0` mines).\n2. The safe cells adjacent to `(2,4)` are `(1,3)`, `(1,4)`, `(1,5)`, `(2,3)`, `(2,5)`, and `(3,3)`. Some of these have already been uncovered, while others are still unknown (`?`).\n\n---\n\n### Next Step:\n\nSince all cells adjacent to `(2,4)` are safe, the logical move is to uncover one of the unknown cells near it. Let's uncover `(2,3)`, which lies directly to the left of `(2,4)`.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** uncover (2,3)","Based on the current board, I'll select a safe move to progress with the game. Observing the board, I notice that the cell at **(3, 4)** is adjacent to cells indicating \"0,\" which confirms it is safe to uncover. Here's the answer:\n\n**Answer: uncover (3,4)**","Based on the current board and the rules of Minesweeper, the cell `(3,4)` was previously uncovered. It has a numeric clue `0`, which means there are no mines around it. From this information, the adjacent cells `(2,3)`, `(2,4)`, `(2,5)`, `(3,3)`, `(3,5)`, `(4,3)`, `(4,4)`, and `(4,5)` must all be safe, as they are adjacent to a cell with a `0`.\n\nThe safest step is to continue uncovering these adjacent cells around `(3,4)`.\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,3)","In the current board, I am analyzing safe moves based on adjacent numbers and the number of \"0\"s.
