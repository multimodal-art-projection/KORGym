For example, consider cell (8,3) which shows “1”. Its surrounding cells include the flagged mine at (8,2) (remember “F” means we believe there’s a mine there) plus several unknown cells. Since (8,3) indicates exactly one mine around it and we already have one flag, every other neighbor must be safe. One of these unturned safe neighbors is (9,2) – so we can safely uncover it.\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,2)","uncover (9,2)","We can use a basic Minesweeper deduction here. Look at the revealed cell at (1,2) – it shows a 1. Its eight neighbors are:\n • (0,1) = 0    (0,2) = 0   (0,3) = 1  \n • (1,1) = 0    (1,3) = 2  \n • (2,1) = 0    (2,2) = 1   (2,3) = ?\nOnly one of these eight cells is still unknown: (2,3). Since (1,2)’s value is 1 and none of its neighbors have yet been flagged, that one unknown must be a mine. \n\nTherefore the correct action is to flag cell (2,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (2,3)","flag (2,3)","After a careful look at the board we can use reasoning on cell (4,3). Its value is 1 and its eight neighbors are:\n\n • Row3: (3,2)=2, (3,3)=2, (3,4)=1  \n • Row4: (4,2)=?   , (4,4)=0  \n • Row5: (5,2)=1, (5,3)=1, (5,4)=0  \n\nNotice that every neighbor except (4,2) is already uncovered (and none is flagged yet). Since the clue “1” means there is exactly one mine adjacent to (4,3) and (4,2) is the only covered cell around it, (4,2) must be a mine. \n\nThus the safe action is to flag (4,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (4,2)","flag (4,2)","Answer: flag (8,1)","flag (8,1)","We can deduce one safe move by looking at the top‐left portion of the board. For example, consider cell (7,0) which shows a “1”. Its adjacent cells are:\n • (6,0) with a 0\n • (6,1) with a 0\n • (7,1) with a 2\n • (8,0) which is “?”\n • (8,1) which is flagged (“F”)\n\nSince cell (7,0) shows 1, it requires exactly one mine among its adjacent cells. There is already one flagged cell at (8,1). That means none of the other adjacent cells—particularly the unknown cell (8,0)—can be a mine. Therefore, (8,0) is safe to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,0)","uncover (8,0)","Based on the board’s numbers, we can deduce a safe flag move. Look at the cell at (7,6) which shows a “1”. Its eight neighbors come from rows 6–8 and columns 5–7. Here are those neighbors:\n\n• Row 6: (6,5) is uncovered (0), (6,6) is uncovered (1), and (6,7) is still unknown.\n• Row 7: (7,5) is uncovered (0) and (7,7) is uncovered (1).\n• Row 8: (8,5) is uncovered (1), (8,6) is uncovered (1), and (8,7) is uncovered (0).\n\nSince (7,6) shows 1 and its only unknown neighbor is (6,7), it must be that the one mine counted is at (6,7).

(For example, cells (0,0) to (3,3) are uncovered and show only 0’s, 1’s, or 2’s.) The “frontier” between known and unknown cells lies along the fourth row and fourth column (using 0–indexing).\n\nOne useful region is around cell (3,0). It shows a “1” and its known neighbors are (2,0) and (2,1) (both 0), with the only unrevealed neighbors being (4,0) and (4,1). Since (3,0) must have exactly one mine adjacent, we know that exactly one of (4,0) and (4,1) is a mine – though we cannot yet tell which one is safe. (Likewise, many of the last‐move deductions on the frontier lead to “if–then” conditions but do not yet give any cell that is guaranteed safe.)\n\nIn such situations (and with our board not “forcing” any flag because of overlapping constraints), a common technique is to “probe” one of the border cells that is adjacent to a low‐number cell and so is likely to trigger a chain of clearings if it isn’t a mine. In this case, many solvers would opt for an edge like (4,0) because it only touches two revealed numbers ((3,0)=1 and (3,1)=1) whose frontiers are small.\n\nTherefore a very reasonable – although not “forced‐by‐logic” – move is to uncover (4,0). (If it’s safe, its number and any resulting cascade will help us refine further deductions.)\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,0)","uncover (4,0)","Based on the numbers already uncovered, we can make a deduction. Look at cell (3,0) – its value is 1. Its revealed neighbors are:\n\n• (2,0) = 0  \n• (2,1) = 0  \n• (3,1) = 1  \n• (4,0) = 1\n\nAll of these are safe, leaving only one adjacent cell still covered, which is (4,1). Since (3,0) shows “1” and the only unknown neighbor is (4,1), that cell must contain a mine.\n\nAnswer: flag (4,1)","flag (4,1)","Answer: uncover (4,2)","uncover (4,2)","Based on the board, we can use some simple deductions. For example, look at cell (4,0) which shows “1.” Its neighbors are:\n • (3,0): already revealed as 1\n • (3,1): already revealed as 1\n • (4,1): flagged as F\n • (5,0) and (5,1): both still “?”\n\nSince (4,0) is “1” and already has one flagged neighbor (at (4,1)), the remaining adjacent cells (5,0) and (5,1) must be safe. To expand our cleared area, we can choose either one. I will uncover (5,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,0)","uncover (5,0)","Answer: flag (4,3)","flag (4,3)","Based on the current board, one deduction we can make is using the one at (8,9). This cell shows a “1” and its eight-neighbor region (considering the grid’s valid bounds) has exactly one unknown neighbor. Looking at the neighbors of (8,9):\n\n• Row 7 (one row above row 8): cells (7,8), (7,9), (7,10) are all numbers (and are 0 in most cases) and already uncovered.\n• Row 8 (same row): cell (8,8) is uncovered and safe; cell (8,10) is uncovered.\n• Row 9 (one row below row 8): cells (9,8) and (9,9) are numbers (0 and 1 respectively) and uncovered; however, (9,10) is still “?”.\n\nBecause (8,9) shows “1” and none of its neighboring mines have yet been flagged, the only remaining unknown neighbor (9,10) must be a mine. Therefore, we should flag (9,10).\n\nAnswer: flag (9,10)","flag (9,10)","Answer: uncover (4,4)","uncover (4,4)","Based on the numbers already revealed near the unknown cells on the board, we can deduce a safe move. Consider the two adjacent clues on rows 7–9 at columns 11–12.\n\nFor example, look at the cell at (7,11) which shows a 1. Its neighbors (in rows 7–8) include two unknown cells at (7,12) and (8,12) (all other neighbors around (7,11) are already revealed and known to be safe). This means exactly one mine exists among these two unknown cells.\n\nNow, examine the neighbor at (8,11) that shows a 2. Looking at its neighbors in rows 7–9 and columns 10–12 we have:\n • From row 7: (7,10) is 0, (7,11) shows 1, and (7,12) is unknown.\n • From row 8: (8,10) is 1, (8,11) is 2, and (8,12) is unknown.\n • From row 9: (9,10) is flagged (F) and so assumed to be a mine, and the cells at (9,11) and (9,12) are unknown.\nThe clue in (8,11) tells us that exactly 2 mines must be among its 8 neighbors. One mine is already flagged at (9,10) and we already know from (7,11) that exactly 1 mine must be in the pair {(7,12), (8,12)}. That accounts for the 2 mines that (8,11) hints at. Therefore, the remaining two unknown cells adjacent to (8,11) at (9,11) and (9,12) cannot be mines and must be safe.\n\nA safe move is to uncover one of these cells. For example, we can uncover (9,11).\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,11)","uncover (9,11)","Based on the deduction from cell (4,11) on row 4, which shows a “1”: its eight neighbors are mostly uncovered and only one remains unknown. In detail, the neighbors of (4,11) are:\n • Row 3: cells (3,10) = 1, (3,11) = 1, and (3,12) = ? \n • Row 4: cells (4,10) = 0, (4,12) = 1\n • Row 5: cells (5,10) = 0, (5,11) = 0, (5,12) = 0\n\nSince (4,11)’s value “1” tells us exactly one mine is adjacent and no flags are present among them, the only candidate (the unknown at (3,12)) must be a mine. Thus, the safe move is to flag that cell.\n\nAnswer: flag (3,12)","flag (3,12)","We can take a deductive step using the lower‐right region of the board. Look at the cell at (10,11) which is numbered “1”. Its eight neighbors are:\n\n • Row 9: (9,10)=1, (9,11)=2, (9,12)=1  \n • Row 10: (10,10)=F (flagged), (10,12)=0  \n • Row 11: (11,10)=?, (11,11)=3, (11,12)=1, (11,13)=1  \n\nSince (10,11) shows “1” and one of its neighbors [(10,10)] is flagged, that “1” is already accounted for. Therefore, none of the other adjacent, still-unknown cells can hide a mine.

Thus, the safe move is to flag (7,5).\n\nAnswer: flag (7,5)","flag (7,5)","Answer: uncover (7,6)","uncover (7,6)","Looking at the board, we can reason as follows. Consider the revealed cell at (7,6), which shows a 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n • (6,5): 1 (already revealed)\n • (6,6): 1 (revealed)\n • (6,7): ? (unknown)\n • (7,5): F (flagged)\n • (7,7): ? (unknown)\n • (8,5): 1 (revealed)\n • (8,6): 2 (revealed)\n • (8,7): ? (unknown)\n\nSince (7,6) has a value of 1 and already one adjacent mine has been flagged at (7,5), the remaining unknown adjacent cells around (7,6) must be safe. Therefore, any one of the unknown neighbors—for example, (6,7)—can be safely uncovered.\n\nAnswer: uncover (6,7)","uncover (6,7)","Based on the board clues, one safe move can be deduced. For example, consider the cell at (7,6) which shows a 1. Its eight neighbors include one flagged cell at (7,5) (marked “F”) and the rest are uncovered except (7,7) and (8,7). Because the 1 in (7,6) exactly accounts for the flagged neighbor, any other unknown neighbor must be safe. (7,7) is one such cell.\n\nTherefore, a safe next move is to uncover (7,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,7)","uncover (7,7)","Answer: uncover (4,0)","uncover (4,0)","Let's take a closer look at part of the board to illustrate the reasoning:\n\nConsider the cell at (7,6) on the board. Its displayed value is 1, meaning exactly one mine is among its adjacent cells. The neighbors of (7,6) are:\n\n • Row 6: (6,5), (6,6), (6,7) – all of these are already uncovered numbers.\n • Row 7: (7,5) and (7,7). We see that (7,5) is already flagged (F), and (7,7) is uncovered.\n • Row 8: (8,5), (8,6), and (8,7). Here, (8,5) and (8,6) are revealed numbers, while (8,7) is still unknown.\n\nSince (7,6) shows a 1 and we already have one flagged cell at (7,5), all the other adjacent unknown cells must be safe. In this case, the only remaining unknown neighbor is (8,7).\n\nThus, we can safely uncover cell (8,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,7)","uncover (8,7)","Based on the board's current information, consider the uncovered “2” at position (8,6).

One mine is already flagged at (7,5). The only still-unknown neighbor is (9,7). Since 2 – 1 = 1 and there is exactly one unknown cell, it must contain a mine.\n\nAnswer: flag (9,7)","flag (9,7)","Based on the current board state we can use a basic Minesweeper inference. Consider the uncovered cell at (8,0) with value 1. Its neighbors are:\n\n • Row 7: (7,0)=0 and (7,1)=0  \n • Row 8: (8,1)=1 (already uncovered)  \n • Row 9: (9,0)=? and (9,1)=1 (uncovered)\n\nThere is exactly one unknown neighbor, (9,0), and no flags around (8,0). Since the number in (8,0) is 1, and (0 flagged + 1 unknown = 1), we can deduce that (9,0) must be a mine. Therefore, the correct move is to flag (9,0).\n\nAnswer: flag (9,0)","flag (9,0)","We can reason as follows. Look at cell (10,1), which has been uncovered and shows a 1. Its neighboring cells are:\n • Row 9: (9,0) [F], (9,1) [1], (9,2) [0]\n • Row 10: (10,0) [?], (10,2) [1]\n • Row 11: (11,0) [?], (11,1) [?], (11,2) [?]\nSince (10,1) is a 1 and one of its adjacent cells (9,0) is already flagged, it means that (10,1) has exactly the number of mines marked. Therefore every other adjacent unknown cell must be safe.\nIn particular, cell (10,0) is safe to uncover.\n  \nAnswer: uncover (10,0)","uncover (10,0)","Answer: uncover (2,7)","uncover (2,7)","After reviewing the revealed numbers and their adjacent unknowns, a likely “low‐risk” area appears in the middle–lower right block. For example, consider the cell at (9,8).\n\nHere’s a short summary of one deduction:\n• The uncovered cell at (9,6) shows a 1. Its eight neighbors include (9,7) which has been flagged and several other cells that are now known safe. That mine “account” tells us that in nearby clusters (for instance, around (8,7) and (10,7)) the remaining unknowns share one mine among three cells (for example, cells (9,8), (10,8) and (11,8) when looked at from the perspective of one adjacent clue). \n• In other areas (such as near the 1 at (0,6)) the unknown cells occur in pairs with a 50% mine–density. \n• In contrast, the (9,8) cell is part of a cluster where careful local counting (from, say, the 2 at (8,7) and the 1 at (10,7)) suggests that only one mine is hidden among three unknown cells—in other words, roughly a 33% chance instead of 50%.\n\nAlthough not a “forced–safe” move, (9,8) has a lower risk–reward ratio compared to many other choices.\n\nThus, I choose to uncover cell (9,8).\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,8)","uncover (9,8)","After examining the board, many of the unknown (“?”) cells lie in areas with dependent equations, so there isn’t an obvious cell that is 100% safe by deduction. However, one of the “border” cells – for example, the cell at (0,7) – is involved in a two‐cell equation with (1,7) (since (0,6) shows 1 and its only two unknown neighbors are (0,7) and (1,7), and (1,6)’s clue similarly “shares” these cells, meaning exactly one of them is a mine). Although that means each has a 50% chance, uncovering one of them is a reasonable next move to try and reveal more area.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,7)","uncover (0,7)"],"unflags":0,"seed":8,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

Thus, uncovering (5,2) is a safe move.","uncover (5,2)","Based on the neighboring clues around cell (5,3), we can make a safe deduction. Here’s the reasoning:\n\n• In row5, the cell at (5,3) shows a “2”. Its eight neighbors are:\n – Row4: (4,2) which is flagged (F), (4,3)=1, and (4,4)=0.\n – Row5: (5,2)=3 and (5,4)=1.\n – Row6: (6,2) is unknown, (6,3) is flagged (F), and (6,4)=1.\n• Among these, two cells are already flagged ((4,2) and (6,3)). Since the clue “2” means there are exactly 2 mines in its adjacent cells, no other neighbor can be a mine.\n• Thus, the only remaining unknown neighbor, cell (6,2), is guaranteed to be safe.\n\nAction based on this deduction:\n\nAnswer: uncover (6,2)","uncover (6,2)","Based on the information we currently have, here’s one local deduction that forces a mine:\n\n• Inspect the upper‐left border of the “known” region. On row 4 we see the number 2 at (4,1). Its uncovered neighbors are (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0) and one flagged cell at (4,2). Its hidden (unknown) neighbors in the next row are (5,0) and (5,1). Because the 2 at (4,1) already “sees” one confirmed mine (at (4,2)), it means exactly one of (5,0) and (5,1) must be a mine.\n\n• Now look at the 3 at (5,2) (on row 5). Its neighbors include two already flagged mines ((4,2) and (6,3)) and two of the still-hidden neighbors are (5,1) and (6,1). Thus 3 – 2 = 1 hidden mine must be among (5,1) and (6,1).\n\n• Together the two equations (one from (4,1) and one from (5,2)) force a consistency:\n  – (5,0) + (5,1) = 1    and\n  – (5,1) + (6,1) = 1.\nThere are two options, but in either case when you then check the 3 at (6,2) (whose neighbors include (5,1), (6,1), and (7,1) among others) you find that to satisfy its count, the hidden cell (7,1) must be a mine in every possible case.\n\nSince no matter which possibility holds for (5,1) and (6,1) the cell at (7,1) is always forced to be a mine, we can safely mark (7,1) with a flag.\n\nThus the action that we now choose is to flag the cell at row 7, column 1.\n\nAnswer: flag (7,1)","flag (7,1)","Based on the current board configuration and using basic Minesweeper deduction, we can look at cell (7,2), which shows a “2”.

Since (7,2) says “2”, none of the remaining adjacent unknown cells can be mines.

One mine has already been flagged at (3,1). All the other adjacent cells have been uncovered and show a safe number – except for (5,2) which is still unknown. In order for (4,1) to have exactly 2 mines in its neighborhood, the only possibility is that (5,2) must be a mine. Therefore, the safe move is to flag the cell (5,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (5,2)","flag (5,2)","Based on the board information, we can make an inference using basic Minesweeper logic.

Since (12,1) shows 1 and one of its neighbors is flagged, none of the remaining unknown neighbors (i.e. (11,0), (11,1), (12,0), (13,0)) can be mines. Therefore, uncovering any one of those cells is safe. I chose (12,0).","uncover (12,0)","Answer: uncover (11,0)","uncover (11,0)","Based on the clues, we can deduce that (13,0) is safe to uncover. Here’s one of the key reasoning steps:\n\n• Look at the cell at (12,0) which shows “1”.

For example, consider the unknown cells at (10,0), (10,1) and (11,1) in the upper‐left part of the “?” region in row10–row11. Here are some of the deductions:\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Let\n  x = 1 if (10,0) is a mine (0 if safe),\n  y = 1 if (10,1) is a mine,\n  z = 1 if (11,1) is a mine.\n\nExamine these clues:\n • Cell (9,0) shows “1” and its unknown neighbors are (10,0) and (10,1). That forces\n   x + y = 1.\n • Cell (10,2) shows “1”. Its unknown neighbors are (10,1) and (11,1); hence\n   y + z = 1.\n • Cell (11,0) shows “1”. Its unknown neighbors are (10,0), (10,1) and (11,1); so\n   x + y + z = 1.\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Solve the equations:\n • From (9,0): x + y = 1.\n • From (11,0): x + y + z = 1 ⟹ (z) must be 0.\n • Then from (10,2): y + 0 = 1 ⟹ y = 1.\n • And finally, x + 1 = 1 ⟹ x = 0.\n\nThus, (10,0) and (11,1) are safe, while (10,1) must be a mine.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 3. (10,1) is deduced to be a mine so it is best to flag that cell.\n\nTherefore, the next move is:\n\nAnswer: flag (10,1)","flag (10,1)","Based on the board’s numbers and flags, we can deduce a safe move. Notice row 10 shows “? F 1 …” in its first three positions:\n • (10,0) is unknown,\n • (10,1) is flagged, and\n • (10,2) is “1.”\n\nLook at cell (10,2). Its eight neighbors include (10,1) which is flagged. Since (10,2) displays “1,” it is already “satisfied” by the flagged neighbor. That means all the remaining unknown neighbors around (10,2)—including (10,0)—must be safe to uncover.\n\nThus, a safe next action is to uncover (10,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (10,0)","uncover (10,0)","Based on the clues, the unknown at (11,1) can be deduced as safe.

Similarly, checking cell (11,2) with clue 1 confirms that (11,1) is the only remaining unknown and must not hide a mine.\n\nThus, the next move is:\n\nAnswer: uncover (11,1)","uncover (11,1)"],"unflags":0,"seed":19,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For example, consider the number 2 at coordinate (0,12). Its adjacent cells are:\n • Row 0: (0,11) which is a safe 0, (0,12) itself, and (0,13) which has already been flagged (F).\n • Row 1: (1,11) shows 0, (1,12) shows 2, and (1,13) is still unknown (?).\n\nThat “2” tells us that exactly two mines are present in its eight surrounding cells. We already have one flag at (0,13) and the other three known neighbors are safe numbers. This leaves (1,13) as the only candidate for the second mine.\n\nThus, we can safely deduce that (1,13) must be a mine and flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (1,13)","flag (1,13)","Answer: flag (15,2)","flag (15,2)","Based on a simple local deduction, consider the uncovered “1” at (4,9).

Therefore, the correct move is to flag (5,10).\n\nAnswer: flag (5,10)","flag (5,10)","Answer: uncover (0,14)","uncover (0,14)","Based on the adjacent clues I’ve deduced that cell (15,12) must be a mine. In particular, consider the cell at (16,11) whose value is 1. Its eight neighbors are almost all uncovered except for (15,12). Since none of those neighbors have been flagged yet, the only way to satisfy the “1” hint is if (15,12) is a mine. Thus, I will flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (15,12)","flag (15,12)","Based on the board analysis, consider row 15. Its cell at (15,5) shows a “2” and has exactly one flagged neighbor ((14,4) is flagged), with only one adjacent cell still covered at (15,6). Because (15,5)=2 already “sees” one flagged mine, the remaining unknown adjacent cell (15,6) must be a mine. Therefore, the safe logical move is to flag the cell at (15,6).\n\nAnswer: flag (15,6)","flag (15,6)","Looking at the board we can deduce a mine using local information. For example, consider the cell at (7,4) which shows a “2”.

The only cells that have not been revealed are (7,3) and (8,4). Since (7,4) indicates there must be 2 mines around it and exactly 2 neighbors remain unknown, both (7,3) and (8,4) must be mines.\n\nA safe next move is to flag one of these. For example, we can flag (7,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (7,3)","flag (7,3)","We can use a little basic deduction here. Look at the cell at (11,6) – on the board it shows a “2”. Its eight neighbors (using row, col offsets) are already uncovered except for two cells:\n• (10,7) is still unknown.\n• (11,7) is still unknown.\n\nAll the other neighbors of (11,6) (namely, row10’s columns 5 and 6; row11’s column 5; and row12’s columns 5, 6, and 7) are uncovered and show numbers. Since (11,6) is a 2 and it only touches two covered cells, those two covered cells must be mines. (This is the classic Minesweeper rule: if a number equals the count of still‐hidden neighbors, all those hidden cells are mines.)\n\nBecause (10,7) and (11,7) must be mines, a safe move is to flag one of them. (You might flag both as your deductions progress, but you only need to output one action at a time.)\n\nThus, a good next move is to flag (10,7).\n\nAnswer: flag (10,7)","flag (10,7)","Based on the board, notice that the entire bottom row (row 17) has all 0’s. Since a 0 means “none of the surrounding cells contain mines,” any unknown cell adjacent to a 0 must be safe. In particular, row 17, column 16 is a 0 and it touches row 16, columns 15–17. We see that row 16’s cells at (16,16) and (16,17) are still unknown (“?”). Because (17,16) (which is a 0) borders (16,16), we know (16,16) is safe.\n\nThus, the recommended move is to uncover cell (16,16).\n\nAnswer: uncover (16,16)","Answer: flag (11,7)","flag (11,7)","Based on a local deduction: look at cell (3,15), which shows a 1. Its adjacent cells (using only the eight immediately neighboring positions) are those in rows 2–4 and columns 14–16.

The displayed number 1 on cell (3,15) tells us there is exactly 1 mine among its neighbors. Since none of its already uncovered neighbors are mines and no mine has been flagged in this group, the single “?” (at (3,16)) must be a mine. \n\nThus a safe move is to flag cell (3,16).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,16)","flag (3,16)","Based on the board’s current deductions, consider cell (15,15) (row 15, column 15), which is marked as “1”. Its eight adjacent cells come from rows 14–16 and columns 14–16.

Since the “1” on (15,15) means there must be exactly one mine in its neighboring cells and (15,16) is the only unrevealed candidate there, we can conclude that (15,16) must be a mine.\n\nTherefore, the safe move is to flag (15,16).\n\nAnswer: flag (15,16)","flag (15,16)","Based on a careful look at the board we can deduce one safe flag. For example, examine cell (11,0) which shows a “1”. Its 3×3 neighborhood covers the cells in rows 10–12 and columns 0–1.

Look at row 8, column 5 (using 0‐indexing). Its value is 1 and its adjacent cells are the ones in rows 7, 8, and 9 and columns 4, 5, and 6. When you check these, you find that every neighbor is already revealed and safe except for the cell at (9,4), which remains unknown. Since the “1” tells you there is exactly one mine among the eight adjacent cells and no flags have been placed there yet, (9,4) must be a mine. \n\nThus, the correct move is to flag (9,4).\n\nAnswer: flag (9,4)","Answer: uncover (15,17)","uncover (15,17)","Based on a local analysis, consider cell (3,15) on the board.

It shows “1” and its eight neighbors include one flagged cell already (namely (11,1)). Since the number equals the count of adjacent flags, all the still-hidden (unknown) neighbors of (12,1) must be safe.

Its eight neighbors (actually only the ones existing on the board) are:\n • Row 5, columns 9–11: (5,9)=0, (5,10)=1, (5,11)=1  \n • Row 6, columns 9–11: (6,9)=0, (6,10)=1 (itself), (6,11)=?  \n • Row 7, columns 9–11: (7,9)=1, (7,10)=2, (7,11)=1\n\nAll adjacent cells are already revealed as safe except (6,11) which is still unknown. Since the clue in (6,10) is 1 there must be exactly one mine among its adjacent cells – and with (6,11) being the only unrevealed neighbor, it must be a mine.\n\nTherefore, the safest next move is to flag (6,11).\n\nAnswer: flag (6,11)","flag (6,11)","After some analysis, consider cell (9,2).

Similarly, the “1” at (8,2) also surrounds (9,2) as the sole unknown, reinforcing the deduction.\n\nTherefore, the correct move is to flag (9,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (9,2)","flag (9,2)","Based on looking at the board, we can focus on the clue at cell (2,2) which displays a 1.

That means (1,3) must be a mine. Flagging it is therefore a safe and logical move.\n\nAnswer: flag (1,3)","flag (1,3)","Answer: uncover (0,3)","uncover (0,3)","Based on the board information, we can deduce a safe move.

Since (4,8) shows a 1 and none of its already-known neighbors are flagged or known mines, the single unknown neighbor (3,9) must be a mine. Therefore, the safe move is to flag (3,9).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,9)","flag (3,9)","We can deduce a safe move by looking at the numbered clues. For example, look at the cell at (3,10).

Thus the unknown cell at (13, 0) must be safe. \n\nAnswer: uncover (13,0)","uncover (13,0)","Based on a careful look at the board we can deduce at least one safe “flag” move.

The cell (0,6) shows a 1 and its unknown neighbors are A and I. So\n  Constraint 1: A + I = 1\n\n2. The cell (1,6) also shows a 1 and sees the same pair A and I; so the above constraint holds.\n\n3. The cell (1,10) displays a 2. Its unknown neighbors are C, D, E, and K. Thus:\n  Constraint 2: C + D + E + K = 2\n\n4. The cell (1,13) displays a 2. Its unknown neighbors are F, G, and H.

According to the game’s score the flags correctly account for 9 mines. (Even though the original rules mentioned 10 mines, the score line “Flags: 9\/14” tells us that there are 14 mines in total, and therefore 5 mines remain hidden.) In the unknown cluster there are 11 cells and by definition the total remaining mines in that cluster must be 5.\n\nSumming up the mines in our unknown cells we have:\n (A + I) + (C + D + E + K) + (F + G + H) + B + J = 1 + 2 + 2 + (B + J) = 5 + (B + J).\n\nSince exactly 5 mines remain in the cluster, we have\n  5 + (B + J) = 5  ⟹  B + J = 0.\n\nThus, B = 0 and J = 0; in other words, both (0,8) and (1,8) are safe.\n\nA safe move is to uncover one of these cells. For example, we can choose to uncover cell (0,8).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,8)","uncover (0,8)","Based on the information we currently have, the only cells that still hide their true contents are in the “cluster” in the top‐two rows. (Row 0: columns 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14; Row 1: columns 7, 8, 9.) A short analysis shows that the five unknowns in a connected cluster (which we may label as follows)\n\n  • a = (0,7)    \n  • b = (1,7)    \n  • c = (1,8)    \n  • d = (1,9)    \n  • e = (0,9)\n\ntogether with the three unknowns that come from the cell adjacent to (1,10)=2\n\n  • f = (0,10)    \n  • g = (0,11)\n\nmust satisfy a set of constraints. For example, the number in cell (1,6)=1 tells us that\n  (0,7) [a] + (1,7) [b] = 1,\nso exactly one of a and b is a mine.\n\nOther numbered blocks (for instance, (0,8)=3, (2,8)=3, and (1,10)=2) similarly “cover” some of these unknowns. When you set up the equations for this cluster (after a bit of pencil‐and‐paper work) you find that there isn’t any cell that is 100% deducible as safe; rather in all candidate solutions one finds that some cells come out “mine” in 40–80% of the possibilities. In our quick count over all allowed assignments (there turn out to be 5 equally acceptable completions) the cells (0,7), (0,10) and (0,11) each have the lowest chance to be a mine (40% chance there is a mine—that is, 60% chance of being safe).\n\nAccordingly, the “safest” move (i.e. best chance of being correct) is to uncover one of those cells. I will choose (0,10).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,10)","uncover (0,10)","Based on the constraints we can derive from the numbered cells, we can “solve” the few unknown cells on the top two rows. For example, let’s label the still‐unknown cells as follows:\n\n Row0 unknowns:\n  A = (0,7)\n  B = (0,9)\n  C = (0,11)\n  D = (0,12)\n  E = (0,13)\n  F = (0,14)\n\n And row1 unknowns:\n  H = (1,7)\n  I = (1,8)\n  J = (1,9)\n\nNow, several numbered cells in rows 0 and 1 “touch” these unknowns. (Whenever a numbered cell has some “unknown” neighbors, the number tells us exactly how many mines must be among them.) For instance, consider the cell at (0,6) which is “1.” Its known neighbors are safe (0 or a number) except for (0,7) [A] and (1,7) [H]. Hence we deduce:\n  A + H = 1               (1)\n\nLikewise, the cell (0,8)=3 touches A, B, H, I, and J:\n  A + B + H + I + J = 3          (2)\n\nAnother example: the cell (0,10)=2 (and similarly (1,10)=2) has among its unknown neighbors B, C, and J:\n  B + C + J = 2               (3)\n\nExamining (1,11)=1 we see it touches two unknowns, (0,11)=C and (0,12)=D:\n  C + D = 1                 (4)\n\nAnd (1,13)=2 touches (0,12)=D, (0,13)=E, and (0,14)=F:\n  D + E + F = 2              (5)\n\nFinally (1,14)=1 touches (0,13)=E and (0,14)=F:\n  E + F = 1                 (6)\n\nSolving these equations step‐by‐step:\n\n• From (6): E + F = 1.\n• Then (5) becomes D + 1 = 2, so D = 1.\n• Using (4): C + 1 = 1, so C = 0.\n• From (3): B + C + J = 2 ⟹ B + J = 2. (Since C = 0, and with binary “mine or not” both B and J must be mines, so B = 1 and J = 1.)\n• Equation (1) tells us A + H = 1 (so one of A and H is a mine, but we cannot tell which).\n• Finally, substitute (1) and (3) into (2): (A + H) + (B + J) + I = 1 + 2 + I = 3 ⟹ I = 0.\n\nThus we deduce the certainty for some cells:\n B = (0,9) is always a mine.\n C = (0,11) is safe.\n D = (0,12) is a mine.\n J = (1,9) is a mine.\n I = (1,8) is safe.\nThe pair A\/H and the pair E\/F remain ambiguous (each pair must have exactly one mine), so we are not yet sure about them.\n\nSince you want to make a “safe” move, we can choose a cell we know is not a mine. For example, cell C = (0,11) is deduced to be safe.\n\nTherefore, the next recommended action is:\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,11)","uncover (0,11)","Answer: flag (1,9)","flag (1,9)","Based on the board, one promising deduction comes from inspecting cell (0,10), which shows a 2. Its neighbors include (0,9) – an unknown cell – and (1,9) which is flagged as F. Since (0,10)’s number tells us there must be exactly 2 mines adjacent, and we already have one flagged mine at (1,9), the only remaining possibility is that (0,9) is a mine. Therefore, a safe action is to flag cell (0,9).\n\nAnswer: flag (0,9)","flag (0,9)","Answer: flag (0,12)","flag (0,12)","Answer: uncover (1,8)","uncover (1,8)","After carefully scanning the board, I see that the only remaining unknown cells appear in the top two rows. In particular, there are four unknown cells:\n • (0,7)\n • (0,13)\n • (0,14)\n • (1,7)\n\nLooking at the numbers around the unknowns (for example, (0,8) shows a 3 and touches both (0,7) and (1,7); likewise, (1,6) shows a 1 and touches these two), we can deduce that exactly one of the cells (0,7) and (1,7) must be a mine. A similar “pair” situation exists with (0,13) and (0,14).\n\nBecause no adjacent number gives a 100% guarantee of safety for any one unknown – each is in an ambiguous pair – any move among these carries some inherent risk. In such cases (a common situation in Minesweeper), one must make a guess.\n\nI choose to take the guess on cell (1,7). If it happens not to be the mine, uncovering it will provide further information to resolve the ambiguity. (If it turned out to be a mine, then the game would be over—but with no deduction that eliminates a 50\/50 chance, a guess is needed.)\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,7)","uncover (1,7)"],"unflags":0,"seed":7,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}

For example, look at the uncovered cell at (2,3) showing a “1”. Its unknown neighbors are (1,2), (2,2), and (3,2). Now, also note the uncovered cell at (3,3) which is also “1” and touches only (2,2) and (3,2) among its unknown neighbors. For (3,3) to be correct, exactly one mine must be in (2,2) and (3,2). That forces (1,2) (which is adjacent to (2,3) but not to (3,3)) to be safe—because if (1,2) were a mine, then (2,3) would have at least 2 mines among its three unknown neighbors. \n\nThus, (1,2) appears to be a guaranteed safe cell.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,2)","uncover (1,2)","Based on the board, we can deduce one move.

Because the “1” indicates exactly one mine in its adjacent cells and no flags have been placed among these neighbors yet, (7,4) must be a mine.\n\nTherefore, the correct move is to flag cell (7,4).\n\nAnswer: flag (7,4)","flag (7,4)","Answer: uncover (6,6)","uncover (6,6)","Answer: uncover (8,4)","uncover (8,4)","Based on the board, we can deduce one safe flag move.

That leaves exactly one mine unaccounted for, and the only unknown neighbor is at (9,4). Therefore (9,4) must be a mine, and you should flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (9,4)","flag (9,4)","Based on the board state, we can make a safe deduction. Look at cell (6,4) which shows a 1. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n • Row 5: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)  – all revealed  \n • Row 6: (6,3) and (6,5)    – both revealed  \n • Row 7: (7,3) revealed as 1, (7,4) flagged (F), and (7,5) still unknown\n\nSince (6,4) displays “1” and exactly one of its neighbors—(7,4)—is flagged, the rule “if a numbered cell’s adjacent flags equal its number then the other unknown neighbors are safe” applies. Therefore, (7,5) must be safe to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,5)","uncover (7,5)","Based on the numbers around the unknown cells we can make a logical deduction. For example, consider the cell at (4,5) which shows a 1. Its unknown neighbors are (3,7), (4,6) and (5,6) (the other neighbors around (4,5) are already revealed as safe or numbered). This 1 means exactly one mine is among these three cells.\n\nNow look at the cell at (5,5) which also shows a 1. Its unknown neighbors are (4,6), (5,6) and (6,7). (Again, all other neighbors of (5,5) are revealed.) It, too, requires exactly one mine in its unknown neighbors.\n\nBecause the two groups share (4,6) and (5,6), notice what would happen if neither (3,7) nor (6,7) were safe (i.e. if the mine did not lie in the overlapping part). Then each numbered cell would have to “find” its single mine outside the common pair. That would force both (3,7) and (6,7) to be mines, yielding 2 mines (one for each) which contradicts the number 1. Therefore the only way for both (4,5)=1 and (5,5)=1 to hold is that the only mine among the union lies in (4,6) or (5,6). In other words, both (3,7) and (6,7) must be safe.\n\nThus, we can safely take an action on one of those cells. For instance, we choose to uncover (3,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,7)","uncover (3,7)","Answer: flag (2,7)","flag (2,7)","We can sometimes “read” a Minesweeper board so that a numbered cell’s mine–count forces a set of its border unknown cells to have a specific number of mines. In our board many of the unknown clusters seem to be “tied” together by pairs or triplets that could hide 50–50 mines. However, note the cell at (6,6) which shows a 1 and touches exactly five unknown cells. Its eight‐cell neighborhood is already almost complete:\n • (6,6)=1 has as neighbors (in rows 5–7, columns 5–7) the following:\n  – Row 5: (5,5)=1, (5,6)=?, (5,7)=?\n  – Row 6: (6,5)=1, (6,7)=?\n  – Row 7: (7,5)=2, (7,6)=?, (7,7)=?\nNone of these have been flagged yet. Therefore the “1” on (6,6) tells us that exactly one mine must be among these five unknown cells [(5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7)]. Even though we cannot say “for sure” that a particular one is a mine, by symmetry each is, logically, less likely (about 1 in 5 chance) to be the mine than cells which belong to pairs that must hide one mine (50% chance for each in that pair). \n\nBy comparing that with other regions of the board (for example, the pair of unknowns beside (4,5) and (5,5) or the pair beside (8,4)) we see that an unknown cell that is only in the five‐cell group of (6,6) should be among the “safest” picks.\n\nAs one example, cell (6,7) is in that five–cell unknown group. (Its neighbors are (5,6), (5,7), (6,7), (7,6), (7,7), and the “1” at (6,6) means exactly one of these five is a mine.) That gives (6,7) roughly an 80% chance of being safe, which is the best we can deduce from the current information. \n\nThus a good next move is to uncover (6,7).\n\nAnswer: uncover (6,7)","uncover (6,7)","We can use logic on the revealed numbers. For example, focus on the almost‐complete “1” shown in the lower–middle area. Look at cell (8,8) (row 8, column 8) which shows “1”. Its eight neighbors are almost all revealed except for (7,7). In fact, the only unknown neighbor of (8,8) is (7,7) (all other adjacent cells are uncovered and known not to be mines). Since the number “1” means exactly one mine is adjacent, cell (7,7) must be a mine.\n\nNow use that information on cell (8,7) (which is a “1”). Its neighbors include (7,6) and (7,7) (among others that are already safe). Because we now know (7,7) is a mine, (8,7)=1 already “sees” that mine. Therefore, none of its other unknown neighbors can be mines. In particular, cell (7,6) must be safe.\n\nThus, a logically safe move is to uncover cell (7,6). \n\nAnswer: uncover (7,6)","uncover (7,6)","Based on the available logic, one can deduce a safe move. For example, consider the group of unknown cells around the middle‐area. In one consistent possibility the “pair” around (4,6), (3,8), and (5,6) works out as follows:\n\n• Look at cell (3,6)=2. Its neighbors include a flagged cell at (2,7) and the two unknowns (3,8) and (4,6). Thus (3,6)=2 tells us exactly one mine is among (3,8) and (4,6).\n\n• Next, look at cell (4,5)=1. Its neighbors (which include the unknowns (4,6) and (5,6)) mean that exactly one of those is a mine.\n\nIf we assume the “shared” cell (4,6) is the mine, then both (3,8) and (5,6) turn out to be safe. (Other candidate assignments lead to a mine‐count among the unknown cells that would be too low overall.) Checking other numbered cells (for example, (2,8)=2 and its adjacent cells) confirms that the “(4,6) is mine” hypothesis is consistent with all counts.\n\nThus one safe move is to uncover (5,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,6)","uncover (5,6)","Based on our deductions, we can make one move with certainty. Here’s a brief reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at cell (8,6) with value 2, its eight neighbors (in rows 7–9 and cols 5–7) include exactly two unknown cells: (7,7) and (8,5). (7,7) and (8,5) must both be mines.\n2. Examining cell (7,5)=2 (whose neighbors are rows 6–8, cols 4–6) confirms that (8,5) is forced to be a mine (when you count the one flagged neighbor).\n3. Then, from cell (8,6) the only remaining unknown neighbor becomes (9,5). Since (8,6) requires exactly two mines and we already have them (at (7,7) and (8,5)), cell (9,5) must be safe.\n\nThus a safe move is to uncover (9,5).\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,5)","uncover (9,5)","Answer: flag (4,6)","flag (4,6)","Answer: flag (8,5)","flag (8,5)","Looking at cell (3,7) which shows a 2, we see its eight neighbors are:\n • Row2: (2,6)=1, (2,7)=F, (2,8)=2;\n • Row3: (3,6)=2, (3,8)=?

Since the clue “1” tells us the total mines among its adjacent cells is exactly 1 and we already have that flag, all the other neighboring unknowns must be safe.\n\nThus, we can confidently uncover one of these unknowns.

Its eight neighbors include (16,13), which is already flagged, and two still–unknown cells (among others that are already uncovered). Because (15,13) shows “1” and the flag at (16,13) already accounts for that one mine, every other yet–hidden neighbor touching (15,13) must be safe.

In the current board those neighboring squares are (with their coordinates):\n\n • In row 11: (11,12), (11,13), and (11,14)  \n • In row 12: (12,12) and (12,14)  \n • In row 13: (13,12), (13,13), and (13,14)\n\nIf you look at the board, all those cells are already uncovered numbers except for (13,14). (They show 0’s, 1’s, etc.) Since the clue is “1” and no mines are flagged among these, the only possibility is that the only mine adjacent to (12,13) must be in the lone unrevealed block (13,14). \n\nThus, you can safely deduce that (13,14) is a mine and flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (13,14)","flag (13,14)","I’m going to choose a cell in the unknown “bottom‐right” area that isn’t immediately involved in a tight 50\/50 cluster. In our board the only cells that have not been “touched” lie in the lower rows (rows 11–16). Several cells in the cluster around row 11–13 are involved in two‐way “balance” equations (for example, the four unknowns in row 11 and the one in row 12 are linked by the 2’s and 1’s so that in one possibility one cell is a mine and in the other possibility a different cell is the mine). In that cluster, no cell is “guaranteed safe” by logic alone.\n\nBy contrast the very last cell in the bottom–right corner, (16,16), is part of the unknown group in the bottom‐right but it is “less constrained” (its only neighbors are a few still–unknown cells in row 15 and 16). In other words, though we cannot “prove” (16,16) is safe with 100% certainty, choosing it minimizes the immediate risk compared with picking one of the 50\/50 cells. (When playing Minesweeper, if no guaranteed moves exist one usually “gambles” on the cell that appears to have the lowest risk.)\n\nSo my action is to uncover (16,16).\n\nAnswer: uncover (16,16)","uncover (16,16)","Based on a careful look‐at the clues in the lower–right part of the board, I noticed the following deduction.

Hence among these four cells exactly one must hide a mine.\n\n• Next, the cell at (17,16) also shows “1” and its neighbors (it touches only three cells because it is at the bottom‐edge) are (16,15), (17,15) and (16,16) (which is already uncovered). So (17,16)=1 tells us that exactly one mine is hidden in the pair { (16,15), (17,15) }.\n\nSince the only mine that could account for (16,16)’s “1” is now forced to lie in (16,15) or (17,15), it follows that the other two cells accessible to (16,16)—that is, (15,15) and (15,16)—cannot be mines.

For example, consider the cell at (2,10), which shows a “1”. Its unknown neighbors are (1,11) and (2,11). Meanwhile, the cell (3,11) also shows “1” and its two unknown neighbors are (2,11) and (2,12). There are two possible assignments:\n\n• Either (2,11) is the mine – then (1,11) (from (2,10)) and (2,12) (from (3,11)) must be safe.\n• Or (2,11) is safe – forcing both (1,11) and (2,12) to be mines.\n\nIf we count overall unknowns (11 cells in this part of the board) and know that only 3 more mines are hiding (since 7 have been flagged out of 10), the possibility that two out of these three cells are mines implies a density of around 66% in that tiny group. That is much higher than the overall chance. (In contrast, having only one mine among the three cells is much more plausible.) \n\nThus, by a standard Minesweeper “small–group” probability consideration the safer (and more likely) assignment is that (2,11) is a mine. To confirm consistency: \n\n– Cell (2,10) = 1 would then have its one mine among {(1,11), (2,11)} identified (with (2,11) flagged), so (1,11) becomes safe.\n– Likewise, cell (3,11) = 1 would “see” the flagged mine (2,11) so (2,12) must be safe.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a good next move is to mark (2,11) as a mine.\n\nAnswer: flag (2,11)","flag (2,11)","Answer: uncover (9,3) \n\nAnalyzing the board, consider the uncovered cell at (8,3) which shows a 1. Its eight neighbors include the flagged cell at (7,3) (which is marked F) and several revealed numbers, with (9,3) being the only unknown around it. Since the cell’s value is 1 and its only flagged neighbor is (7,3), no additional mines can be adjacent. That guarantees that (9,3) is safe, so the next move is to uncover (9,3).","uncover (9,3)","Based on the current numbers, one deduction stands out. Look at row1, column10 which shows a “2”. Its adjacent cells are:\n\n • Row0: (0,9) is flagged, (0,10) = ? and (0,11) = ?  \n • Row1: (1,9) shows a 1 and (1,11) = ?  \n • Row2: (2,9) is 0, (2,10) is 1, (2,11) is flagged, and (2,12) = ?  \n\nThat “2” must count exactly two mines among its eight neighbors. With mines already flagged at (0,9) and (2,11), no other neighboring cell can be a mine. In other words (0,10), (0,11), (1,11), and (2,12) must be safe.\n\nA safe next move is therefore to uncover one of these cells. For example, we can choose (0,10).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,10)","uncover (0,10)","Based on the clues from the surrounding numbered cells, we can deduce one safe cell. For example, look at the cell (1,2) which shows a “2.” Its adjacent cells are:\n • (0,1) – Unknown\n • (1,1) – Unknown\n • (2,1) – Unknown\nplus cells that are already uncovered or flagged (including a flagged mine at (2,3)). In the group of unknown cells (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1), exactly one mine is needed to satisfy the “2” (since one mine is already flagged adjacent to (1,2)). Also, examining cells (0,0) and (0,2) (both “1”)—each has (0,1) and\/or (1,1) in its vicinity—implying that exactly one of (0,1) and (1,1) must be a mine. With these two pieces of information, (2,1) can’t be the extra mine; it must be safe. \n\nThus, we can confidently uncover cell (2,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,1)","uncover (2,1)","Based on the clues around (2,12), we can deduce that it is safe to uncover that cell. For example, note that the number 1 at (1,12) (its adjacent cells are (0,11)=0, (0,12)=0, (1,11)=1, (2,11)=F, and (2,12)=?) already has one flagged mine (at (2,11)), so (2,12) must be safe. \n\nAnswer: uncover (2,12)","uncover (2,12)","Based on a quick logical analysis of the board, consider row 10. Its row is shown as:\n  0 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nNote that only the cell at (10,3) is still unknown in that row. Look at one of its adjacent numbered cells—for example, the cell at (10,2) which is “1”. Its adjacent cells are (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (10,1), (10,3), (11,1), (11,2) and (11,3). All are uncovered (and known safe)\nexcept for (10,3). Since (10,2)’s clue is exactly 1 and there are no flagged mines among its eight neighbors, the only possibility is that the unknown neighbor at (10,3) must be a mine. (A check using the cell at (10,4) gives an identical deduction.) \n\nTherefore, the safe action is to flag (10,3).\n\nAnswer: flag (10,3)","flag (10,3)","After carefully analyzing the clues, we see that only two cells remain “unknown”: (0,1) and (1,1). Look at the nearby clues:\n\n• (0,0) shows 1 and its adjacent cells are (0,1), (1,0) and (1,1). Since (1,0) is already uncovered and safe, one of (0,1) or (1,1) must be a mine.\n• (0,2) also shows 1 and has (0,1), (0,3), (1,1) and a few other uncovered neighbors. Again the only unknowns are (0,1) and (1,1); exactly one must be a mine.\n• (1,2) is 2, and among its adjacent cells the only unknown ones are (0,1) and (1,1) (the rest are either uncovered or flagged—with one flag already placed at (2,3)). So again, exactly one mine is in these two cells.\n\nAll these clues are consistent: between (0,1) and (1,1) there is exactly one mine. Unfortunately, nothing in the current information distinguishes which one is safe. In Minesweeper this is a typical 50\/50 situation.\n\nMany players choose to make a “guess” move here. In this case you have two equivalent options:\n • Uncover one of them, risking that you hit the mine (50% chance of game over), or\n • Flag one of them, which may (if you’re correct) let you complete the board safely later.\n\nSince we already have 9 correct flags (and there must be 10 mines in total), flagging one of these cells to “complete” our mine marking is a natural choice. (Later the remaining unknown cell — if unflagged — would be safe).\n\nI’ll choose to flag (0,1) as the mine.

For example, note that:\n\n• The cell at (1,1) shows “2” and its eight neighbors include three unknown cells in row 0 –\n  (0,0), (0,1) and (0,2) – while the rest are already uncovered.\n• Similarly, the cell at (1,2) also shows “2” and its neighbors include the three cells (0,1), (0,2) and (0,3).\n\nSince both (1,1) and (1,2) require that exactly two of their neighboring cells are mines, the common cells (0,1) and (0,2) must be mines. (Why? Because if, say, one of these were safe then one of the groups couldn’t reach its total of 2 mines.) \n\nThen look at (1,0) which shows “1.” Its neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) and (2,0)\/(2,1) (which are already uncovered and safe). Since we now know (0,1) is a mine, (0,0) must be safe.\n\nThus we have reasoning enough to act safely on (0,0). (Other deductions even suggest that (0,3) would be safe and (0,5) would be a mine, but one move is needed now.)\n\nSo our next move is to uncover the definitely–safe cell (0,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)","uncover (0,0)","Based on the current board, let’s examine cell (1,0).

The best move is to flag (0,1).\n\nAnswer: flag (0,1)","flag (0,1)","Based on the uncovered numbers, we can deduce a safe move. For example, look at cell (1,1) which shows a 2. Its eight neighbors are: \n • (0,0) = 1  \n • (0,1) = F (flagged)  \n • (0,2) = ?  \n • (1,0) = 1  \n • (1,2) = 2  \n • (2,0) = 0  \n • (2,1) = 0  \n • (2,2) = 0  \n\nOnly one adjacent cell remains unknown, (0,2), and since (1,1) requires 2 total mines it already counts the flagged at (0,1), (0,2) must be a mine. Therefore, we can safely flag (0,2).\n\nAnswer: flag (0,2)","flag (0,2)","Answer: uncover (0,3)","uncover (0,3)","Based on the number clues already on the board, we can make a safe deduction. For example, consider the top‐row cell (0,3) which shows “1”. Its 8 neighbors include (0,2) which is flagged and (0,4) which is still unknown. Since (0,3)=1 and one adjacent mine is already flagged (at (0,2)), that means all its other neighbors must be safe. Therefore, (0,4) is safe to uncover.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,4)","uncover (0,4)","Answer: flag (4,6)","flag (4,6)","We can use logical constraints from two adjacent clues. Notice the following:\n\n• The cell (2,5) is uncovered and shows “1.” Its eight neighbors include exactly three covered cells at (1,6), (2,6) and (3,6) (all the other neighbors are already uncovered or flagged). That “1” means exactly one of those three cells is a mine.\n\n• Immediately below, the uncovered cell (3,5) shows “2.” Its eight neighbors include a flagged mine at (4,6) and exactly two covered ones at (2,6) and (3,6) (the other neighbors are already open and known). Since “2” already accounts for the flagged mine, the remaining two covered cells must contain exactly one more mine.\n\nIf we let x, y, and z denote the mine indicator (1 = mine, 0 = safe) for (1,6), (2,6), and (3,6) respectively, then from (2,5) we have:\n  x + y + z = 1\nand from (3,5):\n  y + z = 1\nSubtracting the second from the first shows x = 0.\nThat is, cell (1,6) is guaranteed not to be a mine.\n\nThus a safe move is to uncover (1,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,6)","uncover (1,6)","Answer: uncover (3,6)","uncover (3,6)","Based on the board we see a useful deduction around the cell at (2,10).\n\nStep 1: Look at cell (2,10). It is revealed as “1” and its eight neighbors are mostly revealed except one:\n • Its neighbors in row1 are (1,9), (1,10) and (1,11) – all showing 0.\n • In row2 the neighbors (2,9) is 0 and (2,11) is “1.”\n • In row3 the neighbors are (3,9)=0, (3,10)=1 and (3,11) which is “?” (unknown).\n\nStep 2: Since (2,10)=1 has no flagged mines among its already revealed neighbors, the only candidate to contribute the “1” is the unknown (3,11). There’s exactly one unknown neighbor, so (3,11) must be a mine.\n\nStep 3: According to the rules you can “flag” a cell that you deduce is a mine.\n\nSo the best move is to flag the cell at (3,11).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,11)","flag (3,11)","Based on the deductions from the board, a promising move is to use the 1 on row 3, column 10. Its value “1” tells us that exactly one mine is touching it. Looking at its eight neighbors, we see that the only mine-flag already set is at (3,11). Since that flag “accounts” for the lone mine, every other neighboring covered cell must be safe. One of those is (4,11).\n\nThus, a safe move is to uncover cell (4,11).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,11)","uncover (4,11)","Based on a quick deduction, consider the cell at (2,6).\n\nLook at the uncovered number at (1,7), which is 1.

With that certain logical inference, your next move should be to flag (2,6).\n\nAnswer: flag (2,6)","flag (2,6)","Answer: flag (11,5)","flag (11,5)","Based on the current board, one deduction can be made using the cell at (0,4).\n\n• The cell at (0,4) is revealed and shows a 1.\n• Its neighbors are:\n  – (0,3): Revealed (number 1)\n  – (0,5): Unknown (?)\n  – (1,3): Revealed (number 1)\n  – (1,4): Revealed (number 1)\n  – (1,5): Revealed (number 2)\n• There’s no flagged mine among these neighbors yet, and (0,5) is the only unknown neighbor.\n• Since (0,4) has a value of 1, exactly one mine must be present among its neighbors.\n• Therefore, (0,5) must be a mine.\n\nSo the safest move is to flag cell (0,5).\n\nAnswer: flag (0,5)","flag (0,5)","I’ve deduced a safe move using local logic. Look at the number 2 at cell (5,11). Its eight neighbors are:\n • Row4: (4,10)=2, (4,11)=3, (4,12)=?\n • Row5: (5,10)=?, (5,12)=1\n • Row6: (6,10)=2, (6,11)=1, (6,12)=0\n\nAll of these except (4,12) and (5,10) are uncovered (and there are no flagged mines among these yet). Since the number 2 at (5,11) must have exactly 2 mines around it and there are exactly 2 still‐unknown neighbors, both (4,12) and (5,10) must contain mines. (Note that this deduction uses the common Minesweeper “when unknown count equals remaining mines” idea.)\n\nChoosing one of these moves, a correct action is to flag (4,12).\n\nAnswer: flag (4,12)","flag (4,12)","Based on the current configuration, I noticed that the cell at (2,11) displays a “1.” Its eight neighbors are:\n\n• Row 1: (1,10) = 0, (1,11) = 0, (1,12) = 0  \n• Row 2: (2,10) = 1 and (2,12) = 2  \n• Row 3: (3,10) = 1, (3,11) = F, and (3,12) = ?  \n\nSince (3,11) is already flagged, that “1” is fully accounted for, which means none of the other unknown neighbors can be mines.

Since the cell’s value is 3, there must be exactly one more mine among its remaining (unknown) adjacent neighbors.\n – The only neighbor that is still “?” is (5,10).\n\nTherefore, (5,10) must be a mine and the correct move is to flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (5,10)","flag (5,10)","Looking at the board we can find a spot where a number’s “required‐mines” are already flagged, meaning that any still‑covered neighbors must be safe.

That gives exactly 1 flagged mine adjacent to (6,4). Since the 1 is fully “accounted for” by the flag at (5,4), none of the remaining unknown neighbors – including (5,3) – can be mines.

Looking at that area we see that (5,4) is flagged and all the other neighbors are numbers (already uncovered) except (6,3) and (7,3) which are still “?”. The clue “1” at (6,4) means exactly one mine appears in its neighborhood. Since there is already a flag at (5,4), no other neighbor can be a mine. Thus both (6,3) and (7,3) are safe.

For example, look at cell (1,0) which shows a “2.” Its neighbors are:\n • (0,0): uncovered with 0  \n • (0,1): uncovered with 1  \n • (1,1): uncovered with 3  \n • (2,0): flagged (F)  \n • (2,1): still unknown  \n\nThree of these are uncovered and known to be safe and one (at (2,0)) is already flagged as a mine. Since the “2” means there must be exactly 2 mines around (1,0) and we already have 1 flag at (2,0), it follows that (2,1) must also be a mine in order to satisfy the count. \n\nSo the next move is to flag cell (2,1).\n\nAnswer: flag (2,1)","flag (2,1)","Answer: uncover (2,2)","uncover (2,2)","Based on the clues we have, there’s no move that guarantees 100% safety. However, notice that the only numbered clue with almost all of its neighbors revealed is the 2 in row2 col2. Its six unknown neighbors (cells (1,2), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) and (3,3)) must contain exactly one mine. In contrast, the 3 in row1 col1 forces exactly one mine among its two remaining unknown neighbors ((0,2) and (1,2)), giving a roughly 50% chance for those cells. Choosing a cell that is only in the 2’s area avoids that high (50%) risk.\n\nAmong the six cells in the 2’s neighborhood the ones that appear only there (and not involved in the tighter 50–50 group) are (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2) and (3,3) – though of course they “share” one mine among them. That means each has, on average, about a 1⁄6 chance (~17%) of being a mine. \n\nFor example, (3,1) is one of these cells and does not appear in any 50\/50 situation (unlike (1,2)). While there is no absolute guarantee in Minesweeper, (3,1) is a relatively “safer” guess given the current information.\n\nThus, the move we choose is to uncover (3,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,1)","uncover (3,1)","Based on the current board, the immediate region in the top‐left has some intertwined uncertainties. For example, from cell (0,1) (which shows 1) the only unknown neighbors are (0,2) and (1,2) – meaning one of those must hide a mine. In other words, in that “cluster” the chance of picking a safe cell is pretty much around 50%. Meanwhile the vast remainder of the board (rows 4–12 and the far right in rows 0–3) has no direct clues indicating danger; here the only “prior” is roughly the overall mine density (about 17 mines remaining spread among over 160 unknown cells, roughly an 10% chance).\n\nTo lower our immediate risk while still progressing the game, it is reasonable to probe an unknown cell that is far removed from the already–exposed region.

Consider the cell at row 8, column 12. Its already‐uncovered value is 1. (Recall the board’s rows and columns are 0-indexed.) Now, what are its adjacent cells? They are:\n • In row 7: cells (7,11) and (7,12)\n • In row 8: cell (8,11) (besides (8,12) itself)\n • In row 9: cells (9,11) and (9,12)\n\nFrom the board we see that (7,11) is flagged (“F”), (8,11) is uncovered as 2, (9,11) is uncovered (value 1), and (9,12) is uncovered (value 0). Thus, (8,12)’s only “unknown” neighbor is (7,12).\n\nBecause (8,12) shows the number 1 and already has one adjacent flag at (7,11), the mine count for its neighborhood is already accounted for. In Minesweeper, if a numbered cell has exactly as many flagged neighbors as its number, every other adjacent unknown cell must be safe. Therefore, (7,12) is safe to uncover.\n\nSo the move is:\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,12)","uncover (7,12)","We can deduce a safe move. For example, consider the “1” at (1,6).

Since the “1” means exactly one mine is among its neighbors, we have\n\n  D + I + L = 1          (“1” in (1,6)).\n\nNow, look at the “1” at (0,6). Its adjacent cells are:\n • Row0: (0,5)=D and (0,7)=0;\n • Row1: (1,5)=I, (1,6)=1, and (1,7)=0.\nSo here the only unrevealed neighbors are (0,5) and (1,5) — so\n\n  D + I = 1.\n\nComparing these two equations, we have (D + I + L = 1) and (D + I = 1), which forces\n\n  L = 0.\n\nThat is, the unknown at (2,5) (which we denoted L) must NOT be a mine. It is safe to uncover.\n\nTherefore a valid move is to uncover (2,5).\n\nAnswer: uncover (2,5)","uncover (2,5)","Based on the local deductions in the top‐left “unknown” cluster, one region stands out. Look at the two adjacent number cells on row 4 and row 5:\n\n• The cell at (4,6) shows “2”. Its eight neighbours (in the 3×3 block around it) include three still–covered cells: (3,5), (4,5) and (5,5). (All other neighbours are already uncovered or are known to be safe – see row3 col6 =1, row3 col7 =0, row4 col7 =0, row5 col6 =1, row5 col7 =0.) Therefore, (3,5), (4,5), and (5,5) must together contain exactly 2 mines.\n\n• Now look at (5,6) which is “1”. Its neighbours in the upper‐right 3×3 block include (4,5) and (5,5) (the other cells are already open). Since (5,6) shows 1 the pair {(4,5), (5,5)} must contain exactly 1 mine.\n\nBecause (4,5) and (5,5) together account for one mine and (3,5),(4,5),(5,5) (from (4,6)=2) must have two mines, the only possibility is that the cell (3,5) must be a mine.\n\nThus a safe—logically deduced—action is to flag (3,5).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,5)","flag (3,5)","Based on a look at the board, we can make one safe deduction. Consider the cell at (6,6) – it shows the number 1. Its eight neighbors (those immediately adjacent in every direction) are all revealed except for one:\n\n• In row 5 (the row immediately above row 6), the cells at (5,5) is still unknown while (5,6) is revealed as 1 and (5,7) as 0.\n• In row 6, the cells at (6,5) and (6,7) are revealed (showing 1 and 0, respectively).\n• In row 7, all cells in columns 5, 6, and 7 are revealed.\n\nThus (6,6)’s only adjacent unknown is (5,5). Since (6,6) is labeled 1 and there are no flags yet surrounding it, the only possibility is that the unknown cell (5,5) is a mine. In Minesweeper logic, if a numbered cell’s value equals the sum of already flagged cells plus the unknown cells in its neighborhood, all those unknowns must be mines.\n\nTherefore, the correct safe action is to mark (5,5) with a flag.\n\nAnswer: flag (5,5)","flag (5,5)","Based on the current board, we can make a safe deduction.

Since (6,3) is 1 and we already have 1 flag among its neighbors, it means that neither (5,3) nor (5,4) can be a mine—they are safe to uncover. \n\nThus, one safe move is to uncover (5,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,3)","uncover (5,3)","Answer: uncover (3,4)","uncover (3,4)","From our deductions we can make a safe move. For example, consider the clues on cells (0,6) and (1,9):\n\n• The cell at (0,6) shows a 1. Its only adjacent unknown cells are (0,5) and (1,5).  \n• Separately, looking at the “2” at (2,3) and its neighbors we deduced that among the four unknowns—including (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,4)—exactly 2 must be mines. In addition, the “2” at (2,2) (whose unknown neighbors are (1,2) and (1,3)) forces exactly one mine among those two. This in turn tells us that of the two unknown cells (1,4) and (2,4) exactly one is a mine.  \n• Then by considering the “2” at (2,5) (with unknown neighbors (1,4), (1,5) and (2,4) while one adjacent cell is already flagged) we find that (1,4) and (2,4) already account for the remaining one mine, which forces (1,5) to be safe.\n\nSince uncovering a safe cell is our best move, we choose to uncover (1,5).\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,5)","uncover (1,5)","Based on the board’s clues, we can make a safe move.

Look at cell (2,6) on row 2 which shows a 1. Its neighbors are:\n\n • From row 1: (1,5), (1,6), (1,7) – all uncovered and safe  \n • From row 2: (2,5) and (2,7) – both already uncovered (with 2 and 0, respectively)  \n • From row 3: (3,5), (3,6), (3,7)\n\nAmong these, (3,6) and (3,7) are uncovered (showing 2 and 1). That leaves only (3,5) as an unknown neighbor. Since cell (2,6) indicates there is exactly 1 mine adjacent and (3,5) is the only candidate, (3,5) must be a mine.\n\nTherefore, the safe action is to flag cell (3,5).\n\nAnswer: flag (3,5)","flag (3,5)","Based on the clues shown on the top rows we can deduce something about the three unknown cells to the right of the top‐center numbers. Look at these cells:\n\n• In row 0 the uncovered cell at (0,8) shows “1”. Its neighbors (ignoring cells outside the board) include (0,9) and (1,9) as unknowns (since all its other neighbors are already uncovered and safe). Thus there is exactly 1 mine among (0,9) and (1,9).\n\n• In row 1 the cell at (1,8) shows “2”. Its neighbors include (0,9), (1,9), and also (2,9) (plus other already known cells). This “2” tells us that the total mine count among these three unknown cells is 2.\n\nIf we let\n  x = 1 if (0,9) is a mine, 0 otherwise,\n  y = 1 if (1,9) is a mine, 0 otherwise,\n  z = 1 if (2,9) is a mine, 0 otherwise,\nthen from the (0,8)=1 clue we have:\n  x + y = 1.\n\nAnd from (1,8)=2 we have:\n  x + y + z = 2.\nSince (x + y) is 1, it follows that z must be 1. In other words, (2,9) is a mine.\n\nNow consider (2,8), which is “1”. Its neighbors include (1,9), (2,9), and also (3,9) (besides other uncovered cells). With (2,9) already deduced as a mine, the “1” clue implies that\n  y + (the mine-status of (3,9)) = 0.\nThus neither (1,9) nor (3,9) can be mines (i.e. they are safe) and also from x + y = 1 with y = 0 we get x = 1—that is, (0,9) must be a mine.\n\nIn summary:\n  (0,9) → mine  (1,9) → safe  (2,9) → mine  (3,9) → safe\n\nA safe move is to flag the cell we deduced as a mine.

In order for the count “2” at (2,5) to be correct, and with one flag already in (3,5), the cell (3,4) must be a mine.\n\nTherefore, the logically safe move is to mark (3,4) with a flag.\n\nAnswer: flag (3,4)","flag (3,4)","Looking at the board, notice cell (0,8) shows a 1.

Because (3,3) already “sees” its lone mine flagged at (3,4), the remaining unknown neighbors (namely (4,2) and (4,3)) must be safe.

Since the displayed number is 1 and we already have one flag adjacent, all the remaining unknown\/covered adjacent cells must be safe.

Since the cell shows 4, exactly one more mine must be present among its neighbors. The only neighbor that remains unknown is (5,4). Therefore, (5,4) must contain a mine.\n\nAction:\nAnswer: flag (5,4)","flag (5,4)","I will analyze the board step‐by‐step:\n\nOne key technique is to use the “flag–safe” rule: if an uncovered numbered cell already touches as many flagged blocks as its number, then every remaining adjacent “?” must be safe to uncover.\n\nLet’s look at the uncovered cell in row 4, column 4. (Remember the coordinates are zero‐indexed, so row 4 is the 5th row.) Its value is 3. Its adjacent cells are (using (row, col) notation):\n\n • From the row above (row 3): (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)  \n • From the same row (row 4): (4,3) and (4,5)  \n • From the row below (row 5): (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nWhen we inspect these neighbors we see that three of them are already flagged: (3,4), (3,5) in row 3 and (5,4) in row 5 are marked F. That makes 3 flags. Since the cell’s number is 3, it means that all of its mines have been found. Consequently every other adjacent block that is still unknown can be safely uncovered.\n\nIn this case the only “?” left beside (4,4) is (5,3). This is therefore a safe move.\n\nThus, the best next action is:\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,3)\n\nYou can now input this move in the Minesweeper game.","uncover (5,3)","Answer: flag (5,2)","flag (5,2)","We can use a common Minesweeper deduction.

For example, consider the cluster of unknown cells in the top‐left part of the middle region:\n\n• Cell (2,0) shows “1” and its adjacent cells are (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) (all safe zeros or low counts that have already been revealed) and the two unknown cells (3,0) and (3,1). Thus exactly one mine must be among (3,0) and (3,1).\n\n• Now look at cell (3,2) which shows “1”. Its adjacent cells include known ones (from row2 and row3 “1”s) and two unknowns: (3,1) and (4,1). Therefore, exactly one mine exists between (3,1) and (4,1).\n\n• Next, cell (4,2) is “2”. Its neighborhood covers: from row3 – (3,1) (unknown), (3,2) and (3,3) (both known); from row4 – (4,1) (unknown) and (4,3) (known); from row5 – (5,1) (unknown), (5,2) which is flagged (F) and (5,3) (a “2”). Since one mine is already flagged (at (5,2)), the remaining required mine count in this group is 2 – 1 = 1. But we already have that the unknowns among these are exactly (3,1), (4,1) and (5,1) and from the deduction above cell (3,2) tells us one mine is in (3,1)+(4,1). That forces (5,1) to be safe because if (5,1) were a mine, there would be too many mines around the “2” at (4,2).\n\nThus, we know (5,1) is safe.

Since (7,4)’s number tells you there is exactly 1 mine among its (up to) eight neighbors and none of its already–exposed neighbors are mines, the only cell that can hide that mine is (8,5).\n\nThus you know with certainty that (8,5) must hold a mine.\n\nFollowing the rules, you should flag it.

Its unknown neighbors are (8,1), (9,1) and (10,1) (the other surrounding cells being already uncovered). So exactly two mines are hidden among (8,1), (9,1) and (10,1).\n\n3.

Its eight neighbors are: \n\n • In row 8: (8,1), (8,2) and (8,3)  \n • In row 9: (9,1) and (9,3)  \n • In row 10: (10,1), (10,2) and (10,3)\n\nLooking at the board these cells are:\n – (8,2) = 1, (8,3) = 0 (known)  \n – (9,1) = 2 and (9,3) = 0 (known)  \n – (10,1) is flagged (“F”), (10,2) = 1 and (10,3) = 0 (known)  \n\nThat leaves only (8,1) as an unknown neighbor. Since (9,2) displays 2 and already one flagged cell (10,1) is adjacent, the remaining mine must be (8,1) – no other unknown can account for the remaining mine. \n\nThus, we confidently decide to flag cell (8,1).\n\nAnswer: flag (8,1)","flag (8,1)","Based on the board’s current numbered clues, one safe deduction comes from the clue at (9,1). That cell shows a 2 and has exactly two adjacent flagged cells. Its eight adjacent cells are:\n\n • Row 8: (8,0), (8,1), (8,2)\n • Row 9: (9,0), (9,2)\n • Row 10: (10,0), (10,1), (10,2)\n\nAmong these, (8,1) and (10,1) are flagged. Since (9,1)’s number (2) is already “accounted for” by these two flags, it follows that the remaining unknown adjacent cells – namely (8,0), (9,0), and (10,0) – cannot be mines. In other words, they are safe to uncover.\n\nFor our move we can choose one of these cells. For example, we can choose (8,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,0)","uncover (8,0)","Based on a local deduction, consider cell (8,0). It shows a 1 and its neighbors are:\n • (7,0): ?\n • (7,1): ?\n • (8,1): F (flagged)\n • (9,0): ?\n • (9,1): 2\n\nSince (8,0) is 1 and there’s already one flagged cell at (8,1), the remaining unknown neighbours ((7,0), (7,1) and (9,0)) must be safe. For a conservative next move we can choose one of these. For example, uncovering (7,0) is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,0)","uncover (7,0)","Analyzing the board, consider cell (8,0) which shows a “1.” Its neighbors are:\n • (7,0): 2 (already uncovered)\n • (7,1): ? (unknown)\n • (8,1): F (flagged)\n • (9,0): ? (unknown)\n • (9,1): 2 (already uncovered)\n\nSince the “1” at (8,0) already touches one flagged cell and has a value of 1, no additional mines can be among its other adjacent cells. That means the unknown cells (7,1) and (9,0) must be safe.\n\nA safe move is to uncover one of these cells. For example, we can choose to uncover (7,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (7,1)","uncover (7,1)","After analyzing the board, consider cell (8,0) which shows a “1”. Its neighbors are:\n • (7,0) = 2  \n • (7,1) = 2  \n • (8,1) = F  \n • (9,0) = ?  \n • (9,1) = 2\n\nSince (8,0)’s value of 1 is already accounted for by the flagged cell at (8,1), all its remaining unknown neighbors must be safe. The only unknown here is (9,0).\n\nTherefore, a safe next move is:\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,0)","uncover (9,0)","We can deduce one move by “reverse‐engineering” one number’s adjacent counts. For example, look at the tile at (6,2) which shows a 2. Its immediately adjacent cells are: \n\n • Row 5: cells (5,1)=2, (5,2)=F, (5,3)=2  \n • Row 6: cells (6,1)=? (unknown), (6,3)=2  \n • Row 7: cells (7,1)=2, (7,2)=2, (7,3)=0  \n\nNotice that among these eight neighbors, there is already one flagged cell (at (5,2)). The number on (6,2) is 2, so it must have exactly 2 mines in its neighborhood. With one mine already flagged, exactly one of the remaining unknown cells must be a mine. In this case the only still–unknown neighbor is (6,1) (all the others around (6,2) are uncovered numbers). \n\nTherefore, (6,1) must be a mine and it is safe (logical) to flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (6,1)","flag (6,1)","Answer: uncover (5,0)","uncover (5,0)","Based on our deductions, we can make a safe move. For example, look at cell (5,0) which shows a 1.

Thus, uncovering any one of these three cells is safe. I choose to uncover (4,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,0)","uncover (4,0)","Answer: uncover (3,0)","uncover (3,0)","Based on the board layout, we can deduce a safe move. For example, look at the cell at (5,1) which shows a 2. Its neighbors include two already flagged cells at (5,2) and (6,1); the remaining adjacent cells at (4,1) and (6,0) (both still “?”) are not flagged. Since (5,1) already has the required two flags, the other covered neighbors must be safe. Therefore, it is safe to uncover either (4,1) or (6,0).\n\nI will choose to uncover (4,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,1)","uncover (4,1)","Answer: flag (3,1)","flag (3,1)","Answer: uncover (6,0)","uncover (6,0)","Based on the information we can deduce a safe cell to click. For example, consider cell (9,0) which shows a “2.” Its immediate neighbors are:\n\n• From row8: (8,0)=1, (8,1)=F, (8,2)=1  \n• From row9: (9,0)=2 (itself), (9,1)=2  \n• And from row10: (10,0)=? and (10,1)=F, (10,2)=1\n\nBecause (9,0) requires exactly 2 mines adjacent and it already sees two flags – one at (8,1) and one at (10,1) – the remaining unknown neighbor (10,0) must be safe.\n\nThus, a logically safe move is to uncover cell (10,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (10,0)","uncover (10,0)","Based on the board’s many nearly‐complete regions, almost every “unknown” cell is caught in a tangle of interdependent clues. In our current unknown region (the lower‐right corner), there are 7 still–covered cells. Detailed analysis of the numbered clues tells us that one “small” block (the three cells in row 8 from column 7 to column 9) must contain exactly one mine—so that set has a 1-in-3 chance for any one cell to hide a mine (≈33% risk, 67% safe). In contrast, the other unknown block (the four cells at positions (7,10), (8,10), (9,10) and (10,10)) contains 2–3 mines (a roughly 50% chance that any one cell there is safe). \n\nAlthough no move is logically “forced” safe—that is, nothing can be deduced with 100% certainty—our best “guess” move (the one with the highest likelihood of being safe) is to pick one from the three‐cell group. In particular, uncovering cell (8,7) gives you roughly a 67% chance to hit a safe spot and may soon help clarify the surrounding cluster further.\n\nThus, the recommended action is:\nAnswer: uncover (8,7)","uncover (8,7)","We can deduce a safe flag by “reading” the numbers around the unknown cells in the bottom‐right corner. (For clarity, we label the six unknowns as follows, with their board coordinates:)\n\n  A = (7,10)\n  B = (8,8)\n  C = (8,9)\n  D = (8,10)\n  E = (9,10)\n  F = (10,10)\n\nLet’s look at a few key numbered cells:\n\n1. The cell at (7,9) shows “2”. Its eight neighbors include some already‐cleared cells and exactly four unknowns: A, B, C, and D. Since no adjacent flag exists among those neighbors, the equation is:\n  A + B + C + D = 2     (“+” here means the number of mines in these cells)\n\n2. The cell at (9,9) shows “2”. Its unknown neighbors are B, C, D, E, and F. Again, with no extra flags there:\n  B + C + D + E + F = 2\n\n3. The cell at (10,9) shows “1”. Its unknown neighbors are only E and F, so:\n  E + F = 1\n\nNow, inserting the third equation into the second one we have:\n  B + C + D + 1 = 2 ⟹ B + C + D = 1\n\nThen return to the first equation:\n  A + (B + C + D) = 2. Since we’ve deduced B + C + D = 1, it follows that\n  A = 2 – 1 = 1.\n\nIn Minesweeper “1” here means that cell A must be a mine. Since A is at coordinate (7,10), you can confidently flag it.\n\nThus, your next action is:\n\nAnswer: flag (7,10)","flag (7,10)","Answer: flag (8,8)","flag (8,8)","We can use some local logic here. Look at cell (7,9) – it displays 2.

Since (7,9) shows a 2, it means exactly 2 mines exist in its adjacent cells. Already, there are 2 flags adjacent. Therefore, the remaining unknown cells (8,9) and (8,10) cannot be mines – they must be safe.\n\nA safe move is to uncover one of these cells. For example, you could choose to uncover (8,9).\n\nAnswer: uncover (8,9)","uncover (8,9)","Based on our analysis, note cell (8,9) is showing a 2. Its adjacent cells include two flagged cells at (7,10) and (8,8) and two unknown cells at (8,10) and (9,10).
