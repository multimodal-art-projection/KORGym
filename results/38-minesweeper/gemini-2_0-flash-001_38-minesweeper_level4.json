Specifically, consider the top left corner:\n\n```\n? 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n```\n\nBased on this, I can uncover cell (0, 0), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3). However, choosing (0,0) might lead to immediate exposure to mine. Thus, I will uncover (0,3) as it is highly probable that the cell is safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,3)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and make a strategic decision.\n\nCurrently, we have a lot of unknown cells. The numbers on the board represent the number of adjacent mines. Let's look for locations where a '1' is adjacent to only one unknown cell.\n\nConsider the cell (0, 5). It is adjacent to a '1' at (0,1). This '1' must mean that the cell (0,5) has a mine in it.

Since 'uncover (3,3)' shows a '1' too and we know the 2 blocks to the right could have a mine close by, lets try uncovering a relatively safe cell:\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,0)\n","The current board state gives us some useful information. The rows with numbers (rows 3-7) are surrounded by question marks, meaning there are likely mines around them. Specifically, the '1's and '0's offer good starting points. Looking at row 3, we see '1 2 1 1 1 2'. In row 4, we see '0 0 0 0 2'. The '0' values indicate safe zones. Based on this, let's uncover a cell near the '0's, specifically in the area where we see rows of zeros. I'll pick a cell two rows above those zeros.\n\nAnswer: uncover (1,3)\n","uncover (1,3)","Based on the current board state, let's analyze the situation. We can see several numbers that give us clues about mine locations.\n\nSpecifically, look at the first row. We have \"1 1 0 1\". This indicates the following:\n- Cell (0,1) has one adjacent mine.\n- Cell (0,2) has no adjacent mines.\n- Cell (0,3) has one adjacent mine.\n\nConsider the second row \"3 1 2\".\n- Cell (1,1) has three adjacent mines.\n- Cell (1,2) has one adjacent mine.\n- Cell (1,3) has two adjacent mines.\n\nThe \"0\"s in rows 4, 5, 6, and 7 are useful to uncover.\n\nGiven the current information and the constraints of the game, let's choose a safe cell to uncover. Based on row 1, cell (0,2) has a value of 0, meaning there are no mines around it. Let's uncover one of the adjacent cells, say (1,2), to gather more information. Since this already has a value of 1. Let us explore around the '0' regions.\nThere is a large zero region starting from (4,0) to (6,0), thus (4,1), (5,1) and (6,1) are also safe and thus we can uncover these blocks.\n\nTherefore, let's uncover (4,1).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,1)\n","Based on the board state, we can infer some information.\n- The top row has '1 0 1' which suggests the adjacent cells could be safe.\n- The numbers provide clues about the number of mines around them.\n\nGiven the current state and the goal to safely uncover cells, a reasonable approach is to uncover cells adjacent to the known numbers, especially if those numbers are low.\n\nLooking at the '1' at (3, 2) and (3, 4) surrounded by other numbers, there is likely no mine around them. So let's uncover (3, 4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, we can deduce some information. The numbers on the board indicate the number of adjacent mines. Let's analyze the known cells:\n\n- (0,1) = 1: One mine in the surrounding cells.\n- (0,2) = 0: No mines in the surrounding cells.\n- (0,3) = 1: One mine in the surrounding cells.\n- (1,1) = 3: Three mines in the surrounding cells.\n- (1,2) = 1: One mine in the surrounding cells.\n- (1,3) = 2: Two mines in the surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at the (0,2) = 0, we know that (0,1), (0,3), (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (0,0), (1,0) cells don't have mines.\nLooking at the (0,1) = 1 and the fact (0,2) = 0, we know that one of the following blocks has a mine: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,2). But we know (0,0), (1,0), (0,2) do not have mines. Thus, (1,1) must have a mine, but we know the cell (1,1) doesn't have a mine!\nError.\nLet us look at row 4 (index 3) and row 5 (index 4). (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4) have values 1, 2, 1, 1, 1 and (4,0), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4) have values 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. From (4,0) to (4,3) being 0, we know (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (5,0), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3) are safe. Since (3,4) = 1, and (4,2),(4,3),(4,4) are already uncovered with safe cells(0 mines), the (3,4) means (2,4) and (4,4) contains a mine. But we know (4,4)=2, so the logic is wrong.\n\nGiven (3,0) = 1, and (4,0) = (4,1) = (4,2) = (4,3) = 0. The only possible mine is at (2,0), (2,1),(3,1)\n\nLet's consider the area around (1,1) = 3. It has many unknowns.\nLet's consider uncovering a safe cell. Since we know (4,0) to (4,3) is 0, let's explore around (5,4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,4)","Based on the current board state, we can deduce some information. The numbers indicate the number of adjacent mines.

Thus (0,1), (1,1), and (1,2) are safe. This information is already uncovered and consistent.\n- Consider '1' at (0,1). This implies one of the neighbors around (0,1) contains mine. The neighbor are: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1) and (0,2) which is '0'.\n\nLooking at row 2: \"? 3 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?\"\n\n- '1' at (1,2) neighbors are (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).\n- '3' at (1,1) neighbors are (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nLooking at row 4: \"1 2 1 1 1 2 ? ? ? ? ? ?\"\n\n- The '1' at (3,0) suggests that at least one of the neighbors: (2,0), (2,1), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) has mine.\n- The '2' at (3,1) suggests that two of the neighbors: (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) has mines.\n\nConsidering the provided information, the cell (3,4) neighbors the 1 at (3,3), 1 at (3,5), 1 at (4,3), 2 at (4,4), 1 at (4,5), etc. Let us explore the area around (3,4).\nLet's uncover (3,4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, the following logic can be applied to deduce safe moves:\n\n*   **Column 2:** We have a '1' in row 0, a '3' in row 1, and '2' in row 3, '0' in rows 4,5,6, and '1' in row 7.

The cells marked with \"0\" are definitely safe. Let's focus on areas where we have numbers close to known safe cells.\n\nLooking at the top left, we see \"1 1 0 1\".

This suggests the cells to the left and right of '1 0 1' have a high probability of being safe.\nLooking at row 2, we have '3 1 2'. This also suggests high mine probability in the adjacent cells.\n\nThe cell (3, 4) has '1 1 1 2' around it. It's adjacent to a '2', but that might not mean much yet. Let's look at surrounding zeros to reveal more information.

Since the '1' indicates only one mine in the neighborhood, the cell at (4, 2) MUST be a mine. Let's flag that.\n\nLet's look at row 4: \"1 2 ? 1\". The '2' at (4, 1) must have two mines around it. We've identified that (4, 2) is a mine, so now let's consider the cell (5, 0) and (5, 1). Since the cell (5, 2) is '3', it needs 3 mines surrounding it. It seems very likely that (5, 0) and (5, 1) are mines.\n\nLet's flag (4,2), (5,0), and (5,1).\n\nGiven the current state and the constraint of 11 total mines, it's risky to flag multiple mines. Let's try uncovering a safe cell first.\nThe '1' at (3, 4) means that none of its neighbors can be mines, so let's uncover (3, 4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and make a strategic move.\n\nCurrent Board State:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\n1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\n? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\n? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n? ? 1 1 1 3 ? ? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nReasoning:\n\n1.  **Focus on Known Areas:** We have some numbers revealed, indicating the number of adjacent mines. Let's start by focusing on those.\n2.  **Row 3 (index 2):** We have \"1 1 1\". This row is safe to expand horizontally away from the '1' blocks.\n3.  **Row 4 (index 3):** We have \"1 1 1\". This row is safe to expand horizontally away from the '1' blocks. We also see a '?' at (3, 10) and (3, 11).\n4.  **Row 5 (index 4):** We have \"1 2 ? 1\". Since there is a 2 here with one known adjacent mine, we can assume that the \"?\" is a mine. This might not be true but could be our next move.\n5.  **Row 6 (index 5):** We have \"3 2 1\".\n\nGiven the available information, the safest move is to uncover a cell adjacent to a known number that hasn't been explored yet. Let's try to uncover (3, 4).\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Okay, let's analyze the current board state and deduce the best action.\n\nCurrent Board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\n1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\n? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\n? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n? ? 1 1 1 3 ? ? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\nWe can deduce information from the numbers on the board.  Let's focus on areas where a number has few surrounding unknown cells.\n\n*   Row 3:  `1 ? ?` -  The '1' at (3, 9) has two unknowns next to it. This means at least one of those must be a mine, but we don't know which one yet.\n*   Row 4: `? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0` - This row looks more promising. The '1' at (4, 6) is next to `1 ?` and `1`. It can't give us definite knowledge.\n\nLet's focus on the '1' at (3, 3). It has revealed the surrounding cells (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4). Since the value is '1', there is only one mine in these cells. From what we know so far it's not possible to determine the location of the mine in any surrounding cell.\n\nThe '1' at (4, 9) has 1 in the adjacent positions (3,8), (3,9), (3,10), (4,8), (4,10), (5,8), (5,9), (5,10). So the total number of mines should be one. Since the value in (3,9) is one and the number of adjacent positions that has '?' is two (3,10) and (4,10). Therefore, one of the them must be mine.\n\nLet's examine Row 3 again. We have `1 ? ?`. It's adjacent to a '1' at (4,9), a '1' at (4,10) and a '1' at (4,11). There is an unknown at (3,10) and (3,11).\nWe need to find a safe square to uncover. Let's re-examine the first few rows, as they are all '0'.  Let's try (0,0).\n\nAnswer: uncover (0,0)\n","Based on the current board state and the Minesweeper rules, I will try to deduce a safe move.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?\n1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\n? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\n? ? 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n? ? 1 1 1 3 ? ? ? ? 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 2 1 1 1 0\n? ? ? ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n- At (3,1), we have '1'. The adjacent cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) has 1 mine already. Then all blocks are safe.\n- At (3,2), we have '1'. The adjacent cells (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,3), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) has 1 mine already. Then all blocks are safe.\n- At (4,1), we have '2'. Adjacent cells include (3,0) (3,1) (3,2) (4,0) (4,2) (5,0) (5,1) (5,2)\n- At (5,4), we have '1'. Adjacent cells include (4,3) (4,4) (4,5) (5,3) (5,5) (6,3) (6,4) (6,5)\n- At (7,2), we have '2'. The adjacent cells (6,1) (6,2) (6,3) (7,1) (7,3) (8,1) (8,2) (8,3) has 2 mines. Then all blocks are safe.\n\nBased on this, I will uncover (3,4) which is 0.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and decide on the best action.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   **The Board:** A partially revealed Minesweeper board.\n*   **Mines Left:** 10 total mines, and we've flagged 0.\n*   **Objective:** Either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells.\n\nLooking at the board, we can see a few areas of interest:\n\n1.  **Row 3 (index 2):** \"0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\" This row has a few revealed numbers and a promising set of consecutive \"1\"s.\n2.  **Row 4 (index 3):** \"1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\" This row has a '?' block at (3, 2), and a '2' next to it. This suggests there is one mine among (2,1),(2,2),(3,1).\n3.  **Row 5 (index 4):** \"? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0\". A '3' at (4,2) surrounded by unknown cells.\n\nGiven this, let's focus on Row 3 and Row 4.\n*Row 3's consecutive \"1\"s indicate that there are no mines adjacent to those 1's.\n*Row 4 has the pattern \"1 2 ? 1 0\". The '2' at (3,1) means there are 2 mines surrounding it, and since (3,0) has a '1', we have one mine in (2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(3,2),(4,0),(4,1). Since (3,3) has '1' then (3,2) has no mine. Then we could try to uncover it.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I will uncover (3,2).\n\nANSWER: uncover (3,2)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and deduce a safe move.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   **Row 3:** `0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ? ?` The '1' at (3,1) and the '1' at (3,2) are satisfied, meaning there are no mines around them that are unflagged. The '1' at (3,3) is also satisfied. This means, there is one mine for either (3, 10) or (3, 11).\n*   **Row 4:** `1 2 ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1`The '1' at (4,0) is satisfied, meaning there are no mines around that that are unflagged.

Since (3, 1) and (3, 2) are 1's, we know that the mines are located at (5,0) and (5,1) or (3, 10) and (3, 11).\n*   **Row 5:** `? ? 3 2 1 0 1 ? 1 0 0 0`\n*   **Row 6:** `? ? ? ? 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0`\n*   **Row 8:** `? ? 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0` The \"1\" at (8,2) is satisfied meaning there are no mines around that that are unflagged. The \"1\" at (8,5) is satisfied.\n*   **Row 9:** `? ? 1 1 1 3 ? ? ? ? 1 0`\n\nNotice that cell (3,4) is '0', which means there are no mines around that.

The cells (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) are its neighbors.\n- Similarly, the '1' at (3,2) has one mine in its neighborhood.

Since its adjacent cells (3,0), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2) contain values, this indicates that there is potentially 1 mine amongst these adjacent locations.\nAlso we can infer from '1' at (3, 4). It has one mine amongst (2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,3),(3,5),(4,3),(4,4),(4,5).

Rows 1 and 2 also have '1' at column 5. Row 3 has a '1' at column 5. Row 4 has '1' at column 5. Row 5 has '1' at column 5. Row 6 has '1' at column 4 and 5. Row 7 has '1' at column 4. Row 8 has '1' at column 4 and 5. Row 9 has '1' at column 1. Row 10 has '1' from column 1 to 4. Rows 11, 12 have '1' at column 4.\n\nThe presence of '1' values along with zeros in nearby cells suggests there may be a safe move around them. Looking at row 3, column 3 has '0'. Then row 4 and 5 also have '0' at column 3. It seems safe to uncover (3,4) which is '0'.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, there are a few promising areas to explore. Let's focus on the regions where numbers are already revealed and can potentially provide information about the surrounding cells.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **(0,6) has value '1'**: This means there is one mine among the 8 surrounding cells. Some of these surrounding cells are known to be safe. We don't have enough information from here yet.\n2. **(1,5) has value '1' and (1,6) has value '2'**: Similarly, too many unknown cells.\n3. **(3,0), (3,1), (3,2) have value '1'**:  This is a good location. The cells are (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,0), (4,1), (4,2). (3,3) is a 0. (4,3) must be safe.\n4. **(4,2), (5,2), (6,2) have value '1'**: Not enough information yet.\n5. **(6,4), (6,5), (6,6) have value '1'**: Not enough information yet.\n6. **(8,1) has value '1'**: (7,0), (7,1), (7,2), (8,0), (8,2), (9,0), (9,1), (9,2)\n\nBased on these considerations, I will uncover (4,3).\n\nAnswer: uncover (4,3)\n","Based on the current board state, there are several areas that seem relatively safe to explore. Let's focus on the top-left corner where we have a lot of '0's revealed. The cell (3,4) is surrounded by zeros, so it is likely to be safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, I see a few promising areas to explore. The top left corner has a lot of revealed cells with low numbers, indicating a relatively safe zone. I will try uncovering a cell adjacent to known numbers to potentially reveal more safe cells.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, let's analyze the situation.  We have a lot of unknowns (\"?\") and some revealed numbers indicating adjacent mines.\n\nLooking at the top-left corner, there's a '1' at (0,6). This '1' is adjacent to two unknowns: (0,7) and (1,7). A quick glance shows the '2' at (1,6) is adjacent to the same two unknowns: (0,7) and (1,7) and also (2,7). This means one of those is a mine and the other isn't. Let's investigate further down the board.\n\nThe '2' at (3,6) has multiple unknowns around it: (2,6), (2,7), (3,7), (4,6), (4,7).\nThe '1' at (5,6) has unknowns around it: (4,6), (4,7), (5,7), (6,6), (6,7).\nThe '1' at (6,4) has unknowns around it: (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (6,3), (6,5), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5).\n\nThe '1' at (8,1) combined with '1' at (9,1) and '1' at (10,1) makes the cell (10,0) seem safer to uncover. Let's try that.\n\nAnswer: uncover (10,0)\n","uncover (10,0)","Okay, let's analyze the board and make a move.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   The board is 9x9.\n*   There are 10 mines.\n*   We need to either flag all mines correctly or uncover all safe cells.\n*   We have made 0 flags and 0 unflags so far.\n*   Current score is 0.0.\n\nLooking at the board, we can see some safe areas we can explore. The '0's indicate that there are no adjacent mines.\nWe can start by uncovering a cell that is surrounded by zeros.\n\nLet's try uncovering (3, 4), which is currently a '0'.\n\nANSWER: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, I will prioritize uncovering cells that have a high probability of being safe. Looking at the known numbers, I will start with cells adjacent to the '1's.\n\nSpecifically, I see a '1' at (5,6). Adjacent to it is (5,5), which hasn't been uncovered yet. Since all other adjacent cells have been discovered and are safe, that means that the cell (5,5) must be safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,5)\n","Based on the current board state and the Minesweeper rules, here's my reasoning for the next action:\n\n*   **Safe Zones:** We need to identify areas where we can safely uncover cells. Look at the numbers already revealed. For example:\n    *   The '1' at (0, 6) tells us there's one mine in the surrounding 8 cells. Since many of those are already revealed safe (0s), we can deduce the remaining unknowns are safe, or the flagged cells are correct.\n\n*   **Prioritize Low Numbers:** Start with the numbers '1' and '2'.  They give us the most immediate information.\n\n*   **Deduction:** The '2' at (1,6) is interesting. It touches several unknown cells.\n\nLet's examine the '1' at (0,6) more closely. Its neighbors are (0,5),(1,5),(1,6),(1,7),(0,7) and (0,6). Since it's already adjacent to one flagged mine candidate, 'flag (0,7)', the other adjacent unknown cells are safe.\n\nTherefore, let's try to uncover the cell at (0,5).\n\nANSWER: uncover (0,5)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and make a move.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   **Numbered Cells:** Give us information about adjacent mines.\n*   **'?' Cells:** Represent unknown locations.\n*   **Objective:** Uncover safe cells and flag mines.\n\nLooking at the board, here's the logic I'll apply:\n\n1.  **Scan for 1s next to '?' cells:** Look for cells with the number '1' where there is only one adjacent unknown cell. This indicates that the unknown cell is likely a mine.\n2.  **Scan for 2s next to '?' cells:** Look for cells with the number '2' where there are only two adjacent unknown cells. This indicates that the unknown cells are likely mines.\n\nBased on the board, I see several possibilities, but let's start with the cell at (0,6) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (0,7) and (1,7). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (1,6) which has a value of 2. The adjacent unknown cells are (1,7), (2,6) and (2,7). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (3,0) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (2,0), (4,0), (4,1). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (5,0) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (4,0) and (4,1). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (6,4) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (7,5). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (8,1) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (9,0). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (10,0) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cells are (9,0) and (11,1). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (11,2) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (11,3). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's examine the cell at (12,2) which has a value of 1. The adjacent unknown cell is (12,3). We can't make a determination yet.\n\nLet's try uncovering a cell that is far away from any known mines.\n\n```\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n```","Based on the current board state, I will try to uncover a cell that is likely safe. Looking at the numbers on the board, there are several locations with low numbers of adjacent mines. I'll choose to uncover (3,4) as it is surrounded by '0's and '1's.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, I'll try to uncover a safe cell. The cell at (3,4) is likely safe since it's surrounded by revealed '0' cells.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, I will try to uncover a safe cell. The cell at (3,4) appears to be safe, as there are zeros surrounding it.\n\nAnswer: uncover (3,4)\n","Based on the current board state, I'll focus on areas where I can deduce safe cells. The numbers indicate the number of adjacent mines, so I will uncover cells around these numbers that are not yet determined and are likely safe.\n\nSpecifically, focusing on the row at index 3, column indices 0 to 6, we have the pattern `1 1 1 0 0 1 2`.  This suggests several areas might be safe to uncover if the adjacent cells are not already marked. Particularly, the two `0` in this pattern appear to be surrounded by safe cells.\n\nHowever, a better approach given the information is row index 9. The pattern there is `? 1 0 0 0 0 1 ? ? ? ? ? ?`. The zeros suggest there are likely safe cells. I will uncover cell (9,2) as it is likely safe.\n\nAnswer: uncover (9,2)\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and decide on the best action.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\n*   **Safe Zones:** The areas with revealed numbers (0, 1, 2) are safe to explore around. We need to be strategic in expanding from these known safe zones.\n*   **Potential Mines:** The question mark areas are unknown, and could potentially contain mines.\n*   **Objective:** Uncover safe cells to reveal more information and identify potential mine locations.\n\nBased on the board, I see a few promising areas to explore:\n\n*   **Row 3:**  The \"2\" at (1,6) touches multiple unknown blocks.\n\nLet's try uncovering one of the blocks adjacent to the \"2\" at (1,6) to hopefully open up the board a bit.
