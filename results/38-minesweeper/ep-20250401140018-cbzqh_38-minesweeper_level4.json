The '3' at position (7,10) is interesting:\n   - It has 2 flagged mines adjacent (positions (6,10) and (8,10) are both '?', but we can see from the score that only 1 mine is flagged so far, so this can't be correct)\n   - Actually, looking at the board more carefully, there seems to be some inconsistency in the display (the board appears to have more columns than a standard 9x9 grid). \n\n3. A safer approach would be to look at the clear patterns:\n   - The '1' at (7,9) suggests there must be exactly one mine in its adjacent uncovered cells. The only adjacent uncovered cell is (8,10), so we can flag that.\n\n4. Also, the '1' at (6,9) has only one adjacent uncovered cell - (7,10), which must be a mine.\n\nHowever, given the current flag count (1\/19) seems inconsistent with the board state (there appear to be more flags than that), I'll make a conservative move by uncovering a cell that's clearly safe based on the numbers.\n\nLooking at position (4,10) which is '1':\n- It already has one adjacent mine (the flag at (3,11)), so all other adjacent cells must be safe.\n- We can uncover (5,11).\n\nAnswer: uncover (5,11)","Let's analyze the current board state and determine the safest move.\n\n1. First, let's look at the revealed numbers and see where we can deduce mine positions or safe cells.\n\n2. In the 7th row (row index 6), we see \"2 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3 2 1\". \n   - The '3' at position (6,9) has two adjacent unknown cells: (5,9) and (7,9). \n   - Currently, it has two flagged mines (we can see F at (5,8) and another flag somewhere), but since we don't see all flags, let's look elsewhere.\n\n3.

Therefore, all other adjacent cells must be safe.\n\n4. This means (5,6), (5,7), (6,6), (6,8), (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) are safe to uncover. The safest would be one that might give us more information.\n\n5.

At (16,2): '1' with only one unknown adjacent cell at (15,2) - this must be a mine\n2. At (17,7): '1' with only one unknown adjacent cell at (16,7) - this must be a mine\n3. At (18,7): '2' with two unknown adjacent cells at (17,7) and (19,7), but we already know (17,7) is a mine from above, so (19,7) must also be a mine\n4. At (19,6): '1' with two unknown adjacent cells at (18,6) and (19,7), but (19,7) is already a mine, so (18,6) must be safe\n\nTherefore, the safest move is to uncover (18,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (18,6)","To solve this Minesweeper puzzle, let's analyze the current board and identify safe moves or potential mines.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Numbers and Adjacent Cells**: Numbers indicate how many mines are in the adjacent 8 cells. We can use these to deduce where mines must be.\n2. **Flags (F)**: These are cells we've marked as mines. We need to ensure these are correctly placed.\n3. **Uncovered Cells**: These give us information about adjacent mines.\n\n### Key Areas to Analyze:\n1. **Row 6 (0-indexed, so the 7th row from the top)**:\n   - Cell (6, 6) is '?', and cell (6, 7) is '2'. The '2' at (6,7) already has one mine accounted for by the 'F' at (7,7), so there must be one more mine adjacent to (6,7). The only possible cell is (6,6). Thus, we can flag (6,6) as a mine.\n   \n   - Cell (6,13) is '?', and cell (6,12) is '1'. The '1' at (6,12) already has a mine adjacent at (7,13), so (6,13) must be safe. Thus, we can uncover (6,13).\n\n2. **Row 7**:\n   - Cell (7,13) is '?', but it must be a mine because the '1' at (6,12) and '1' at (7,12) imply it's the only possible mine in that area. However, it's already flagged, so no action needed here.\n\n3. **Row 8**:\n   - Cell (8,11) is '?', and cell (8,10) is '1'. The '1' at (8,10) must have one mine adjacent, which can only be (8,11). Thus, we can flag (8,11).\n\n4. **Row 11**:\n   - Cell (11,8) is '?', and cell (11,7) is '1'. The '1' at (11,7) must have one mine adjacent, which can only be (11,8). Thus, we can flag (11,8).\n\n5. **Row 12**:\n   - Cell (12,11) is '?', and cell (12,10) is '1'. The '1' at (12,10) must have one mine adjacent, which can only be (12,11). Thus, we can flag (12,11).\n\n### Immediate Safe Move:\nFrom the above, the safest move is to uncover (6,13), as it is guaranteed to be safe based on the number at (6,12).\n\n### Answer:\nAnswer: uncover (6,13)","Let's analyze the current board to determine the safest move.\n\nLooking at the bottom part of the board (rows 14-18), there are several interesting patterns:\n\n1.

In row 17:\n   - There's a \"2\" at (17,7) which is adjacent to (16,7) (unknown), (16,8) (unknown), and (17,8) (unknown)\n   - The \"1\" at (16,6) already accounts for one mine in this area (at (15,6))\n   - This suggests that among (16,7), (16,8), and (17,8), there must be exactly one more mine\n\n3. In row 18:\n   - There's a \"1\" at (18,6) which is adjacent to (17,6) (unknown) and (17,7) (unknown)\n   - The \"2\" at (17,7) suggests there are two mines in its adjacent cells\n   - This helps confirm that (17,6) must be safe\n\nBased on this analysis, the safest move is to uncover (15,7) since we've determined it must be safe based on the \"1\" at (16,6) and the existing flag at (15,6).\n\nAnswer: uncover (15,7)","Let's analyze the board to find safe moves or potential mines to flag.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Row 6 (0-indexed):** The cell at (6,6) is a \"?\" with a \"3\" to its left at (6,5).

The \"1\" at (7,7) already has a mine adjacent at (7,8) (from the previous step), so no other adjacent cells can be mines. \n   - The cell at (6,8) is a \"?\" and must be safe. \n   - Action: Uncover (6,8).\n\n3. **Row 8:** The cell at (8,10) is a \"?\" with a \"1\" at (8,9).

At (15,15) is already a mine (flagged as 'F'), which means the '2' at (16,14) only needs one more mine in (16,15)\n4.

Looking at row 15, we see \"1 ? 1\" where the first 1 is at (15,12). This tells us that exactly one of the two cells to its right (at (15,13) and (15,14)) must be a mine.\n\n3. Combining these two observations:\n   - The cell at (14,13) cannot be a mine because if it were, then (14,14) wouldn't be a mine (from row 14's 1), but then in row 15 both (15,13) and (15,14) would have to be mines to satisfy both conditions, which is impossible since the 1 at (15,12) only allows one mine in those two cells.\n   - Therefore, the mine must be at (14,14), and we can flag it.\n\nAnswer: flag (14,14)","Let's analyze the current board state to determine the safest move.\n\nLooking at the revealed numbers, we can make some logical deductions:\n\n1.

In the 7th row (row index 6), there's a '2' at (6,9) which is adjacent to two mines - one is already flagged at (5,8) (the 'F'), so the other must be at (6,10). We should flag (6,10).\n\n3. Looking at the '1' at (7,7), it's adjacent to only one unknown cell at (8,7), which must be a mine.

Another clear pattern is at (8,13) where there's an 'F' (flagged mine) with a '1' at (9,13)\n   - The '1' at (9,13) is already satisfied by the mine at (8,13), so all other adjacent cells must be safe\n   - We can uncover (9,12) and (9,14)\n\n3.

Both must be mines.\n   - However, the number 1 at (6,11) already has a mine at (6,10), so (5,10) cannot be a mine.

Since there's already one mine flagged at (4,1), this doesn't affect this area. The '2' suggests both (3,7) and (4,7) must be mines, but we can't flag both yet.\n\n2. More promising is the area around (7,5) which is a '?'. Looking at (6,6) which is '1', it's adjacent to (7,5) and (7,7). The '1' at (6,6) suggests only one of these two can be a mine. \n\n3. Looking at (8,6) which is '2', it's adjacent to (7,5), (7,6), (7,7), (8,5), (8,7), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).
