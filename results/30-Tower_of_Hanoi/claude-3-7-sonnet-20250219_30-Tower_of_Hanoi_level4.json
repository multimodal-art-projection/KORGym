The objective is to move all the disks to the target column.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e.

Then we need 'c' on top of 'e', then 'b' on top of 'c', and finally 'a' at the top.\n\nLet me make the moves:\n\n1. Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4\n2. Move 'b' from column 1 to column 2 (on top of 'c')\n3. Move 'd' from column 1 to column 4 (on top of 'a')\n4. Move 'b' from column 2 to column 4 (on top of 'd')\n5. Move 'c' from column 2 to column 4 (on top of 'b')\n6. Move 'e' from column 3 to column 4 (on top of 'c')\n\nWait - I made a mistake in my reasoning. The stack grows upward, so smaller disks should be on top. Let me correct my solution:\n\n1. Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4\n2. Move 'b' from column 1 to column 3 (on top of 'e')\n3. Move 'a' from column 4 to column 3 (on top of 'b')\n4. Move 'd' from column 1 to column 4\n5. Move 'a' from column 3 to column 2 (on top of 'c')\n6.

Move 'e' from column 3 to column 4 (on top of 'c')\n\nWait - that's still incorrect. Let me be more careful with the constraints. The bottom of each column contains the largest disk, and the top contains the smallest. So in column 4, 'e' should be at the bottom and 'a' at the top.\n\nLet me solve it properly:\n\n1. Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4\n2. Move 'b' from column 1 to column 4 (on top of 'a')\n3. Move 'd' from column 1 to column 2 (on top of 'c')\n4.

Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4 (on top of 'b')\n11. Move 'e' from column 3 to column 4 (on top of 'a')\n\nNo, that's still not right. Let me think more carefully. The smallest disk is 'a' and the largest is 'e'. In the final state, 'e' should be at the bottom of column 4, then 'd', 'c', 'b', and 'a' at the top.\n\nLet me solve this methodically:\n\n1. Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4\n2. Move 'b' from column 1 to column 4 (on top of 'a')\n3. Move 'd' from column 1 to column 3 (on top of 'e')\n4.

Move 'e' from column 3 to column 4 (on top of 'd')\n8. Move 'a' from column 2 to column 1\n9. Move 'b' from column 2 to column 1 (on top of 'a')\n10.

Move 'a' from column 1 to column 4 (on top of 'b')\n\nHmm, I still think I'm making this too complicated. Let me double check the rule and think once more...\n\nActually, I need to be careful about the representation of the columns. Since 'a' is the smallest disk, it should be at the top of column 1, not at the bottom. Similarly, 'e' is the largest disk and it should be at the bottom of column 3.\n\nLet me redo my solution:\n\nAnswer: [('a', 4), ('b', 4), ('a', 3), ('c', 4), ('a', 2), ('b', 1), ('a', 4), ('d', 4), ('a', 3), ('b', 4), ('a', 4), ('e', 4)]","I need to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem by moving all disks to column 4, which is the target column.\n\nCurrent state:\n- Column 1: a, b, d (with a on top)\n- Column 2: c (only disk c)\n- Column 3: e (only disk e)\n- Column 4: null (empty)\n\nThe goal is to move all disks (a, b, c, d, e) to column 4, following the rules:\n1.
