First, we need to move the smaller disks out of the way to make space for the larger ones.\n   - Move disk 'a' to column 4. This is because 'a' is the smallest disk and we can start by getting it to the target column. So, the first move is ('a', 4).\n   - Then, move disk 'c' to column 1. Since 'c' is on top of 'a' in column 2 and we need to move 'b' later, we move 'c' to column 1. So, the second move is ('c', 1).\n   - Now, move disk 'a' to column 1. We need to move 'b' to column 4, and 'a' is in the way, so we move 'a' on top of 'c' in column 1. So, the third move is ('a', 1).\n   - Next, move disk 'b' to column 4. 'b' is now free to move to the target column. So, the fourth move is ('b', 4).\n2. Now, we deal with the remaining disks in column 1.\n   - Move disk 'a' to column 2. We need to move 'd' to column 4, and 'a' is on top of 'd' in column 1, so we move 'a' to column 2. So, the fifth move is ('a', 2).\n   - Then, move disk 'd' to column 4. 'd' can now be moved to the target column. So, the sixth move is ('d', 4).\n   - Move disk 'a' to column 4. 'a' can be placed on top of 'd' in the target column. So, the seventh move is ('a', 4).\n3. Now, we handle the disks in column 1 and 2.\n   - Move disk 'c' to column 4. 'c' can be moved to the target column. So, the eighth move is ('c', 4).\n   - Move disk 'a' to column 1. We need to move 'e' to column 4, and 'a' is in the way in column 2, so we move 'a' to column 1. So, the ninth move is ('a', 1).\n   - Move disk 'e' to column 4. 'e' is the last large disk and can now be moved to the target column. So, the tenth move is ('e', 4).\n   - Move disk 'a' to column 4. 'a' can be placed on top of 'e' in the target column.

First, understand the problem and the rules:\n   - We need to move all the disks (a, b, c, d, e) to column 4 following the rules of the Tower - of - Hanoi: only move one disk at a time, take the top - most disk from a column, and never place a larger disk on a smaller one.\n2. Analyze the step - by - step moves:\n   - **Step 1: Move disk a to column 4**\n     - The top - most disk on column 2 is a. Since column 4 is empty, we can move a to column 4. So the first move is ('a', 4).\n   - **Step 2: Move disk c to column 1**\n     - After moving a, the top - most disk on column 2 is c. We can move c to column 1 because the top - most disk on column 1 is d which is larger than c. So the second move is ('c', 1).\n   - **Step 3: Move disk a to column 1**\n     - Now, the top - most disk on column 4 is a. We move it to column 1 on top of c. So the third move is ('a', 1).\n   - **Step 4: Move disk b to column 4**\n     - The top - most disk on column 1 is b. We can move it to the empty space on column 4.

So, the sixth move is ('b', 4).\n   - **Move disk a to column 4**: Finally, we move disk a from column 1 to the target column 4. So, the seventh move is ('a', 4).\n   - **Move disk d to column 3**: Disk d is on top of column 1. We move it to column 3. So, the eighth move is ('d', 3).\n   - **Move disk a to column 2**: To make space for disk e, we move disk a to column 2. So, the ninth move is ('a', 2).\n   - **Move disk b to column 1**: We move disk b to column 1. So, the tenth move is ('b', 1).\n   - **Move disk c to column 3**: We move disk c to column 3.

So, the fifteenth move is ('c', 4).\n   - **Move disk a to column 4**: We move disk a to the target column 4. So, the sixteenth move is ('a', 4).\n   - **Move disk b to column 4**: We move disk b to the target column 4.

So, the move is ('a', 4).\n   - Step 2: Move disk 'b' to column 3. Since 'b' is the top - most disk in column 1, and we can place it on 'e' in column 3 as 'b' is larger than 'e'. So, the move is ('b', 3).\n   - Step 3: Move disk 'a' to column 3. Now that 'b' is on top of 'e' in column 3, we can place 'a' on 'b' as 'a' is smaller than 'b'.

'b' is the top - most disk in column 4, and we can place it on 'c' in column 3 as 'b' is smaller than 'c'. So, the move is ('b', 3).\n   - Step 11: Move disk 'a' to column 3. We can take 'a' from column 2 and place it on 'b' in column 3 as 'a' is smaller than 'b'. So, the move is ('a', 3).\n   - Step 12: Move disk 'e' to column 4. 'e' is the top - most (and only) disk in column 3, and we can place it in column 4 on 'd' as 'e' is larger than 'd'. So, the move is ('e', 4).\n   - Step 13: Move disk 'a' to column 4. We can take 'a' from column 3 and place it on 'e' in column 4 as 'a' is smaller than 'e'. So, the move is ('a', 4).\n   - Step 14: Move disk 'b' to column 4.

First, understand the goal:\n   - The goal is to move all the disks (a, b, c, d, e) to column 4 following the rules of the Tower - of - Hanoi problem.\n2. Analyze the steps:\n   - We need to move the smaller disks (a, b, c) to column 4 one by one while keeping the rule that a larger disk is never placed on a smaller one.\n   - Step 1: Move disk a to column 4. Since column 4 currently has the largest disks on top, it is safe to move the smallest disk a there. So the first move is ('a', 4).\n   - Step 2: Move disk b to column 4. After moving a, we can move the next - smallest disk b to column 4. So the second move is ('b', 4).\n   - Step 3: Move disk c to column 4. After moving a and b, we can move disk c to column 4. So the third move is ('c', 4).\n\n3. Compile the list of moves:\n   - The list of moves is [('a', 4), ('b', 4), ('c', 4)].\n\nAnswer: [('a', 4), ('b', 4), ('c', 4)]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: [(\"a\", 2), (\"b\", 4)]'\n\nThe Tower of Hanoi problem consists of four columns and five disks. The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e. Note that column 4 is the target column.\nYour answer should be a list of moves in the format [(disk, target_column), ...], e.g., [('a', 2), ('b', 4)].

The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.
