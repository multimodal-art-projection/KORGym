The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e. Note that column 4 is the target column.\nYour answer should be a list of moves in the format [(disk, target_column), ...], e.g., [('a', 2), ('b', 4)].

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

Consequently, no valid solution sequence exists.\n\nAnswer: []","Below is a valid sequence of moves that will move all disks (a, b, c, d, e) onto column 4 under the given rules, starting from the state 1: c,e, 2: b, 3: a, 4: d.\n\n1) Move c from column 1 to column 4  \n2) Move a from column 3 to column 2  \n3) Move e from column 1 to column 3  \n4) Move c from column 4 to column 3  \n5) Move d from column 4 to column 1  \n6) Move c from column 3 to column 1  \n7) Move e from column 3 to column 4  \n8) Move c from column 1 to column 3  \n9) Move d from column 1 to column 4  \n10) Move c from column 3 to column 4  \n11) Move a from column 2 to column 1  \n12) Move b from column 2 to column 4  \n13) Move a from column 1 to column 4  \n\nAnswer: [('c', 4), ('a', 2), ('e', 3), ('c', 3), ('d', 1), ('c', 1), ('e', 4), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('c', 4), ('a', 1), ('b', 4), ('a', 4)]","","It turns out that from the given configuration, there is no way to free the largest disk (e) and legally move it onto the target column (column 4) underneath all the others. In particular:\n\n• Disk e starts underneath disk c in column 1.  \n• Disk c can only move onto a larger top disk or an empty column.  \n• However, columns 2 and 3 each have smaller top disks (b and a respectively), and column 4 has disk d (also smaller than e) already in place.  \n• Moving c back and forth between column 1 and column 4 eventually blocks disk e anyway, because e cannot go on top of c (that would place a larger disk on a smaller one).  \n• Meanwhile, disk d (in column 4) cannot legally move anywhere else, because every other column is topped by a smaller disk.  \n\nAll attempts to shuffle the smaller disks a, b, c, and d among the columns end up cycling back to a position where e remains trapped under c, and\/or d remains pinned in column 4 with no larger disk or empty column available for it. Consequently, there is no sequence of legal moves that places all five disks onto the target column in the correct order.\n\nAnswer: []","It turns out that from the given configuration, there is no sequence of legal moves that will place all five disks onto column 4. The largest disk (e) cannot be moved onto column 4 unless that column is completely empty (there is no strictly larger disk than e), yet disk d (the next-largest) cannot be moved anywhere except onto e (which is stuck below c on column 1) or back onto column 4. All smaller disks (a, b, c) cannot be rearranged in a way that frees e to go first or frees d to vacate column 4 permanently. Consequently, no complete solution is possible under the standard Tower of Hanoi rules.\n\nAnswer: []","It turns out that from the given configuration, there is no sequence of legal moves that will place all disks (a, b, c, d, e) onto column 4 under the stated rules. The largest disk (e) is blocked below smaller disks, and there is no way to free up a column or rearrange disks so that e can be moved to the target column without violating the “no larger disk on top of a smaller one” rule.

The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e.

Since there is no larger disk than e, column 4 must be empty (or hold only larger disks, which do not exist) before placing e there.  \n• Initially, however, column 4 already contains two smaller disks (a, b). To vacate column 4, we would have to move a and b onto some other pegs. But columns 1 and 2 are empty only at the start, and column 3 has c, d, e (with c on top).  \n• In trying to shuffle the smaller disks (a, b, c) around so that we can free up column 4 for e, we inevitably run into a blocking situation:  \n  – Whenever we move one of the smaller disks onto an empty peg, we end up with no legal way to place the larger disks (d or e) later, because the smaller disks block them (a larger disk cannot legally go on top of a smaller one).  \n  – Conversely, if we try to stack smaller disks on top of bigger ones (which is legal), we quickly run out of moves for the mid-sized disks (c or d) because they, too, cannot go atop anything smaller (a, b), nor can two larger disks (d and e) stay “stuck” under c in column 3 without a place to go.  \n\nRepeated careful attempts show that from this particular partial arrangement, one always becomes stuck. In essence, the configuration “3: c,d,e and 4: a,b” with columns 1 and 2 empty cannot be untangled to place all five disks onto column 4 in the proper order. The state almost certainly arose from at least one illegal move (placing a larger disk atop a smaller one) if one traces it backward from a solvable position.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid sequence of legal Hanoi moves that completes the puzzle from this position.\n\nAnswer: []","It turns out that from the given configuration, there is no way to move all five disks onto column 4 without violating the rule “never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one.” In particular, disks c and d sit above e on column 3, yet there is no bigger disk (or empty peg that can be freed) to move c or d onto.

In a standard solution, the largest disk (e) must end up at the bottom of the target column, with progressively smaller disks stacked above it. Here, however, disks a and b (both smaller than c, d, e) are already in the target column. Because a smaller disk is on top in column 4 (namely “a”), there is no legal way to place c, d, or e onto that same column without first moving a and b elsewhere.

The crux of the problem is that disks “c,” “d,” and “e” (the larger disks) sit in column 3, while “a” and “b” (the smaller disks) already occupy the target column (column 4). Because one may never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk, there is no legal sequence of moves that will free up a place to move “d” or “e” below “a” and “b.” In other words, no matter how you shuffle “a” and “b” among the empty columns (1 and 2), you cannot create a top disk large enough to hold “c” or “d,” and thus you cannot ever move “e” over to column 4.\n\nTherefore, there is no solution.\n\nAnswer: []","Below is one valid sequence of moves (assuming in each column listing, the rightmost disk is actually the top disk).

The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e. Note that column 4 is the target column.\nYour answer should be a list of moves in the format [(disk, target_column), ...], e.g., [('a', 2), ('b', 4)].
