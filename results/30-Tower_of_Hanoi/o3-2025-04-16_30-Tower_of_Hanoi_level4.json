The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e. Note that column 4 is the target column.\nYour answer should be a list of moves in the format [(disk, target_column), ...], e.g., [('a', 2), ('b', 4)].
