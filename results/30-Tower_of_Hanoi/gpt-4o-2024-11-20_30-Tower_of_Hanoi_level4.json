Here are the steps for this problem:\n\n---\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. **Move Disk `a` (from Column 1 to Column 2):**  \n   - This clears Column 1 for temporary moves.\n\n2. **Move Disk `b` (from Column 2 to Column 1):**  \n   - This frees up Column 2 for further operations.\n\n3. **Move Disk `a` (from Column 2 to Column 4):**  \n   - Send the smallest disk to the target column.\n\n4. **Move Disk `b` (from Column 1 to Column 4):**  \n   - Send the second smallest disk to the target column.\n\n5. **Move Disk `c` (from Column 3 to Column 1):**  \n   - This clears Column 3 for further operations.\n\n6. **Move Disk `d` (from Column 4 to Column 3):**  \n   - Temporarily move the second largest disk to Column 3 to make room in Column 4.\n\n7. **Move Disk `e` (from Column 4 to Column 2):**  \n   - Temporarily move the largest disk to Column 2 to make room in Column 4.\n\n8. **Move Disk `d` (from Column 3 to Column 4):**  \n   - Send the second largest disk back to the target column.\n\n9. **Move Disk `e` (from Column 2 to Column 4):**  \n   - Send the largest disk back to the target column.\n\n10. **Move Disk `c` (from Column 1 to Column 4):**  \n    - Send the third largest disk to the target column.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer Format\n\nThe answer is a list of moves we performed.

Columns 3 and 4 already have valid configurations (`d` and `e` are larger disks at the bottom of column 4).\n2. Disks `a` and `b` need to be moved from column 3, and disk `c` needs to be moved from column 2.\n3.

Move `a` (smallest) from column 3 to column 1 (free space temporarily).\n2. Move `b` from column 3 to column 4 (target column, above `d` and `e`).\n3. Move `a` from column 1 to column 4 (place it on top of `b`).\n4. Move `c` from column 2 to column 1 (temporary space, as column 4 already has smaller disks at the top).\n5.

The objective is to move all the disks to the target column. The rules are as follows: each move can only move one disk; you can only take off the top disk from a column; and you can never place a larger disk on top of a smaller one. The disks are labeled as a, b, c, d, e in ascending order of size.\nThe initial state of the Hanoi Tower is similar to: 1: null, 2: a, b, 3: c, d, 4: e. This means column 1 has no disks; column 2 has disks a and b; column 3 has disks c and d; and column 4 has disk e. Note that column 4 is the target column.\nYour answer should be a list of moves in the format [(disk, target_column), ...], e.g., [('a', 2), ('b', 4)].

The current state of columns (1: c,e, 2: b, 3: a, 4: d) requires us to plan moves carefully.\n\nDetails:\n1. Column 4 already has disk d. Smaller disks must be moved to column 4 in the correct order (a → b → c → d → e). \n2. Disk c (on column 1) and disk e (on column 1) must eventually be moved onto column 4.\n3.

Move it to column 3 first, since column 4 has larger disks (`d`, `a`).  \n   Move: ('b', 3)  \n   **State after move**:  \n   Column 1: c, e  \n   Column 2: null  \n   Column 3: b  \n   Column 4: d, a  \n\n3.

Only one disk can be moved at a time.\n2. You can only take the top disk from a column.\n3. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Analysis:\n1. **Current State**:\n   - Column 1: `c, d`\n   - Column 2: `a, e` (where `e` is at the top)\n   - Column 3: `b`\n   - Column 4: `null` (empty target column)\n\n2. **Reasoning**:\n   - The final goal is to move all disks (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`) to column `4`.\n   - Smaller disks need to be moved off the top of columns before the larger ones can be moved underneath them.\n   - Move the disks in the order of their size: `a` (smallest), `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` (largest).\n\n---\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1.

Start by moving the smallest disks first (a and b) to avoid blocking larger disks.  \n2. Leveraging the empty column(s) to temporarily store disks, follow the rules of the Tower of Hanoi.  \n\n#### Moves:\n\n- Step 1: Move disk 'a' (top of column 3) to column 1. → (`a` to column `1`)\n- Step 2: Move disk 'b' (top of column 3) to column 4. → (`b` to column `4`)\n- Step 3: Move disk 'a' (currently in column 1) to column 4. → (`a` to column `4`)\n  \nNow column 3 is empty, column 4 contains disks [a, b], and we can start moving the disks from other columns.  \n\n- Step 4: Move disk 'c' (column 1) to column 3. → (`c` to column `3`)\n- Step 5: Move disk 'd' (column 2) to column 4. → (`d` to column `4`)\n- Step 6: Move disk 'c' (column 3) to column 4. → (`c` to column `4`)\n  \nFinally, column 4 contains all disks in proper order: [a, b, c, d, e].\n\n### Final Answer:\nAnswer: [('a', 1), ('b', 4), ('a', 4), ('c', 3), ('d', 4), ('c', 4)]","The task is to move all the disks to column 4 (the target column) following the Tower of Hanoi rules.

A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.\n\n### Plan:\nThe solution involves moving the disks incrementally from their current positions to column 4 while maintaining the rules:\n\n#### Step-by-step Approach:\n1. **Move disk a** to column 4.\n2. **Move disk b** to column 1 (temporarily).\n3. **Move disk a** to column 1 (on top of b).\n4. **Move disk c** to column 4.\n5. **Move disk a** to column 4.\n6. **Move disk b** to column 4.\n7. **Move disk d** to column 3 (temporarily).\n8. **Move disk c** to column 1 (temporarily).\n9. **Move disk d** to column 4.\n10. **Move disk c** to column 4.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe list of moves, in order, is:\n[('a', 4), ('b', 1), ('a', 1), ('c', 4), ('a', 4), ('b', 4), ('d', 3), ('c', 1), ('d', 4), ('c', 4)]\n\nAnswer: [('a', 4), ('b', 1), ('a', 1), ('c', 4), ('a', 4), ('b', 4), ('d', 3), ('c', 1), ('d', 4), ('c', 4)]","To solve the current problem, we need to move all the disks to column 4 while following the rules of the Tower of Hanoi game.\n\nHere’s the logic I follow:\n1. Move smaller disks onto intermediate columns so that I can move larger disks to the target column.\n2.

You can only move one disk at a time.\n2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty column.\n\nThe current state of columns is:\n- **Column 1**: Empty\n- **Column 2**: e\n- **Column 3**: b, c, d (b is on top)\n- **Column 4**: a (target column)\n\nOur goal is to move all the disks (a, b, c, d, e) to **column 4** in the correct order (a at the top, b below a, c below b, d below c, and e at the bottom).\n\n### Solution\nThis problem can be solved using a sequence of steps that respects the rules of the Tower of Hanoi:\n1. Move smaller disks temporarily to other columns to free up larger disks.\n2. Gradually transport each larger disk to the target column (column 4).\n3. Rebuild the stack in the target column starting from the bottom to the top.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. Move **b** to column 1 (free column).\n2. Move **c** to column 2.\n3. Move **b** to column 2.\n4. Move **d** to column 1.\n5. Move **b** to column 4 (target).\n6. Move **c** to column 4.\n7. Move **b** to column 4.\n8. Move **e** to column 3 (free space).\n9. Move **a** to column 4 (smallest disk in the correct position).\n10. Move **d** to column 4.\n11.

Starting with the current state:\n\nInitial state:\n- Column 1: null\n- Column 2: e\n- Column 3: b, c, d\n- Column 4: a (a is the smallest disk)\n\nSteps:\n1.

Move `'b'` from column 3 to column 1.  \n   **Reason**: `'b'` must be moved to create room to access the larger disks (`c` and `d`) on column 3.  \n   Move: `('b', 1)`\n\n2. Move `'c'` from column 3 to column 2.  \n   **Reason**: Same goal—to free access to larger disk `'d'`.  \n   Move: `('c', 2)`\n\n3. Move `'d'` from column 3 to column 4.  \n   **Reason**: `'d'` should be placed on the target column, where it will eventually remain beneath smaller disks.  \n   Move: `('d', 4)`\n\n4. Move `'c'` from column 2 to column 4.  \n   **Reason**: `'c'` can now go on top of `'d'` on column 4.  \n   Move: `('c', 4)`\n\n5. Move `'b'` from column 1 to column 4.  \n   **Reason**: `'b'` can now be placed on column 4, on top of `'c'`.  \n   Move: `('b', 4)`\n\n6. Move `'e'` from column 2 to column 3.  \n   **Reason**: Disk `'e'` must temporarily move to free up space for the remaining smaller disks to move into column 4.  \n   Move: `('e', 3)`\n\n7. Move `'a'` from column 4 to column 2.  \n   **Reason**: `'a'` (smallest disk) must be moved temporarily to adjust for space in the target column.  \n   Move: `('a', 2)`\n\n8. Move `'e'` from column 3 to column 4.  \n   **Reason**: `'e'` (largest disk) now moves to the target column permanently.  \n   Move: `('e', 4)`\n\n9. Move `'a'` from column 2 to column 4.  \n   **Reason**: `'a'` is the last remaining disk to be moved to the target column.  \n   Move: `('a', 4)`\n\n---\n\nFinal sequence of moves:\n- `[('b', 1), ('c', 2), ('d', 4), ('c', 4), ('b', 4), ('e', 3), ('a', 2), ('e', 4), ('a', 4)]`\n\n---\n\nFinal answer format:\n`Answer: [('b', 1), ('c', 2), ('d', 4), ('c', 4), ('b', 4), ('e', 3), ('a', 2), ('e', 4), ('a', 4)]`","We need to carefully follow the rules of Tower of Hanoi to transfer all disks to the target column (column 4).
