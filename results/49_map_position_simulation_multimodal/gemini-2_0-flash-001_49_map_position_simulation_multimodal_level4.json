For example, if the player is at (3,3), the reverser is at (3,4), and the intended move is UP, the actual movement will be DOWN, landing at (3,2).\n  - Trap (T): Purple,stepping into a trap will trap the player for one turn, making the next move ineffective. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the trap is at (3,4), and the move sequence is UP, UP, LEFT, then the first UP puts the player into the trap, the next UP is canceled, and the player ends up performing LEFT next.\n  - Repeater (R): Yellow,stepping onto a repeater causes the player to move an extra step in the same direction. For example, if the player is at (1,1), and the repeater is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will end up at (1,3).\n\nAdditional Rules:\n  - Map elements can be combined. For example, a jumper may cause the player to land on a trap two cells away.\n  - Elements that have already been triggered during the current turn will not trigger again (except for walls), to prevent infinite loops.\n  - The map boundaries are all walls to prevent going out of bounds.\n  - Map coordinates start from (0,0), i.e., the top-left corner is (0,0).\n\nYou will see a generated sequence of moves.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: (3, 12)'.\n\nYou will be given an n*n map(picture) containing the following elements:\n  - Player (P):Red\n  - Empty cell (E):Whtie\n  - Portal (paired with matching numbers): Blue,Represented by numbers and appear in pairs (1,1; 2,2; etc.). Stepping onto one portal will teleport the player to the other portal with the same number. For example, stepping onto portal 1 will teleport the player to the other portal 1.\n  - Jumper (J): Green,stepping onto a jumper will cause the player to leap two steps in the current direction, skipping the cell in between. For example, if the player is at (1,1) and the jumper is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will land at (1,4), and the element at (1,3) will not be triggered.\n  - Wall (W): Grey,a wall blocks the player's movement, causing them to stay in the original position.\n  - Reverser (A): Orange,the direction of movement will be reversed when passing through a reverser. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the reverser is at (3,4), and the intended move is UP, the actual movement will be DOWN, landing at (3,2).\n  - Trap (T): Purple,stepping into a trap will trap the player for one turn, making the next move ineffective. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the trap is at (3,4), and the move sequence is UP, UP, LEFT, then the first UP puts the player into the trap, the next UP is canceled, and the player ends up performing LEFT next.\n  - Repeater (R): Yellow,stepping onto a repeater causes the player to move an extra step in the same direction. For example, if the player is at (1,1), and the repeater is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will end up at (1,3).\n\nAdditional Rules:\n  - Map elements can be combined. For example, a jumper may cause the player to land on a trap two cells away.\n  - Elements that have already been triggered during the current turn will not trigger again (except for walls), to prevent infinite loops.\n  - The map boundaries are all walls to prevent going out of bounds.\n  - Map coordinates start from (0,0), i.e., the top-left corner is (0,0).\n\nYou will see a generated sequence of moves.

For example, if the player is at (3,3), the reverser is at (3,4), and the intended move is UP, the actual movement will be DOWN, landing at (3,2).\n  - Trap (T): Purple,stepping into a trap will trap the player for one turn, making the next move ineffective. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the trap is at (3,4), and the move sequence is UP, UP, LEFT, then the first UP puts the player into the trap, the next UP is canceled, and the player ends up performing LEFT next.\n  - Repeater (R): Yellow,stepping onto a repeater causes the player to move an extra step in the same direction. For example, if the player is at (1,1), and the repeater is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will end up at (1,3).\n\nAdditional Rules:\n  - Map elements can be combined. For example, a jumper may cause the player to land on a trap two cells away.\n  - Elements that have already been triggered during the current turn will not trigger again (except for walls), to prevent infinite loops.\n  - The map boundaries are all walls to prevent going out of bounds.\n  - Map coordinates start from (0,0), i.e., the top-left corner is (0,0).\n\nYou will see a generated sequence of moves.

The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: (3, 12)'.\n\nYou will be given an n*n map(picture) containing the following elements:\n  - Player (P):Red\n  - Empty cell (E):Whtie\n  - Portal (paired with matching numbers): Blue,Represented by numbers and appear in pairs (1,1; 2,2; etc.). Stepping onto one portal will teleport the player to the other portal with the same number. For example, stepping onto portal 1 will teleport the player to the other portal 1.\n  - Jumper (J): Green,stepping onto a jumper will cause the player to leap two steps in the current direction, skipping the cell in between. For example, if the player is at (1,1) and the jumper is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will land at (1,4), and the element at (1,3) will not be triggered.\n  - Wall (W): Grey,a wall blocks the player's movement, causing them to stay in the original position.\n  - Reverser (A): Orange,the direction of movement will be reversed when passing through a reverser. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the reverser is at (3,4), and the intended move is UP, the actual movement will be DOWN, landing at (3,2).\n  - Trap (T): Purple,stepping into a trap will trap the player for one turn, making the next move ineffective. For example, if the player is at (3,3), the trap is at (3,4), and the move sequence is UP, UP, LEFT, then the first UP puts the player into the trap, the next UP is canceled, and the player ends up performing LEFT next.\n  - Repeater (R): Yellow,stepping onto a repeater causes the player to move an extra step in the same direction. For example, if the player is at (1,1), and the repeater is at (1,2), and the move is UP, the player will end up at (1,3).\n\nAdditional Rules:\n  - Map elements can be combined. For example, a jumper may cause the player to land on a trap two cells away.\n  - Elements that have already been triggered during the current turn will not trigger again (except for walls), to prevent infinite loops.\n  - The map boundaries are all walls to prevent going out of bounds.\n  - Map coordinates start from (0,0), i.e., the top-left corner is (0,0).\n\nYou will see a generated sequence of moves.
