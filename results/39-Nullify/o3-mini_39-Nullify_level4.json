(Also note the special “elimination” rule: if an operation would yield 0 – that is, when the positive and negative parts “cancel” – then the two units are removed from the board.)\n\nLooking over our board:\n  Index 0: 80     (a signed positive number)\n  Index 1: 5     (a signed positive number)\n  Index 2: \/5    (an operator unit dividing by 5)\n  Index 3: -2    (a signed negative number)\n  Index 4: \/-10   (an operator unit dividing by -10)\n  Index 5: -7    (a signed negative number)\n\nEach valid move is to pick one signed number (indices 0,1,3,5) and one operator (indices 2 or 4) and “combine” them.\nFor instance, if we combine the unit at index 0 (80) with the one at index 4 (\/–10), we compute:\n  80 \/ (–10) = –8.\nThis produces a new signed number (–8) that then replaces the two constituent units on the board (unless the result would be 0, in which case both units vanish).\n\nThere is no immediate cancellation (i.e. producing 0) with any other pairing. In planning toward the final goal (eliminate all units to end with 0), one reasonable first step is to perform a valid move that “uses up” an operator unit. One good candidate is to combine index 0 and index 4. (Other moves are possible, but a common first step is to use the large number with the operator that gives an interesting result.)\n\nThus, the operation for the current turn is to combine index 0 and index 4.\n\nAnswer: 0 4","I'll choose to combine unit 0 (which represents +5) with unit 1 (the division operator “\/5”). In our game the example “–7 with ÷3” shows that a sign‐unit combined with an operator unit applies the operator (here dividing 5 by 5) which yields 1. While 1 is not 0, it is a valid move that transforms the board toward our ultimate aim of eliminating all units via subsequent operations. \n\nAnswer: 0 1","By analyzing the board, we note that combining a negative‐number unit with a positive‐number unit has the chance to “cancel” part of the negative value. (Recall that if a positive unit is applied as an addition operation to a negative unit, then the operation is simply “–2 + 1.0” or “–7 + 1.0”, etc.) In our board the four units are:\n\n Index 0: –2  \n Index 1: –7  \n Index 2: –8.0  \n Index 3: 1.0   (which is interpreted as a positive number)\n\nA useful strategy is to “shorten” the total imbalance. In this case, if we combine the unit at index 0 (–2) with the unit at index 3 (which represents +1.0), we perform the operation –2 + 1, which gives –1. This new (nonzero) unit is closer to 0 in magnitude than –2 was. (Recall that if a combination yields exactly 0 then the new unit is eliminated; otherwise, the resulting unit persists.) Such a move makes for a good tactical step toward the ultimate goal of eliminating all units.\n\nThus, for the current turn the best operation is to combine the units with indices 0 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 0 3","We can “cancel” out all numbers if we eventually get a positive and a negative number of equal absolute value. In this board the idea is to produce a positive unit so it cancels the remaining negative unit. To that end, consider combining the −7 (index 0) with −8.0 (index 1). When a “signed” unit is used as the operator, its sign indicates whether you add (if it were a “+”) or subtract (if “−”) the number. So, using −8.0 as an operator means “subtract (−8.0)” which is equivalent to adding 8.0. That is, combining −7 with −8.0 is computed as\n\n  (−7) − (−8.0) = (−7) + 8.0 = 1.0.\n\nNow the board becomes two units: the new positive 1.0 and the remaining −1.0 (index 2). In the next turn combining these (a positive 1.0 with a negative 1.0) will result in 0 and eliminate them both – which meets the game objective.\n\nThus for the current turn, the correct move is to combine unit indices 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","We only have two units on the board – unit 0 (‑1.0) and unit 1 (‑15.0). Since the only possible move is to combine two compatible units, we should combine these two. (When a positive and a negative unit with the same absolute value are combined, they cancel to 0, but here both are negative; still, this combination is the only one available and must be performed in order to eventually reach elimination.) \n\nThus for the current turn, I choose to combine the unit at index 0 with the unit at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This eliminates both units and moves us toward the game’s objective.\n\nAnswer: 2 7","I looked over the board and the allowed moves. In this game only a “number‐unit” that explicitly carries a sign (either “+” or “–”) can be used as the left operand in a move; it may then combine with an “operator‐unit” (such as “÷-3” or “floor”) to produce a new signed number. (Remember for example that combining –10 with “×8” gives –80, and –7 combined with “÷3” gives –2.33…) \n\nOn the board the only unit clearly marked with a sign is the –5 at index 5.

Meanwhile, there are two operator‐units: one is “\/-3” at index 0 and the other is “floor” at index 2. \n\nBetween these choices the division operation looks promising because combining –5 with “\/-3” will compute (–5)\/(–3) = 1.67 (approximately) bringing the absolute value down and potentially helping later to “cancel” a matching positive unit when the overall chain of moves is pieced together to eventually reach zero. \n\nThus my move is to combine the –5 (unit 5) with the “\/-3” (unit 0).\n\nAnswer: 5 0","I’ll use the only available non‐number operation – the floor – by “applying” it to one of the nonzero numbers in hopes of making it smaller (and eventually, if we can get a number below 1, floor will take it to 0 and eliminate it). In this board the only operation unit is at index 1 (floor). Among the numbers, applying floor to 1.6666666666666667 (at index 4) gives 1, which duplicates the number at index 2. (The idea is that by creating duplicate “1”s one may later manipulate them so that one becomes negative; then combining +1 with –1 yields 0 and both vanish.) \n\nSo for this turn I choose to combine the number at index 4 with the operation at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","It looks like we can use one turn to cancel out a pair of small numbers. In many cases the easiest cancellation is to combine a positive and a negative number that have the same absolute value so that their combination is 0 and (by the rules) both vanish. On our board two of the units are “1”. (Often a unit written as “1” is shorthand for “+1”.) If (by a previous conversion or thinking ahead) one of those “1” units is used as a “–1” instead, then combining that –1 with the +1 yields 0 and both are removed.\n\nSo for this move we choose the units at indices 1 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","I examined the board and saw that unit 1 is “10” and unit 2 is “2.” By combining these two (for example, using a division or subtraction‐oriented operation in later moves), we can start transforming these numbers toward a result that will eventually cancel the other units and lead us closer to the final value of 0.

In our game a combinable unit (one written with an explicit + or – sign) “acts” on the other unit according to its operation. In the example in the rules, combining –10 with a multiplication unit “×8” produced –80 (since –10 × 8 = –80). In a similar way, combining –10 with the multiplication unit \"*-6\" uses the operation “multiply by 6” (ignoring the minus sign that appears with the operator for purpose of the operand) so that –10 × 6 gives –60. Although this does not immediately yield 0 and eliminate the units, it produces a new combinable unit (–60) that is closer to being canceled by a positive counterpart later on toward our goal of eliminating all units.\n\nAnswer: 6 4","Here’s my reasoning. In this game the only “combinable” units are those that carry a sign (i.e. “–3”, “2”, “0.0133”, “60”). When a sign‐unit is combined with an operator unit (one of the remaining “non‐signed” units, here “reciprocal” at index 0 and “\/7” at index 1), the arithmetic indicated by the operator is applied to the signed value. (For example, in the sample rules combining “–10” with “×8” produces –80.) Finally, if the operation gives 0 then the two units vanish, which is what we want in the end.\n\nAlthough we don’t have a pair that immediately produces 0 (since none of the positive sign–units and the only negative sign–unit “–3” can match exactly when either divided by 7 or “reciprocaled”), we can make progress by “transforming” one of the sign–units. For instance, if we take the “2” (at index 3) and apply the “\/7” operation (at index 1) then 2 ÷ 7 = 0.2857… While not 0, this move modifies a unit’s value – and by choosing moves in later turns we can hope to eventually obtain a pair of numbers with equal but opposite values (which would cancel to 0).\n\nThus, a perfectly legal move is to combine the “2” (index 3) with “\/7” (index 1). \n\nAnswer: 3 1","I noticed that only one unit carries an explicit sign – unit 1 (“–3”) – so according to the rule that only signed‐number units may be “combined” with an operation‐unit (as in “–10 with ×8” or “–7 with ÷3”), the only available move is to combine the signed unit (–3) with one of the operation‐units. In our board the only operation unit (one that includes an operation name) is unit 0 (“0 reciprocal”). (The other three numbers appear simply as positive values without an explicit “+” and so are not immediately eligible as the unit that drives a combination.) \n\nWhen we combine –3 with the reciprocal operation (i.e. apply “reciprocal” to –3), the usual arithmetic would yield –1\/3. Although –1\/3 ≠ 0 (so no immediate “elimination” occurs), it is a legal move according to the game’s rules for a valid turn. Our aim is to eventually get a pair that sums to 0 (by having a positive and a negative number of equal magnitude) so that no unit is produced – but right now this move is the only one that advances the game. \n\nThus my answer is to combine unit 1 and unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","I looked at the board and “decoded” the units by their type. (Recall that in our game only those units that come with a “+” or “–” sign are considered number‐operands and may be combined with an “operator‐unit”–one that is not prefixed by a sign.) Here the only clearly signed (number) unit is the one at index 3 (–0.3333333333333333). In order to “cancel” some value (i.e. to produce 0 so that the two units disappear), we want to combine it with an operator that (when applied to –0.3333333333333333) yields 0. (For example, the ceiling (“ceil”) operation always returns the least integer that is ≥ its input––and ceil(–0.3333333333333333) gives 0.) Among the remaining units one must represent such an operator. On careful consideration I decided that the unit at index 2 (0.2857142857142857) should be interpreted as “ceil” (its value is not used as a parameter but only to certify its operator‐nature). Thus, by selecting unit 3 as the left operand and unit 2 as the operator (ceil), the combination produces 0 and eliminates both.\n\nSo my move is to combine units 3 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 3 2","I will choose to combine the unit at index 1 (which is +60) with the unit at index 2 (which is –0.047619047619047616). This is because in this game only “signed‐number” units (that is, those with an explicit plus or minus sign) can combine—with one “adding” and the other “subtracting” so that if their “operation” yields an equal but opposite outcome, the new combined unit cancels to zero. Although none of the immediate arithmetic choices (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) of the pairs produces zero on its own, the long‐term goal is to “set up” cancellations so that later the remaining unit can cancel the new one. Here the clear “operator” is the negative unit (index 2) so it is best to use it with one of the positive ones. Out of the two possible positive units the larger value (index 1) is the most promising candidate because when combined with –0.047619047619047616 its recorded operation (for example, subtraction as in “60 – 0.047619047619047616”) is likely to produce a number that can later be canceled by the remaining unit.\n \nThus, for the current turn I choose the combination of indices 1 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","I'll combine the only two available units.

The only available operator unit is \"ceil\" (at index 1) and the only non‐integer number is −27.7447 (at index 3). By applying the ceil operation to −27.7447 we turn it into −27 (since the ceiling of a negative non‐integer is the least integer greater than or equal to it). This makes that unit an integer (and still negative), which can later be paired with a matching positive value. Thus this move moves us closer to the objective of eliminating all units.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","One valid move is to combine the unit at index 1 (which is +10) with the unit at index 2 (which is –6). Interpreting the positive unit as an addition operator, we compute 10 + (–6) = 4. (Although the result isn’t zero yet, this move is legal and will eventually allow further combinations to reach the game’s objective.) \n\nAnswer: 1 2","I recommend combining the two smallest positive units (9 and 3) to gradually build up the sum that will eventually cancel – when added with the other positive numbers (10, 1 and 4) the total becomes 27, which will then cancel with –27.

One way to eventually cancel everything is to first combine the positives into one unit. For instance, if we combine +10 and +1 we get +11. (Later you could combine +11 with +4 to get +15, then with +12 to reach +27, and finally combine +27 with –27 to produce 0 and eliminate both.) \n\nFor this turn, a good move is to combine indices 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","I'll combine unit 0, which is –27 (the only signed number), with unit 2, “12”.

In our board the only two non‐“+”\/“–” words are the two square units (at indices 2 and 5). According to the rules, while units with a sign (e.g. “–10”) have special combination rules (yielding a new number by operating, and if a positive and a negative of equal size are combined the result is 0 and both disappear), the remaining operator units combine with one another in a different way. (The rules state “if two units that do not contain a + or – sign …” and then explain that if their operation would yield 0 no new unit is produced.) In this situation the two “square” units are identical and so—by the intended spirit of cancellation in such cases—the best move is to combine them. This eliminates both operator‐units from the board, moving us qualitatively closer to the objective (eliminating all units to “zero” the board).\n\nThus, for the current turn I choose to operate on the units at indices 2 and 5.\n\nAnswer: 2 5","Based on the idea that our goal is to reach 0 by “cancel‐ing” a positive number with its matching negative counterpart, one useful strategy is to work toward forming a −7 (so it can later cancel a +7 already on the board). Notice that while the only number units that explicitly carry a sign are “–10”, “–6” and “–1.0”, the two board positions showing “7” (at indices 0 and 3) represent positive numbers. Although –6 and –1.0 are both negative, if we “combine” these two signed numbers using the (implicit) addition rule for number–units the result is –6 + (–1.0) = –7. (And when, in a future turn, this –7 is combined with a positive 7, since the two cancel to 0, both will be eliminated.)\n\nFor the current move the best step is thus to combine the two units at indices 7 and 8 (i.e. the –6 and the –1.0) so that on a later turn a +7 can cancel the resulting –7.\n\nAnswer: 7 8","I'll combine the positive 7 at index 0 with the negative 7.0 at index 7.

In our game the valid move is to combine a signed number unit (here “2” at index 3, a positive number) with an operation unit that does not have a sign (here “square” at index 1) so that the number is “squared” (and its sign is preserved). This move is legal per the rules and is a step toward getting balanced units that eventually cancel each other to produce 0.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","We can only combine two units per turn. In this puzzle the “number‐units” (those written with or implying a + or – sign) may cancel if, when “operated on,” they become opposites (equal in absolute value) so that their combination “eliminates” both.

One good tactic is to combine two number‐units that “cook up” an integer easy to work with.\n\nHere the sum 7 + 4 gives 11. Although 11 does not vanish immediately (since –11 is not yet present), it is a simple whole number that we can later cancel (for example by working out –10 combined with an operation that adjusts it to –11, or letting the remaining units combine in later turns). Many of the other candidates (like –10 + 7 or creating an operated value with “square”) would produce less “manageable” numbers at this stage.\n\nThus, the best move is to combine unit 1 (7) with unit 4 (4).\n\nAnswer: 1 4","I'll choose to apply the square operation (unit 1) to the positive number 7.4495 (unit 2). In other words, the move is to combine unit 2 with unit 1. (When a signed number is combined with an operator unit the operator is applied to the absolute value while preserving the original sign; here 7.4495 is positive so “square” produces 7.4495² ≈ 55.5.

The idea is that later you may use operations that “cancel out” a matching positive unit with a matching negative result.

(In our game the sum is invariant unless we use one of the non‐linear operations like square or reciprocal.) Although with only add\/subtract units the complete cancellation is impossible—the overall sum here is 7 + 4 + 6 – 21.58508 ≈ –4.58508—we still must choose a move; the idea is to build up a unit that later might be “corrected” with one of the other allowed operations (for example, a square, sqrt, reciprocal, floor or ceil) in order to eventually get a cancellation.\n\nA natural first step is to combine two of the positive units so that their sum (which is smaller than the sum of all three) may later be used in an operation with the negative unit.

We want to eventually cancel out a positive unit with an equal‐magnitude negative unit so that they vanish (that is, yield 0), which is our goal. One promising approach is to produce a positive 5 from a non‐integer number by “flooring” it. Notice that the board has the number 5.8317 (unit 5) and the floor operator (unit 4). If we combine a number unit with an operator unit, for instance using 5.8317 followed by floor, we get floor(5.8317) = 5. (Recall from the rules that a number unit “with a sign” is meant to be the “operand” and an operator unit (like floor) applies its operation on that operand.) \n\nOnce we have 5 (i.e. a positive number with value 5), it can later cancel with the –5 unit (unit 8) because when a positive and a negative with the same absolute value are combined the result is 0 (thus eliminating both). \n\nSo on this turn it is a good idea to use units 5 and 4. \n\nAnswer: 5 4","I looked at the board and noticed that combining a negative number with its positive counterpart produces 0, which eliminates both units from the board. Here we have −5 at index 6 and 5 (implicitly positive) at index 8. Thus, combining unit 6 with unit 8 gives 0 (since −5 combined with +5 equals 0) and removes them from play.\n\nAnswer: 6 8","We can use the simple idea that applying an operator to zero always gives 0. In our board the objective is to “eliminate” units if the combination produces 0. Notice that multiplying 0 by any number gives 0. (In our game, when two units’ combination gives 0—like when a positive and a negative number of equal size are combined—the produced result is 0 and no new unit appears.) Here we have a unit with value 0 (at index 6) and an operator unit “*4” (at index 0) which, when applied to 0, gives 0. So by combining these two‐units (using the number first then the operator) we get 0. This move will remove both units from the board and is a correct step toward the goal.\n\nAnswer: 6 0","I looked over the board and noticed that the only unit that has an explicit sign is the \"-9\" at index 4. Since signed number units can combine with operation units (see the example “combining -10 with ×8 results in -80”), one useful idea is to let an operation “flip” the sign to eventually cancel things out. In this board, the unit at index 1 is “*-1” (multiplication by –1). When we combine “*-1” with “-9”, we get –9 multiplied by –1 – which results in 9. (Expressed as a signed unit, this becomes +9.) Although further moves will be needed to eventually have a positive and a matching negative unit to cancel to zero, this move is a good start toward the objective of eliminating all units.\n\nThus, for the current turn the two units to combine are at indices 1 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","We can use the square operator with the number 0. Squaring 0 results in 0, and according to the rules if the operation yields 0 then no new unit is produced, which effectively eliminates both units.

In our examples – like “combining –10 with ×8” or “combining –7 with ÷3” – the rule is that the left unit’s (signed) number “operates” with the right operator unit, and when a positive and a negative with equal magnitude are combined the result is 0 (and both vanish).\n\nAlthough the board does not show explicit + or – before the non‐operator numbers, by convention we treat ordinary numbers as positive (that is, as though they carried a “+” sign). Meanwhile the “reciprocal” unit (index 0) is a “function‐unit” that can be applied only when paired with a signed number as its left operand. (Notice, for example, the way one “applies” the multiplication or division operator in the examples.)\n\nSince our goal is to “eliminate all units” eventually, it is best to use moves that combine two number‐units so that with careful later operations a cancellation (i.e. a +x and a –x) can be arranged.

This move applies a multiplication operator to a signed number, which is a valid move toward eventually canceling out all unit values.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","One valid move is to combine a numeral unit with an operator unit. For example, we can take unit 5, which is “–6”, and combine it with unit 1, which is “*9”. In doing so the –6 is multiplied by 9 yielding –54 (just as the sample “–10 * 8 = –80” in the rules). Although –54 is not 0 immediately, it is a perfectly legal step toward eventually eliminating all units, since combining a numeral unit (with its sign) with an arithmetic operator is allowed.\n\nAnswer: 5 1","I'll start by noting that a seemingly promising first move is to “rationalize” one of the non‐integer numbers. In our board the first unit is 21.9259. By combining it with a unit that “rounds” it—the floor operator—we get an integer value. In this game the convention is that when you combine a signed number with an operator unit the operator is applied to the number (just as –10 combined with a “×8” would yield –10×8 = –80). In our case, applying the floor operation to 21.9259 yields 21. (Recall that floor(21.9259) = 21.) This may later help in pairing up numbers with opposite sign so that when you combine a positive unit with a negative unit that’s its exact opposite, the result is 0 and both disappear.\n\nThus for the current turn a good move is to combine the unit at index 0 (21.9259) with the unit at index 3 (floor).\n\nAnswer: 0 3","I'll choose to combine the negative sign‐number unit with the smallest absolute value––in this case, –9 at index 2––with the square operator at index 1. When the game combines a sign‐number unit with an operator unit, the operator applies to the absolute value while retaining the original “sign” (as in the given examples). In our case, “–9 square” would produce –(9²) = –81. Although more moves are needed to get all the units to cancel out, this turn is a valid and promising step toward the final goal of 0.\n\nAnswer: 2 1","I’ll combine the unit at index 1 (which is +25) with the unit at index 2 (which is –35). Interpreting the rule that when a positive number “combines” with a negative number the operation is taken from the sign of the second unit (i.e. subtraction), the operation we perform is 25 – 35, which produces –10. (Note that although –10 is not 0, our aim is to eventually work toward total elimination in a series of moves.) \n\nAnswer: 1 2","I'll select units 3 and 1. That is, I'll combine the unit at index 3 (which is 81, treated as +81) with the unit at index 1 (which is –54). This gives 81 + (–54) = 27. Although 27 isn’t 0, it’s a step toward reducing and eventually canceling all units. In future moves the newly created unit (27) can be combined with another unit to progress toward the objective.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","We can plan a series of moves toward a final cancellation. One possible winning chain is as follows:\n\n• First, combine the +4 unit (index 0) with the –10 unit (index 2). When a positive unit is used first, we add its value to the second unit. That is, 4 + (–10) gives –6. (Note that –6 is now a negative unit.)\n\nAfter this move the board becomes: –6, +21, +27.\n\n• On a later turn we could combine –6 (as first operand) with +21. Since –6 used first means its value is subtracted by the next unit, we have –6 – 21 = –27.\n\nThen the board is: –27, +27.\n\n• Finally, combining +27 with –27 (selecting +27 as the first operand) gives 27 + (–27) = 0. Since the result is 0, both units are eliminated and the board is cleared—achieving the game objective.\n\nFor the current turn our move is to start that winning sequence by combining the +4 and the –10 units. Thus, we output the two indices: 0 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","I'll choose a move that sets up a cancellation. Notice that combining the -6 unit (index 2) with the +21 unit (index 0) in that order uses the negative unit’s subtraction. That is, treating –6 as “–6” (subtraction), we perform –6 – 21, which equals –27. Then, in a future move, the +27 unit (index 1) can cancel with –27 (because +27 – 27 = 0). Therefore, for the current turn select the operation that combines unit 2 with unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Based on the given board there are only two units available – one at index 0 with the value 27 and one at index 1 with the value 15. In this puzzle each move consists of selecting two units to operate on, and if (and only if) the resulting value is exactly 0 the two units cancel out (are eliminated). For example, when a positive number and a negative number of equal magnitude combine, the outcome is 0 and both are removed. Here, choosing 0 and 1 is the only available move even though 27 and 15 (if considered as +27 and +15) will not cancel each other. (In some puzzles a move must be made even if the cancellation isn’t achieved immediately.) \n\nThus, following the game rules and given that all units must eventually be eliminated from the board, the only allowed move is to combine the two available units. \n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

In our case, combining the unit with +3 (index 2) with the unit -3 (index 4) will result in 0. When a combination yields 0, no new unit remains, which is exactly what we desire to help achieve the final objective of eliminating all units.\n\nThus, the move I choose is to combine the units at indices 2 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 2 4","I'll choose to combine the 0 with the multiplication unit *-8.

That is:\n Unit 1: 0  Unit 2: 2\n Unit 3: 1  Unit 4: 0\n\nSince the only way to completely eliminate (cancel) two units is to combine a number with its additive inverse – and zero is its own inverse (0 – 0 = 0, leaving no new unit) – the best move is to combine the two 0 units (at indices 1 and 4). This combination immediately gives 0 and thus eliminates both units from the board.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","Based on the rules, the only way to eliminate units is to combine a number‐unit having a positive sign with one of the same absolute value bearing a negative sign so that their operation produces 0 (and hence “removes” both from the board). Looking at the board\n\n  0 2\n  1 0\n\nwe interpret the two “0” entries (which are in positions 1 and 4 when read in order from left‐to‐right, top‐to‐bottom) as the two units that cancel each other. By combining them we “eliminate” both (since 0 paired with 0 effectively gives 0 in the spirit of “equal but opposite”). \n\nThus, for this turn the correct move is to combine the unit in position 1 with the unit in position 4.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","Based on the rules, a valid action is one that “makes a combination” whose numerical result is 0 so that those two units disappear. In our examples the only instance given was that a unit with a positive number and one with the same number but with a negative sign (for example, +x and –x) cancel each other out (since +x – x = 0). Looking at the board\n\n  0 2\n  1 0\n\nwe interpret each cell as a unit (with the usual implicit “+” for non‐negative values). Thus cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 have values +0, +2, +1, and +0 respectively. (The board is read in row‐major order: index 1 is “0” at the top‐left, index 2 is “2”, index 3 is “1” and index 4 is “0”.)\n\nIn order to achieve a combination that produces 0 immediately, the best choice is to pair the two 0’s. Although by the rule’s example it is usually a positive value combined with its negative counterpart, note that 0 (whether considered “+0” or “–0”) is its own opposite so that 0 – 0 = 0. This means if we combine unit 1 (which holds 0) with unit 4 (which also holds 0) the result is 0 and both units will be eliminated from the board.\n\nThus the best move is to combine the units at indices 1 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","I'll start by explaining my reasoning. One way to interpret the board is to take each number as the “code” for a unit type.

A valid move is to choose one number unit (which will serve as the left operand) and one operator unit (for the operation on that number).\n\nOur goal is to eventually eliminate all units—that is, if the result of an operation equals 0, then no new unit is produced (the original two vanish). Notice that if we take a number 0 and combine it (using any operator that “operates” on it) the result will be 0.\n\nThus a straightforward valid move is to combine the number unit from index 0 (which is “+0”) with the operator unit from index 1 (“×2”):\n  Operation: 0 × 2 = 0.\nSince the result is 0, both units are eliminated, matching the objective.\n\nAccording to the move format (by outputting the two unit indices separated by a space), one acceptable answer is:\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This is a valid move according to the game rules, even though it does not immediately eliminate a unit by producing 0.

This creates a new sign unit (–63) that can later be paired with its positive counterpart if we produce +63, moving us toward the goal to cancel units.

Of the two operator units available, the multiplication unit “*7” at index 2 is the only one that can be combined with a signed number without needing to worry about getting a non‐real result (for example, “sqrt” would require its argument to be nonnegative). By choosing to combine –16 (index 3) with “*7” (index 2) we obtain –16×7 = –112.

Notice that among the board’s four units, the two units in the top row (the two zeros) represent operator‐units. In our available operator types only floor and ceil are provided—and for turning our negative number into a number equal in absolute value to the positive “1” (so that they cancel when later combined) we can use the ceil operation. In fact, applying ceil to –1.0816999999999997 (unit index 4) will yield –1. (Recall that for negative numbers the ceiling rounds “up”—so ceil(–1.0817) = –1.) Once that is in hand, the “+1” from unit index 3 and “–1” will cancel (since +1 combined with –1 gives 0, eliminating both).\n\nThus for the current turn I will choose to combine the operand unit –1.0816999999999997 (index 4) with the operator unit that provides the ceil operation. Assuming standard left‐to‐right ordering for the operator units, the first row “0 0” gives index 1 for floor and index 2 for ceil. So the appropriate move is to combine unit 4 with unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 4 2","I inspected the board and noticed that two of the available units are 0. Since combining a pair of numbers whose operation yields 0 eliminates them from the board, the two zeros can be paired together so that no new unit is created. In the board, the first two units are 0 and 0. Therefore, for the current turn the best move is to combine units 1 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","From the board there are four units.

In the current board the two zeros (indices 1 and 2) already sum to 0. Therefore, selecting and combining them in the current turn will eliminate both units immediately. \n\nAnswer: 1 2","We can notice that if we combine two numeric units and the combination gives 0 then both leave the board. Here the board shows four units. Interpreting the board as listing four units in order (using 1‐based indexing):\n\n Unit 1: 0  \n Unit 2: 0  \n Unit 3: 1  \n Unit 4: –1.0816999999999997\n\nA sure way to eliminate some units immediately is to combine the two zeros. Interpreting a “0” as an implicit “+0” (a number unit that can combine), if you combine 0 with 0 you get 0 – and when the result is 0 the rule tells us no new unit is produced (that is, both units vanish).\n\nThus the best current move is to combine Unit 1 and Unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","I'll combine the two zeros. Using their indices (we number the board units row‐major starting at 1: so the first row gives units 1 and 2, and the second row gives units 3 and 4), combining units 1 and 2 (both zero) will result in 0. Because when the combination gives 0 no new unit is produced, those two are eliminated, moving us toward the final objective.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","We want to cancel out all units so that nothing remains (that is, the overall result is 0). Notice that one unit is 0 and the other is –1.0816999999999997. In our game, when you combine a number unit with an operator unit the operation is applied to the number; for example, “–10” combined with “×8” gives –10×8 = –80. In our case we can “use” the fact that 0 multiplied by any non‐zero number gives 0. In other words, if we treat unit 1 (which shows –1.0816999999999997) as a “×–1.0816999999999997” white–it acts as a multiplication operator–and combine it with unit 0, then 0×(–1.0816999999999997)=0. Since the rule says that when an operation produces 0 no new unit is produced, combining these two will eliminate both.\n\nThus, the move is to combine unit 0 with unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format. The last line of your response should be in the following format: 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER' (without quotes), where YOUR_ANSWER is your final answer to the question,e.g.'Answer: LEFT'\n\nIn the game, there are several independent units. Among them, units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. For example, combining -10 with ×8 results in -80, and combining -7 with ÷3 yields -2.33... If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced; if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…  \nGame Objective: Eliminate all units, meaning that the final combined result is 0.  \n\nCurrent Unit Types:\n+number: A positive number, which also represents the addition operation.  \n-number: A negative number, which also represents the subtraction operation.  \n*number: Multiplication operation.  \n\/number: Division operation.  \nsqrt: Square root operation.  \nsquare: Square operation.  \nreciprocal: Reciprocal operation.  \nfloor: Floor (round down) operation.  \nceil: Ceiling (round up) operation.  \n\nPlease output the operation for the current turn by directly providing the two corresponding unit indices, separated by a space (e.g., \"Answer: 2 4\").  \n\nboard:  \n0 0\n1 -1.0816999999999997\n\n","epoch":13,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
