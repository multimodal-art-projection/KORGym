Let's choose to combine unit 0 (-10) with unit 2 (\/1).\n\nStep 1: Combine 0 (-10) and 2 (\/1).\n- Operation: -10 \/ 1 = -10.\n- Units 0 and 2 are removed. A new unit -10 is added.\n- The board becomes: +4, +8, -2, -10 (indices will likely re-adjust).\n- The sum is still +4 + 8 - 2 - 10 = 0.\n\nStep 2: Now combine the remaining number units.\n- Combine +4 and +8 -> +12. Board: [-2, -10, +12].\n- Combine -2 and -10 -> -12. Board: [+12, -12].\n- Combine +12 and -12 -> 0. All units eliminated.\n\nThis sequence works. The first operation was combining units 0 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\n**Board:**\n0: +4\n1: +8\n2: -2\n3: -10.0\n\n**Rules:**\n- Units with signs (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n- Combining two signed number units likely means adding their values. Let's assume combining unit A (value `a`) and unit B (value `b`) results in a new unit with value `a + b`.\n- If the combination results in 0, no new unit is produced (both units are eliminated).\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with a combined result of 0.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe current values are +4, +8, -2, and -10.\nThe sum of these values is 4 + 8 - 2 - 10 = 12 - 12 = 0.\nSince the total sum is 0, it is possible to eliminate all units by pairing them up appropriately.\n\nWe need to choose two units to combine in this turn. Let's explore possible combinations:\n1.  Combine 0 (+4) and 1 (+8): Result = 4 + 8 = +12. Board becomes: -2, -10, +12.\n2.  Combine 0 (+4) and 2 (-2): Result = 4 + (-2) = +2. Board becomes: +8, -10, +2.\n3.  Combine 0 (+4) and 3 (-10): Result = 4 + (-10) = -6. Board becomes: +8, -2, -6.\n4.  Combine 1 (+8) and 2 (-2): Result = 8 + (-2) = +6. Board becomes: +4, -10, +6.\n5.  Combine 1 (+8) and 3 (-10): Result = 8 + (-10) = -2. Board becomes: +4, -2, -2.\n6.  Combine 2 (-2) and 3 (-10): Result = -2 + (-10) = -12. Board becomes: +4, +8, -12.\n\nAny of these combinations is a valid first step towards the goal of reaching 0. For example, if we choose combination 1 (0 and 1):\n- Combine 0 (+4) and 1 (+8) -> +12. Remaining: 2 (-2), 3 (-10), New (+12).\n- Combine 2 (-2) and 3 (-10) -> -12. Remaining: New (+12), New (-12).\n- Combine New (+12) and New (-12) -> 0. All units eliminated.\n\nAlternatively, if we choose combination 2 (0 and 2):\n- Combine 0 (+4) and 2 (-2) -> +2. Remaining: 1 (+8), 3 (-10), New (+2).\n- Combine 1 (+8) and 3 (-10) -> -2. Remaining: New (+2), New (-2).\n- Combine New (+2) and New (-2) -> 0. All units eliminated.\n\nSince any pair combination works as a first step, I will choose the first pair, indices 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nBoard:\n0: -2\n1: -10.0\n2: 12\n\nUnits with signs (+ or -) can act as values and also represent addition (+) or subtraction (-) operations. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0, eliminating all units.\n\nLet's explore the possible combinations for the first move:\n\n1.  Combine 0 (-2) and 1 (-10.0):\n    *   Treating 0 as the value and 1 as the operation (-): -2 - 10.0 = -12\n    *   Treating 1 as the value and 0 as the operation (-): -10.0 - 2 = -12\n    The result is -12. The board becomes [12, -12].\n\n2.  Combine 0 (-2) and 2 (12):\n    *   Treating 0 as the value and 2 as the operation (+): -2 + 12 = 10\n    *   Treating 2 as the value and 0 as the operation (-): 12 - 2 = 10\n    The result is 10. The board becomes [-10.0, 10].\n\n3.  Combine 1 (-10.0) and 2 (12):\n    *   Treating 1 as the value and 2 as the operation (+): -10.0 + 12 = 2\n    *   Treating 2 as the value and 1 as the operation (-): 12 - 10.0 = 2\n    The result is 2. The board becomes [-2, 2].\n\nIn all three cases, the next step involves combining two numbers that are equal in absolute value but opposite in sign (e.g., 12 and -12, -10.0 and 10, -2 and 2). According to the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\", combining these pairs will result in 0 and eliminate all units.\n\nTherefore, any of the initial combinations is a valid first step towards the goal. I will choose to combine units 1 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Answer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This seems like the most strategic move.\n\nI choose to combine unit 2 and unit 5.\n\nAnswer: 2 5","Based on the board and rules:\nUnits:\n0: \/4\n1: 5 (Assumed +5)\n2: 4 (Assumed +4)\n3: \/10\n4: -99.9999\n\nRules suggest signed numbers (+\/- number) combine with operators (\/number). Unsigned numbers are likely implicit positives. The goal is to combine units to reach a final result of 0, eliminating all units. Combinations resulting in 0 remove both units.\n\nLet's analyze potential first moves:\n1.  Combine signed number with operator:\n    *   Combine 4 (-99.9999) with 0 (\/4): Result ≈ -25\n    *   Combine 4 (-99.9999) with 3 (\/10): Result ≈ -10\n2.

However, among the possible first moves, combining unit 2 (+4) with unit 0 (\/4) yields exactly +1. This simplifies the board state considerably by introducing an integer.\n\nLet's choose the move combining index 2 and index 0.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nThe current units are:\nIndex 0: +5\nIndex 1: \/10 (Operation: Divide by 10)\nIndex 2: -99.9999\nIndex 3: +1.0\n\nThe objective is to combine units until all are eliminated, which happens when the final result is 0. Elimination occurs when a pair of units +X and -X are combined. Combining a number unit (+\/- number) with an operation unit applies the operation to the number.\n\nLet's explore possible first moves:\n\n1.  Combine two number units:\n    *   Combine 0 (+5) and 3 (+1.0): 5 + 1.0 = +6.0. Remaining units: +6.0, \/10, -99.9999.\n    *   Combine 0 (+5) and 2 (-99.9999): 5 + (-99.9999) = -94.9999. Remaining units: -94.9999, \/10, +1.0.\n    *   Combine 2 (-99.9999) and 3 (+1.0): -99.9999 + 1.0 = -98.9999. Remaining units: +5, \/10, -98.9999.\n\n2.  Combine a number unit with the operation unit (\/10):\n    *   Combine 0 (+5) and 1 (\/10): 5 \/ 10 = +0.5. Remaining units: +0.5, -99.9999, +1.0.\n    *   Combine 2 (-99.9999) and 1 (\/10): -99.9999 \/ 10 = -9.99999. Remaining units: +5, -9.99999, +1.0.\n    *   Combine 3 (+1.0) and 1 (\/10): 1.0 \/ 10 = +0.1. Remaining units: +5, -99.9999, +0.1.\n\nNone of these first moves immediately lead to an obvious cancellation or a clear path to zero with standard arithmetic. For example, if we choose move 2 1:\nBoard becomes: +5, -9.99999, +1.0\nCombining +5 and +1.0 gives +6.0. Board: +6.0, -9.99999\nCombining these gives -3.99999.

Not zero.\n\nHowever, I need to provide *an* operation for the current turn. Combining the two positive numbers simplifies the board somewhat.

The sign is preserved. Example: -N combines with \/M to give -(N\/M).\n- If two signed number units combine (+N and -M), they are added (N + (-M) = N - M).\n- If a combination results in 0 (like +N and -N), both units are removed, and no new unit is created.\n- The objective is to eliminate all units, ending with a result of 0. This typically happens via the cancellation rule (+X and -X).\n\nPossible First Moves:\n\n1.  **Combine Unit 1 (-99.9999) and Unit 0 (\/10):**\n    - Operation: Apply \/10 to -99.9999.\n    - Result: -99.9999 \/ 10 = -9.99999\n    - Remaining Units: A new unit `-9.99999` and the existing unit `2: 6.0`.\n    - Indices: 1 0\n\n2.  **Combine Unit 2 (6.0) and Unit 0 (\/10):**\n    - Operation: Apply \/10 to +6.0.\n    - Result: 6.0 \/ 10 = 0.6\n    - Remaining Units: A new unit `+0.6` and the existing unit `1: -99.9999`.\n    - Indices: 2 0\n\n3.  **Combine Unit 1 (-99.9999) and Unit 2 (6.0):**\n    - Operation: Add the two signed numbers.\n    - Result: -99.9999 + 6.0 = -93.9999\n    - Remaining Units: A new unit `-93.9999` and the existing unit `0: \/10`.\n    - Indices: 1 2\n\nGoal Analysis:\nWe need to reach a state where units cancel out to 0. Let's see where each path leads:\n- Path 1 leads to `[-9.99999, +6.0]`. Combining these gives -3.99999. Not 0.\n- Path 2 leads to `[-99.9999, +0.6]`. Combining these gives -99.3999. Not 0.\n- Path 3 leads to `[\/10, -93.9999]`. Combining these (applying \/10 to -93.9999) gives -9.39999. Not 0.\n\nNone of the immediate combinations seem to lead directly to a state where cancellation to 0 is possible, even considering potential rounding of -99.9999 to -100.\n\nSince no path is obviously superior for reaching the objective based on the current state and rules, I will select a valid move.

So, combining `X` with `\/-10` results in `X \/ -10`.\n*   Combining two number units (`±A`, `±B`) results in their sum (`±A + ±B`).\n*   Combining `+A` and `-A` results in 0 and eliminates both units.\n*   The goal is to reach a state where the final result is 0.\n\n**Analysis of First Move Options:**\n\n1.  **Combine a number with the operator `\/-10` (index 2):**\n    *   Combine `0 (+80)` and `2 (\/-10)`: `80 \/ -10 = -8`.

They \"can combine with other units\".\n- Unit 2 (1.0) doesn't have an explicit sign. Assuming it's treated as a positive number (+1.0), it represents the number 1.0 and the addition operation (+1.0). It should also be able to combine.\n\n**Combination Rule:**\nThe examples (combining -10 with ×8 results in -80) suggest a number unit combined with an operation unit results in the operation applied to the number.\nWhen combining two number units (+\/- number), the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\" strongly suggests the operation is addition. Let's test this interpretation: Combining unit A (+a or -a) and unit B (+b or -b) results in a new unit C = a + b. If C = 0, both A and B are removed, and no new unit is added. Otherwise, A and B are removed, and C is added to the board.\n\n**Objective:**\nEliminate all units, meaning the final combined result is 0. This implies the game ends either when the board is empty (because all units cancelled out to 0) or possibly when the only remaining unit has a value of 0.\n\n**Current State Analysis:**\nThe current units are -2, -7, 1.0, -8.0.\nThe sum of all units is -2 + (-7) + 1.0 + (-8.0) = -16.0.\nSince the total sum is not 0, it's impossible to eliminate all units *purely* by finding pairs that sum to 0 right now or by summing everything up. However, we need to make a move for the current turn.\n\n**Possible Moves (Combinations):**\nLet's see the results of combining pairs (assuming addition):\n1.  Combine 0 (-2) and 1 (-7): Result = -2 + (-7) = -9. Board becomes: -9, 1.0, -8.0.\n2.  Combine 0 (-2) and 2 (1.0): Result = -2 + 1.0 = -1.0. Board becomes: -1.0, -7, -8.0.\n3.  Combine 0 (-2) and 3 (-8.0): Result = -2 + (-8.0) = -10.0. Board becomes: -10.0, -7, 1.0.\n4.  Combine 1 (-7) and 2 (1.0): Result = -7 + 1.0 = -6.0. Board becomes: -6.0, -2, -8.0.\n5.  Combine 1 (-7) and 3 (-8.0): Result = -7 + (-8.0) = -15.0. Board becomes: -15.0, -2, 1.0.\n6.  Combine 2 (1.0) and 3 (-8.0): Result = 1.0 + (-8.0) = -7.0. Board becomes: -7.0, -2, -7.\n\n**Choosing a Move:**\nNone of the initial combinations result in 0. We need to choose one pair to combine. Move 6 (combining 2 and 3) results in -7.0. The new board state would be (-2, -7, -7.0). This creates two units with the value -7 (one integer, one float). This might be strategically interesting, although it doesn't immediately lead to the goal. Since no move offers a clear path to 0 in one step, combining 2 and 3 seems like a reasonable choice.\n\n**Output:**\nThe required output is the indices of the two units to combine, separated by a space. I choose to combine unit 2 and unit 3.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","Based on the board and rules:\n1.  **Current Board:**\n    *   0: -2\n    *   1: -7\n    *   2: -7.0\n2.  **Objective:** Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n3.  **Relevant Rules:**\n    *   '-number' units represent both a negative number and the subtraction operation.\n    *   Units combine.\n    *   Elimination (no new unit produced) occurs when a combination results in 0. The primary example given is combining a positive and negative number with equal absolute values (+X and -X).\n4.  **Analysis:**\n    *   The board currently contains only negative numbers. The standard elimination rule (+X and -X) cannot be directly applied.\n    *   We need to explore how combining two '-number' units works. Let's assume combining unit `i` and unit `j` means applying the operation of unit `i` to the number of unit `j`, or vice-versa. The rule states '-number' represents subtraction.\n    *   Consider combining 1 (-7) and 2 (-7.0).\n        *   If combine `1 2` means `value(2) - value(1)`: -7.0 - (-7) = -7.0 + 7 = 0.\n        *   If combine `2 1` means `value(1) - value(2)`: -7 - (-7.0) = -7 + 7.0 = 0.\n    *   In either case (1 2 or 2 1), the combination of -7 and -7.0 results in 0.\n    *   According to the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0..., no new unit is produced\", combining units 1 and 2 should eliminate them from the board.\n    *   This move simplifies the board by removing two units, even if it doesn't immediately achieve the final objective (it would leave unit 0: -2). It seems like the most effective move given the current state, as units 1 and 2 are numerically equal, leading to a zero result through subtraction.\n\n5.  **Chosen Move:** Combine units 1 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Based on the board and rules provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The board contains two units:\n    *   Unit 0: -2\n    *   Unit 1: -14.0 (which is equivalent to -14)\n    Both units are of the type \"-number\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the rules:**\n    *   Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n    *   The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n    *   Elimination occurs when a combination results in 0, specifically mentioning the case of combining a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values (e.g., +X and -X). This suggests an additive combination mechanism.\n\n3.  **Determine the move:**\n    *   There are only two units on the board: -2 and -14.\n    *   According to the rules, these units can combine.\n    *   The most plausible combination method, given the cancellation rule, is addition: (-2) + (-14) = -16.\n    *   While this move (-16) doesn't immediately reach the goal of 0, it is the only possible combination available on the current board. The task is to provide the operation for the *current turn*.\n    *   Combining unit 0 and unit 1 is the action.

Combine 2 (39.5822) and 0 (ceil): `ceil(39.5822) = 40`. Board: `[40, sqrt, 4, \/-1]`\n2.  Combine 2 (39.5822) and 1 (sqrt): `sqrt(39.5822) ≈ 6.2914`. Board: `[ceil, 6.2914, 4, \/-1]`\n3.

It's often useful to simplify the board by creating integers or getting closer to potential cancellations (like having X and -X). Moves 1, 5, and 6 create integers (40, 2, -4 respectively). Move 5 (combining 3 and 1) creates the smallest integer (2), which might be easier to work with. Let's choose this move.\n\n**Selected Move:**\nCombine unit 3 (`4`) and unit 1 (`sqrt`). The result is `sqrt(4) = 2`.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nThe board has four units:\n- Unit 0: `ceil` (Ceiling operation)\n- Unit 1: `39.5822` (This is a positive number, effectively +39.5822)\n- Unit 2: `\/-1` (Division by -1 operation)\n- Unit 3: `2.0` (This is a positive number, effectively +2.0)\n\nThe goal is to combine units until all are eliminated, which happens when a combination results in 0. The rules state this occurs when a positive number and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on (combined).\n\nWe need to combine a number unit (+39.5822 or +2.0) with an operation unit (`ceil` or `\/-1`). The combination replaces the two units with the result.\n\nLet's explore the possible first moves:\n\n1.  Combine Unit 1 (+39.5822) and Unit 0 (`ceil`):\n    Result: `ceil(39.5822)` = +40.\n    Remaining Board: `+40`, `\/-1`, `+2.0`\n\n2.

We can combine `+2.0` and `\/-1` to get -2. Board becomes `+40`, `-2`. Cannot cancel to 0.\n- Path starting with (1, 2) -> Board: `ceil`, `+2.0`, `-39.5822`. We can combine `+2.0` and `ceil` to get +2. Board becomes `+2`, `-39.5822`. Cannot cancel to 0.\n- Path starting with (3, 0) -> Board: `+39.5822`, `\/-1`, `+2`. We need -2 to cancel the +2. We can combine `+2` and `\/-1` to get -2. Board becomes `+39.5822`, `-2`. Cannot cancel to 0. (The +2 is consumed to make -2).\n- Path starting with (3, 2) -> Board: `ceil`, `+39.5822`, `-2`. We need +2 to cancel the -2. We can combine `+39.5822` and `ceil` to get +40. Board becomes `+40`, `-2`. Cannot cancel to 0. (The original +2.0 needed to make +2 with `ceil` was consumed in the first step).\n\nIt appears that making the required pair (+2, -2) is impossible because both operations needed (`ceil` and `\/-1`) must be applied to the same starting unit (+2.0), which gets consumed after the first operation.\n\nHowever, the task is to output the operation for the *current turn*. Both moves involving Unit 3 (+2.0) seem aimed at creating the potentially cancelling pair (+2, -2). Let's choose one of them. Combining 3 and 2 creates -2.\n\nAnswer: 3 2","Okay, I will analyze the board and rules to determine the next move.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n- Unit 0: `ceil` (Ceiling operation)\n- Unit 1: `39.5822` (A number)\n- Unit 2: `-2.0` (A negative number, also represents subtraction operation according to the rules)\n\n**Rules Recap:**\n- Signed numbers (+\/- number) can combine with other units.\n- Examples show signed numbers combining with operation units (*, \/) by applying the operation (e.g., -10 with *8 -> -80).\n- Units can be eliminated if their combination results in 0 (e.g., +X and -X combine to 0, likely via addition).\n- Operations like `ceil` are units that can combine.\n\n**Possible Combinations:**\n\n1.  **Combine Unit 0 (`ceil`) and Unit 1 (`39.5822`):** Apply the `ceil` operation to the number `39.5822`.\n    `ceil(39.5822)` = `40.0`.\n    The remaining units would be `40.0` and `-2.0`. This seems like a valid move, applying an operation to a number.\n\n2.  **Combine Unit 0 (`ceil`) and Unit 2 (`-2.0`):** Apply the `ceil` operation to the number `-2.0`.\n    `ceil(-2.0)` = `-2.0`.\n    The remaining units would be `39.5822` and `-2.0`. This is also a valid move.\n\n3.  **Combine Unit 1 (`39.5822`) and Unit 2 (`-2.0`):** The rules state signed numbers can combine with *other* units. The rule about eliminating units that sum to zero implies number units might combine via addition.\n    Assuming addition: `39.5822 + (-2.0)` = `37.5822`.\n    The remaining units would be `ceil` and `37.5822`. This is a possible interpretation.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe goal is to eventually reach 0. Applying the `ceil` operation simplifies the board by removing the operation unit and potentially making the numbers easier to work with. Combining `ceil` (0) with `39.5822` (1) results in `40.0`, an integer, which might be more useful later. Combining `ceil` (0) with `-2.0` (2) results in `-2.0`, leaving `39.5822` and `-2.0`. Both applying `ceil` are plausible first steps according to the examples.

Unit 0 (-2.0) fits this description.\n    *   The examples given (-10 with ×8 results in -80; -7 with ÷3 yields -2.33...) show a signed number combining with an operation unit.

Other combinations produce a new unit with the result.\n\n3.  **Analysis:**\n    *   We need to perform an operation this turn.\n    *   There are only two units (0 and 1), so the only possible combination is between Unit 0 and Unit 1.\n    *   How do Unit 0 (-2.0) and Unit 1 (40) combine?\n        *   Possibility A: Unit 1 (40) is treated as an implicit '+40' unit.

The rules state that units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. The units fitting this description are +6 (index 0), -7.0817 (index 2), and -2.0 (index 5).\n\nLet's examine possible combinations involving these signed number units:\n- Combining +6 with others: +6+floor -> floor(6)=6; +6+(-7.0817) -> -1.0817; +6+2 -> 8; +6+0 -> 6; +6+(-2.0) -> 4.0.\n- Combining -7.0817 with others: -7.0817+floor -> floor(-7.0817)=-8; -7.0817+2 -> -5.0817; -7.0817+0 -> -7.0817; -7.0817+(-2.0) -> -9.0817.\n- Combining -2.0 with others: -2.0+floor -> floor(-2.0)=-2; -2.0+2 -> 0; -2.0+0 -> -2.0.\n\nThe rule states that if the combination results in 0, no new unit is produced, meaning the combined units are eliminated. The combination of unit 5 (-2.0) and unit 3 (2) yields -2.0 + 2 = 0. This interpretation assumes that combining a signed number (+\/-N) with a plain number (M) results in standard addition\/subtraction (+\/-N + M). This combination eliminates two units directly, which is the most effective step towards the goal of eliminating all units.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to combine unit 5 and unit 3.\n\nAnswer: 5 3","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules to find the best move.\n\n**Board:**\n0: `6` (Number)\n1: `floor` (Operation)\n2: `-7.0817` (Signed Number)\n3: `0` (Number)\n\n**Objective:** Eliminate all units, making the final result 0.\n\n**Rules & Interpretation:**\n1.  Signed numbers (`+N` or `-N`) can combine with other units.\n2.  Examples suggest combining a signed number (`-10`) with an operation unit (`*8`) applies the operation using the signed number's value (`-10 * 8 = -80`).\n3.  Combining units that result in 0 removes both units and produces no new unit. This seems crucial for eliminating units.\n4.  The combination rules for number-number, number-operation, and signed number-number are not explicitly defined, but we need to make logical assumptions to reach the goal.\n\n**Possible First Moves & Outcomes:**\n\n*   **Combine `2` (`-7.0817`) and `1` (`floor`):**\n    *   Based on the examples, this likely means applying `floor` to `-7.0817`.\n    *   Result: `floor(-7.0817) = -8`.\n    *   New Board: `6`, `0`, `-8`.\n    *   *Next steps:* Combine `-8` with `6` (assume addition: `-8 + 6 = -2`). Board: `0`, `-2`. Combine `0` with `-2` (assume multiplication by 0 rule -> result 0, remove both). Board: Empty. **This path works.**\n\n*   **Combine `2` (`-7.0817`) and `0` (`6`):**\n    *   How do a signed number and a plain number combine? Maybe addition? `-7.0817 + 6 = -1.0817`. Or subtraction? `6 - 7.0817 = -1.0817`.\n    *   New Board: `floor`, `0`, `-1.0817`.\n    *   *Next steps:* Combine `0` with `-1.0817` (assume multiplication by 0 rule -> result 0, remove both). Board: `floor`. Cannot reach 0. This path seems unlikely to work unless `floor` can be eliminated somehow, or the combination assumption is wrong.\n\n*   **Combine `2` (`-7.0817`) and `3` (`0`):**\n    *   How do a signed number and the number `0` combine? Addition? `-7.0817 + 0 = -7.0817`. Subtraction? `0 - 7.0817 = -7.0817`. Multiplication? `-7.0817 * 0 = 0`.\n    *   If multiplication -> Result is 0. Rule says no new unit is produced. Remove `2` and `3`.\n    *   New Board: `6`, `floor`.\n    *   *Next steps:* Combine `6` with `floor` -> `floor(6) = 6`. Board: `6`. Cannot reach 0. This path doesn't work.\n\n*   **Combine `0` (`6`) and `1` (`floor`):**\n    *   How do a plain number and an operation combine? Maybe apply the operation to the number?\n    *   Result: `floor(6) = 6`.\n    *   New Board: `-7.0817`, `0`, `6`.\n    *   *Next steps:* Combine `-7.0817` with `6` (assume addition: `-7.0817 + 6 = -1.0817`). Board: `0`, `-1.0817`. Combine `0` with `-1.0817` (assume multiplication by 0 rule -> result 0, remove both). Board: Empty. **This path also works.**\n\n**Choosing the Move:**\nBoth combining `2 1` and `0 1` lead to a valid path to clear the board based on plausible interpretations of the rules. Combining the signed number (`-7.0817`) with an operation (`floor`) seems slightly more aligned with the provided examples (`-10` with `*8`, `-7` with `\/3`). Therefore, combining `2` and `1` is a reasonable choice.\n\n**Move:** Combine unit 2 (`-7.0817`) and unit 1 (`floor`).\n\nAnswer: 2 1","Based on the game rules and the current board state:\n1.  **Analyze the units:**\n    *   Unit 0: +6 (Value: 6, Operation: Addition)\n    *   Unit 1: 0 (Value: 0)\n    *   Unit 2: -8 (Value: -8, Operation: Subtraction\/Addition of -8)\n2.  **Game Objective:** Eliminate all units, resulting in 0. This happens when two units combine to make 0.\n3.  **Combination Rule:** Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units. Let's assume the combination involves adding the values of the units involved, as suggested by the elimination rule for +X and -X.\n4.  **Evaluate possible combinations:**\n    *   Combine Unit 0 (+6) and Unit 1 (0): 6 + 0 = 6. The units become +6, -8. No elimination.\n    *   Combine Unit 2 (-8) and Unit 1 (0): -8 + 0 = -8. The units become +6, -8. No elimination.\n    *   Combine Unit 0 (+6) and Unit 2 (-8): 6 + (-8) = -2. The units become 0, -2. No elimination, but the board state changes.\n5.  **Choose the best move:** No combination immediately results in 0 and eliminates units. Combining the two non-zero units (+6 and -8) simplifies the board by reducing the number of non-zero units. Combining Unit 0 and Unit 2 results in -2, leaving units 0 and -2 on the board. This seems like the most logical step towards potentially simplifying the state further, even if it doesn't immediately achieve the goal.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: 0\nUnit 1: -2\n\nRules for Combining:\n1.  Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. Unit 1 (-2) fits this. Unit 0 (0) doesn't explicitly have a + or - sign.\n2.  Examples: -10 with *8 -> -80; -7 with \/3 -> -2.33... (These show combining a signed number with an operator unit).\n3.  Combining two units resulting in 0 eliminates both units (no new unit produced). This is key for the objective. The example given is \"when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on\", which suggests addition (+X + -X = 0).\n4.  Objective: Eliminate all units, final result is 0.\n\nCurrent Task: Choose two units to combine.\n\nUnits available: 0 (index 0) and -2 (index 1).\n\nLet's consider combining them:\n*   If the combination rule for two numbers is always addition (implied by rule 3 example): Combine 0 and -2 -> 0 + (-2) = -2. This results in a new unit -2, replacing the original two. The board becomes [-2]. We haven't eliminated all units.\n*   If the combination rule involves multiplication: Combine 0 and -2 -> 0 * (-2) = 0. Since the result is 0, according to rule 3, both units are eliminated, and no new unit is produced. The board becomes empty. This achieves the objective.\n*   If unit '0' is special and eliminates anything it combines with: Combining 0 and -2 would eliminate both. This also achieves the objective.\n*   If unit '0' cannot be combined because it lacks a sign: We can only initiate a combination with unit 1 (-2). What operation does -2 perform on 0? If it means subtraction (as per the unit type description \"-number: ... subtraction operation\"), it could be 0 - 2 = -2. This replaces (0, -2) with (-2), which fails the objective.\n\nConsidering the objective is to eliminate all units ending in 0, and the rule that a combination resulting in 0 eliminates the units, the multiplication interpretation (0 * -2 = 0) or the '0 is special' interpretation are the most plausible ways to achieve the goal in one step. Both lead to combining units 0 and 1.\n\nI will combine unit 0 and unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

We need to perform operations that simplify the board and ideally create opposite numbers (+X and -X) to cancel each other out.\n\n1.  The number 34.5739 (index 1) has a decimal part.

This likely means either the last unit is 0, or all units are eliminated via the +\/- rule.\n\n**Strategy:**\nCurrently, there are no signed numbers, so the +\/- elimination rule cannot be used. We need to perform operations. The standard way is to apply an operator to an operand.\nLet's consider the operands and operators:\n- Operands: 2, 8, 0.0133\n- Operators: reciprocal, \/7\n\nPossible combinations (Operator index, Operand index):\n- 0 2: reciprocal(2) = 0.5\n- 0 4: reciprocal(8) = 0.125\n- 0 3: reciprocal(0.0133) = 1\/0.0133 ≈ 75.188\n- 1 2: 2 \/ 7 ≈ 0.2857\n- 1 4: 8 \/ 7 ≈ 1.1428\n- 1 3: 0.0133 \/ 7 ≈ 0.0019\n\nThe number 0.0133 is unusual. It might be an approximation of 1\/75 (which is 0.01333...). If we assume 0.0133 is 1\/75, then applying the reciprocal operator gives:\n- 0 3: reciprocal(1\/75) = 75.\nThis operation simplifies the board by replacing the decimal 0.0133 with the integer 75. This seems like a potentially useful first step towards simplifying the state.\n\nLet's choose this combination. Combine unit 0 (reciprocal) and unit 3 (0.0133).\n\nAnswer: 0 3","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  Units are:\n    *   0: \/7 (Division operator)\n    *   1: 2 (Assuming +2, a positive number unit)\n    *   2: 8 (Assuming +8, a positive number unit)\n    *   3: 75.18796992481204 (Assuming +75.18..., a positive number unit)\n2.  Rule: \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\" Assuming 1, 2, and 3 are implicitly positive number units (+2, +8, +75.18...), they can combine with the operator unit (\/7) or with each other.\n3.  Rule: Combining a signed number (+X or -X) with an operator (\/Y) results in the operation being applied (+X\/Y or -X\/Y). Example: (+8 combined with \/7 results in +8\/7).\n4.  Rule: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\". This implies that combining two signed numbers likely involves addition (e.g., +X combined with +Y results in +(X+Y)).\n5.  Goal: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n\nCurrent units: +2, +8, +75.18..., \/7.\nAll number units are positive. Combining positive numbers additively results in a positive number. Combining a positive number with \/7 results in a positive number. It seems impossible to reach 0 with the current units and rules, as there's no way to introduce a negative value or perform subtraction.\n\nHowever, the task is to output the operation for the current turn. I need to choose two units to combine. Let's analyze possible first moves:\n*   Combine 1 (+2) and 2 (+8): Results in +10. Board becomes: +10, +75.18..., \/7. This simplifies the board by combining the integers.\n*   Combine 1 (+2) and 0 (\/7): Results in +2\/7. Board becomes: +8, +75.18..., +2\/7.\n*   Combine 2 (+8) and 0 (\/7): Results in +8\/7. Board becomes: +2, +75.18..., +8\/7.\n*   Combine 3 (+75.18...) and 0 (\/7): Results in approx +10.74. Board becomes: +2, +8, +10.74...\n*   Combine 1 (+2) and 3 (+75.18...): Results in +77.18... Board becomes: +8, +77.18..., \/7.\n*   Combine 2 (+8) and 3 (+75.18...): Results in +83.18... Board becomes: +2, +83.18..., \/7.\n\nSince reaching 0 seems impossible, a reasonable strategy might be to simplify the board. Combining the two integer units (1 and 2) is a standard simplification step.\n\nMove: Combine unit 1 and unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: \/7 (Division by 7 operator)\nUnit 1: 75.18796992481204 (Implicitly a positive number, +75.18796992481204)\nUnit 2: 10 (Implicitly a positive number, +10)\n\nRules:\n- Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can initiate combinations.\n- Combining (+A) with (\/B) results in A\/B.\n- Combining (+A) with (+B) results in A+B.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with 0. This usually happens by combining +X and -X.\n- Operator units like \/7 cannot initiate combinations.\n\nAvailable moves initiated by signed number units (Unit 1 and Unit 2):\n1.  Combine Unit 1 (+75.18...) with Unit 0 (\/7): The result is 75.18796992481204 \/ 7 ≈ +10.74. The remaining units would be +10.74... and +10.\n2.  Combine Unit 1 (+75.18...) with Unit 2 (+10): The result is 75.18796992481204 + 10 = +85.18796992481204. The remaining units would be \/7 and +85.18....\n3.  Combine Unit 2 (+10) with Unit 0 (\/7): The result is 10 \/ 7 ≈ +1.43. The remaining units would be +75.18... and +1.43....\n4.  Combine Unit 2 (+10) with Unit 1 (+75.18...): The result is 10 + 75.18796992481204 = +85.18796992481204. This is the same outcome as move 2.\n\nCurrently, there are no negative numbers on the board, and none of the available operations seem to introduce one or lead directly to a result of 0 in the next step. Since the task is to output *the* operation for the current turn, any valid operation suffices. Combining the two numerical units seems like a reasonable step.

Usually, this involves creating a number and its opposite (e.g., +X and -X). We have -12.9997, which is very close to -13. Let's see if we can create +13 or something close to +12.9997 from the remaining units: +1, +5, +9, reciprocal, square.\n\nA possible way to get 13 is 5 + 9 - 1. We have +5 and +9. Combining them gives +14.\nLet's try combining 2 (+5) and 3 (+9).\nResult: +14.\nUnits remaining (conceptually): [reciprocal, +1, square, -12.9997, +14]\n\nNow, if we combine +14 and -12.9997, we get 14 - 12.9997 = +1.0003.\nUnits remaining: [reciprocal, +1, square, +1.0003]\nThis value +1.0003 is close to +1.

Examples suggest arithmetic operations or applying functions.\n- `+number`: Represents a positive number and addition.\n- `-number`: Represents a negative number and subtraction.\n- Other units are operations: `reciprocal`, `square`, `*number`, `\/number`, `sqrt`, `square`, `floor`, `ceil`.\n- Applying an operation (like `square`) to a number (like `14`) seems a valid combination (e.g., `square` on `14` yields `196`).\n- Combining two signed numbers likely involves addition\/subtraction based on their signs (e.g., `+14` combined with `-12.9997` could be `14 + (-12.9997)` or `14 - 12.9997`).\n\nObjective: Eliminate all units, reaching 0.\n\nLet's examine possible first moves:\n\n1.  **Apply `square` (2) to `+1` (1):** Results in `1^2 = 1`.

Board becomes `[reciprocal, +1, +14, +168.99]`. All positive numbers.\n3.  **Apply `square` (2) to `+14` (4):** Results in `14^2 = 196`. Board becomes `[reciprocal, +1, -12.9997, +196]`.\n4.  **Apply `reciprocal` (0) to `+1` (1):** Results in `1\/1 = 1`. Board becomes `[square, -12.9997, +14, +1]`. Same as case 1 essentially.\n5.  **Apply `reciprocal` (0) to `-12.9997` (3):** Results in `1 \/ -12.9997 ≈ -0.0769`. Board becomes `[+1, square, +14, -0.0769]`.\n6.  **Apply `reciprocal` (0) to `+14` (4):** Results in `1\/14`. Board becomes `[+1, square, -12.9997, +1\/14]`.\n7.  **Combine `+1` (1) and `-12.9997` (3):** Results in `1 + (-12.9997) = -11.9997`. Board becomes `[reciprocal, square, +14, -11.9997]`.\n8.  **Combine `+1` (1) and `+14` (4):** Results in `1 + 14 = 15`. Board becomes `[reciprocal, square, -12.9997, +15]`.\n9.  **Combine `-12.9997` (3) and `+14` (4):** Results in `-12.9997 + 14 = 1.0003`. Board becomes `[reciprocal, +1, square, +1.0003]`.\n\nOption 9 looks promising. The number -12.9997 is very close to -13. Combining it with +14 yields 1.0003, which is very close to +1. This significantly simplifies the board by removing the negative number and one positive number, leaving behind +1, +1.0003 (potentially treatable as +1), `reciprocal`, and `square`.\n\nLet's choose combining units 3 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","```\nAnalyzing the board and rules:\nBoard:\n0: reciprocal\n1: 1\n2: square\n3: 1.0002999999999993\n\nRules Summary:\n- Objective: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n- Elimination: Occurs when a positive number (+X) and a negative number (-X) with equal absolute values are combined (operated on).

Combine 2 (square) and 3 (1.000...): Result is square(1.000...) ≈ 1.0006. Board becomes [reciprocal, 1, 1.0006...].\n\nStrategic Consideration:\n- Moves 1 and 2 simplify the board by using an operation on the number 1, which results in 1 (reciprocal(1)=1, square(1)=1). This effectively removes one operator while keeping the number 1. This seems like a reasonable simplification. Both moves lead to a similar state (one operator, number 1, number 1.000...).\n- Moves 3 and 4 introduce new, potentially less clean numbers (0.9997... or 1.0006...).\n\nChoosing a Move:\n- Between move 1 (0 1) and move 2 (2 1), both seem equally valid as a first step. Let's choose one. Applying square to 1 is a simple operation. Let's choose combining unit 2 (square) with unit 1 (1).\n\nSelected move: Combine indices 2 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 2 1\n```","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\n**Board:**\n0: reciprocal\n1: 1.0002999999999993\n2: 1\n\n**Rules Summary:**\n- Signed number units (+\/- number) can combine with other units.\n- Combining a signed number with an operation unit applies the operation.\n- Goal: Eliminate all units, final result 0.\n- Elimination to 0 happens when combining +x and -x.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1.  The units `1.00029...` and `1` don't have explicit signs. Assuming they are implicitly positive, they become `+1.00029...` (unit 1) and `+1` (unit 2).\n2.  As signed units, they can combine with the `reciprocal` unit (unit 0).\n3.  Option 1: Combine unit 1 (`+1.00029...`) with unit 0 (`reciprocal`). This results in `+(1 \/ 1.00029...)` which is approximately `+0.9997`. The board would become: `+0.9997...` (unit 1) and `+1` (unit 2).\n4.  Option 2: Combine unit 2 (`+1`) with unit 0 (`reciprocal`). This results in `+(1 \/ 1)` which is `+1`. The board would become: `+1.00029...` (unit 1) and `+1` (unit 2).\n5.  The goal is to reach 0, which typically requires combining a positive and a negative number of equal magnitude. Currently, all operations result in positive numbers.\n6.  However, we must make a move. Applying the operation `reciprocal` to the exact value `1` (unit 2) seems like a cleaner step than applying it to the floating-point value `1.00029...`. This results in two positive units: `+1.00029...` and `+1`. How these eventually lead to 0 is unclear from the rules provided, but performing the operation is necessary.\n\nLet's perform the combination of unit 2 and unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Based on the board and the rules provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The board contains two units:\n    *   Unit 0: 1.0002999999999993\n    *   Unit 1: 1.0\n    These appear to be positive numerical values.\n\n2.  **Analyze the rules:**\n    *   The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n    *   Elimination typically occurs when a positive and a negative unit of equal absolute value are combined (e.g., +5 and -5).\n    *   Units like `+number` (addition) and `-number` (subtraction) can combine with other units.

Let's look for such opportunities.\n\n*   Combining `floor` (index 0 or 7) with `0.0724` (index 2): `floor(0.0724) = 0`. According to the rules, this combination results in 0, so both the `floor` unit and the `0.0724` unit should be eliminated.

Let's choose indices 0 and 2 for this.\n\n*   Combining `floor` (index 0 or 7) with `-6.7957` (index 1): `floor(-6.7957) = -7`.

This is also a good sequence.\n\n*   Combining `+6` (4) and `+3` (9) could result in `+9` (assuming addition for combining same-signed numbers). This `+9` could then cancel with `-9` (5).\n\n*   Combining `+7` (3) and `+2` (8) could result in `+9`, which could then cancel with `-9` (5).\n\nComparing the options, combining `floor` (0) and `0.0724` (2) directly eliminates two units via the special rule for combinations resulting in 0. This seems the most efficient first step towards clearing the board.\n\n**Proposed Move:**\nCombine unit 0 (floor) and unit 2 (0.0724). The operation is `floor(0.0724)`, which results in 0.

Signed number units can combine with any other unit.\n2.  Combining Number `N` with Operator `Op` results in `Op(N)`.\n3.  Combining Number `N1` (+a or -a) with Number `N2` (+b or -b) results in `a + b` (respecting signs), based on the description \"+number represents addition\" and \"-number represents subtraction\".\n4.  If a combination results in 0, both units are removed, and no new unit is created.\n5.  Goal: Eliminate all units (final result 0).\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe goal is to eliminate units, ideally by making combinations that result in 0.\nUnit 8 is 0. Combining 0 with an operator is a good way to eliminate both, as the result is often 0 or unchanged.\n-   Combine 8 (0) with 4 (*-8): The operation is 0 * -8 = 0. Since the result is 0, both units (8 and 4) are eliminated.\n-   Combine 8 (0) with 5 (floor): The operation is floor(0) = 0. Since the result is 0, both units (8 and 5) are eliminated.\n\nBoth moves (8 4) and (8 5) eliminate two units immediately. Let's consider the consequences:\n-   If we choose 8 4: We remove 0 and *-8. The board becomes: -6.7957, 7, 6, -9, floor, 2, 3. The 'floor' operator remains, which can be used on -6.7957 to get -7. This seems promising as there is a 7 on the board, potentially leading to another elimination (7 + -7 = 0).\n-   If we choose 8 5: We remove 0 and floor. The board becomes: -6.7957, 7, 6, -9, *-8, 2, 3. We lose the 'floor' operator. Applying *-8 to -6.7957 gives a non-integer result (54.3656), which seems less helpful.\n\nTherefore, combining 8 and 4 seems like a strategically better first move.\n\n**Chosen Move:** Combine unit 8 (0) and unit 4 (*-8).\n\nAnswer: 8 4","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: -6.7957\n1: 7\n2: 6\n3: -9\n4: floor\n5: 2\n6: 3\n7: 0\n\nUnits types and combination rules:\n- +\/- number: Represents a value and can combine with operators or other numbers. Assume standard addition when combining two number units (e.g., +A combines with +B as A+B, +A combines with -B as A-B).\n- floor: Operator that rounds a number down to the nearest integer. Combines with a +\/- number unit N to produce floor(N).\n- Goal: Eliminate all units by making combinations that result in 0. When a combination results in 0, both units are removed, and no new unit is produced.\n\nCurrent state analysis:\nWe have several numbers and one operator 'floor'.\nThe 'floor' operator can combine with any number. Let's see the results:\n- floor(unit 0: -6.7957) = -7\n- floor(unit 1: 7) = 7 (no change)\n- floor(unit 2: 6) = 6 (no change)\n- floor(unit 3: -9) = -9 (no change)\n- floor(unit 5: 2) = 2 (no change)\n- floor(unit 6: 3) = 3 (no change)\n- floor(unit 7: 0) = 0 (no change)\nThe only combination with 'floor' that changes a value is with unit 0. Combining unit 0 (-6.7957) and unit 4 (floor) yields -7.\n\nCombining numbers via addition:\nWe can look for pairs that might eventually sum to zero.\n- We have unit 1 (7). If we create -7 by combining 0 and 4, we can then combine 7 and -7 to make 0, eliminating both.\n- We have unit 3 (-9). We need a 9. We can create 9 by combining unit 2 (6) and unit 6 (3), since 6 + 3 = 9. Then we can combine 9 and -9 to make 0, eliminating both.\n\nLet's explore the sequence starting with floor:\n1. Combine 0 (-6.7957) and 4 (floor). Indices: 0 4. Result: -7.\n   Board becomes (conceptually): [-7, 7, 6, -9, 2, 3, 0]\n2. Combine the new -7 and unit 1 (7). Result: 0.

Result: 2 + 0 = 2.\n   Board becomes: [2]\nThis path does not eliminate all units to 0.\n\nLet's explore the sequence starting with creating 9:\n1. Combine 2 (6) and 6 (3). Indices: 2 6. Result: 9.\n   Board becomes: [-6.7957, 7, 9, -9, floor, 2, 0]\n2. Combine the new 9 and unit 3 (-9). Result: 0. Units eliminated.\n   Board becomes: [-6.7957, 7, floor, 2, 0]\n3.

Result: 2 + 0 = 2.\n   Board becomes: [2]\nThis path also does not eliminate all units to 0.\n\nBoth paths seem to simplify the board significantly by eliminating pairs that sum to 0, but leave [2, 0]. Assuming the puzzle intends for a full clear, there might be a missing rule or a nuance not captured. However, based on the provided rules and board, the steps towards cancellation are clear. Both 0 4 and 2 6 initiate a cancellation sequence. Applying 'floor' to the only non-integer seems like a reasonable first step to simplify the board state.\n\nTherefore, combining unit 0 (-6.7957) and unit 4 (floor) is a logical first move.\n\nAnswer: 0 4","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to eliminate all units by combining them, aiming for a final result of 0.

Units with signs (+N, -N) can combine with other units.\n2.  Combining +N and -N results in 0 and eliminates both units. This is the primary mechanism for achieving the objective.\n3.  Combining two signed numbers appears to follow addition based on their signs (e.g., +A combined with +B results in +(A+B); +A combined with -B results in +(A-B) or -(B-A)).\n4.  The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n\nStrategy:\nThe goal is elimination. The clearest path to elimination is creating a pair of units (+X, -X).\nThe board contains -9 (index 1). To eliminate it, we need a +9 unit.\nWe can create +9 by combining +6 (index 0) and +3 (index 3), assuming they combine via addition (+6 + +3 = +9).\n\nProposed Move:\nCombine unit 0 (+6) and unit 3 (+3).\n\nStep-by-step Plan (following this move):\n1.  Combine 0 (+6) and 3 (+3). Result: +9. Board becomes: +9, -9(1), +2(2), +0(4).\n2.  Combine the new +9 and 1 (-9). Result: 0 (Elimination). Board becomes: +2(2), +0(4).\n3.  To eliminate the remaining +2 and +0, we must assume a way to eliminate them. If combining with 0 eliminates the other unit (a plausible interpretation if the goal is achievable), combining +2 and +0 would clear the board.\n\nThe first required step in this plan is combining units 0 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 0 3","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nBoard:\n0: -9\n1: 2\n2: 0\n3: 9\n\nRules state:\n- Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.

This means the two units are eliminated.\n- The objective is to eliminate all units, meaning the final result is 0.\n\nWe have unit 0 (-9) and unit 3 (9). These are a negative and a positive number with equal absolute values (|-9| = 9, |+9| = 9).\nAccording to the rule, combining them results in 0, and they are eliminated. This is a direct step towards the objective of eliminating all units.\n\nLet's combine unit 0 and unit 3.\n\nAnswer: 0 3","To achieve the objective of eliminating all units resulting in 0, we need to combine the existing units.\nThe current units are:\nUnit 0: +2\nUnit 1: 0\n\nAccording to the rules, a unit like +2 (a sign followed by a number) can combine with other units. It represents both the value +2 and the addition operation.\nLet's consider combining Unit 0 (+2) and Unit 1 (0).\n\nInterpretation 1: Apply the operation of Unit 0 (+) to the value of Unit 1 (0).\nResult = 0 + 2 = 2. This would leave a single unit +2 on the board, which does not satisfy the objective of eliminating all units or resulting in 0.\n\nInterpretation 2: Consider if the '0' unit has a special property. Since the goal is explicitly to reach 0, perhaps combining any numerical unit with the '0' unit results in 0.\nResult = 0. This satisfies the game objective.\n\nGiven the objective, the only productive move is to combine the two existing units.

Board becomes {sq, -3, +2, sq, +7.4495}.\n    *   Combine 0 (-10) and 3 (+2): -10 + 2 = -8. Board becomes {sq, -8, +7, sq, +7.4495}.\n    *   Combine 0 (-10) and 5 (+7.4495): -10 + 7.4495 = -2.5505. Board becomes {sq, +7, +2, sq, -2.5505}.\n    *   Combine 2 (+7) and 3 (+2): 7 + 2 = 9. Board becomes {-10, sq, sq, +7.4495, +9}.\n    *   Combine 2 (+7) and 5 (+7.4495): 7 + 7.4495 = 14.4495. Board becomes {-10, sq, +2, sq, +14.4495}.\n    *   Combine 3 (+2) and 5 (+7.4495): 2 + 7.4495 = 9.4495. Board becomes {-10, sq, +7, sq, +9.4495}.\n    Combining 2 (+7) and 3 (+2) results in +9, simplifying two basic integers into one. This reduces the number of units on the board from 6 to 5 and seems like a reasonable simplification step.\n\n2.  Combine a number unit with an operation unit (square):\n    *   Combine 0 (-10) and 1 (square): (-10)^2 = 100. Board becomes {+100, +7, +2, sq, +7.4495}.\n    *   Combine 2 (+7) and 1 (square): 7^2 = 49. Board becomes {-10, +49, +2, sq, +7.4495}.\n    *   Combine 3 (+2) and 1 (square): 2^2 = 4. Board becomes {-10, +4, +7, sq, +7.4495}.\n    *   Combine 5 (+7.4495) and 1 (square): 7.4495^2 ≈ 55.495. Board becomes {-10, +55.495, +7, +2, sq}.\n    These moves also reduce the board complexity but introduce potentially large or non-integer numbers early on.\n\nConsidering the options, combining the two simple positive integers +7 and +2 seems like a good first step to simplify the board state without introducing complex numbers immediately. It reduces the unit count and combines units 2 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nThe goal is to eliminate all units, ending with a result of 0.\nThe units are:\n0: -10 (Value: -10)\n1: square (Operation: N^2)\n2: square (Operation: N^2)\n3: 7.4495 (Value: +7.4495, assuming unsigned numbers are positive)\n4: 9 (Value: +9, assuming unsigned numbers are positive)\n\nRules for combination:\n- Signed number (+\/- N) combined with an operation (Op): Result is Op(N). For square, square(+\/- N) = N^2. Example: square(-10) = (-10)^2 = 100. Example: square(9) = 9^2 = 81.\n- Combining two numbers (+\/- N1, +\/- N2): Result is N1 + N2 (standard addition). If the result is 0, the units are eliminated without producing a new unit.\n- Combining two operations or operation + unsigned number: The rule was cut off, but typical interpretation is applying the operation to the number.\n\nWe need a sequence of combinations that results in 0. We start with -10, so we eventually need a +10 to cancel it out via addition.\n\nLet's explore possible first moves:\n\n1.  Combine -10 (0) with square (1): Results in square(-10) = +100. Remaining: {square(2), 7.4495(3), 9(4), +100}.\n2.  Combine 9 (4) with square (1): Results in square(9) = +81. Remaining: {-10(0), square(2), 7.4495(3), +81}.\n3.  Combine 7.4495 (3) with square (1): Results in square(7.4495) = 55.49500025 (approx +55.495). Remaining: {-10(0), square(2), 9(4), +55.495}.\n4.  Combine -10 (0) with 9 (4): Results in -10 + 9 = -1. Remaining: {square(1), square(2), 7.4495(3), -1}.\n5.  Combine -10 (0) with 7.4495 (3): Results in -10 + 7.4495 = -2.5505. Remaining: {square(1), square(2), 9(4), -2.5505}.\n6.  Combine 7.4495 (3) with 9 (4): Results in 7.4495 + 9 = 16.4495. Remaining: {-10(0), square(1), square(2), +16.4495}.\n\nLet's analyze the path starting from move 4 (Combine 0 and 4 -> -1):\n- Board: square(1), square(2), 7.4495(3), -1(new 0)\n- Combine -1(0) and square(1) -> square(-1) = +1.\n- Board: square(2), 7.4495(3), +1(new 0)\n- Combine 7.4495(3) and square(2) -> square(7.4495) = +55.495.\n- Board: +1(0), +55.495(new 1)\n- Combine +1(0) and +55.495(1) -> +56.495. Does not reach 0.\n\nLet's analyze the path starting from move 2 (Combine 4 and 1 -> 81):\n- Board: -10(0), square(2), 7.4495(3), +81(new 1)\n- Combine 7.4495(3) and square(2) -> square(7.4495) = +55.495.\n- Board: -10(0), +81(1), +55.495(new 2)\n- Combine +81(1) and +55.495(2) -> 81 + 55.495 = +136.495.\n- Board: -10(0), +136.495(new 1)\n- Combine -10(0) and +136.495(1) -> -10 + 136.495 = +126.495. Does not reach 0.\n\nLet's analyze the path starting from move 1 (Combine 0 and 1 -> 100):\n- Board: square(2), 7.4495(3), 9(4), +100(new 0)\n- Combine 9(4) and square(2) -> square(9) = +81.\n- Board: 7.4495(3), +100(0), +81(new 1)\n- Combine +100(0) and +81(1) -> 100 + 81 = +181.\n- Board: 7.4495(3), +181(new 0)\n- Combine 7.4495(3) and +181(0) -> 7.4495 + 181 = +188.4495. Does not reach 0.\n\nGiven these standard interpretations, none of the immediate paths seem to lead directly to zero. However, combining integers (like 9) with operations (like square) often simplifies the board state cleanly. Combining 9 (index 4) with square (index 1 or 2) results in 81. Let's choose 4 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nBoard:\n0: -10\n1: square\n2: 7.4495\n3: 81\n\nRules for Combination:\n- Units like '+number' or '-number' can combine with other units. Examples show them combining with multiplicative\/divisive operations (*N, \/N) where the +\/- number provides the value (e.g., -10 with x8 results in -10 * 8 = -80).\n- Operations like 'square' likely apply to number units.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0. This typically happens by combining a number X with its negative counterpart -X.\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\nWe have a -10 unit (index 0). To reach the goal of 0, we likely need to create a +10 unit eventually.\nWe have the 'square' operation (index 1) and two numbers: 7.4495 (index 2) and 81 (index 3).\n\nPossible First Moves:\n1.  Apply 'square' (1) to '7.4495' (2): This would result in 7.4495^2 ≈ 55.4948... The board would become {-10, 81, ~55.5}.\n2.  Apply 'square' (1) to '81' (3): This would result in 81^2 = 6561. The board would become {-10, 7.4495, 6561}.\n3.  Combine '-10' (0) with 'square' (1): Following the pattern of examples (-10 with x8 = -10*8), this might mean applying 'square' to -10, resulting in (-10)^2 = 100. The board would become {7.4495, 81, 100}. This leaves only positive numbers, making it impossible to reach 0.\n4.  Combine '-10' (0) with '7.4495' (2) or '81' (3): The rules for combining a +\/- number with a plain number are unclear. If it implies addition\/subtraction (e.g., 81 - 10 = 71) or multiplication (e.g., -10 * 81 = -810), these don't seem helpful compared to the examples given.\n\nEvaluating Moves 1 and 2:\nApplying the 'square' operation to one of the numbers is the most standard interpretation.\n- Move 1 (1 2): Results in {-10, 81, ~55.5}. Getting +10 from 81 and 55.5 seems difficult.\n- Move 2 (1 3): Results in {-10, 7.4495, 6561}. Getting +10 from 7.4495 and 6561 seems difficult.\n\nHowever, we must choose a move. Applying an operation to a number is the most likely intended action. Between squaring 7.4495 and 81, squaring 81 involves an integer and a perfect square (81=9^2), which might be more likely to lead to a structured solution path, even if it's not immediately obvious how 6561 helps. Let's choose this option.\n\nAction: Combine unit 1 (square) and unit 3 (81).\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Based on the rules and the board provided:\n1.  **Identify Units:**\n    *   Unit 0: -10 (Type: -number)\n    *   Unit 1: 7.4495 (Type: +number, implicit positive sign)\n    *   Unit 2: 6561 (Type: +number, implicit positive sign)\n2.  **Understand Combination Rules:**\n    *   Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n    *   Examples (-10 with *8 -> -80; -7 with \/3 -> -2.33...) suggest that when a +\/- unit combines with an operator unit (*, \/), the +\/- unit acts as the first operand, and the operator unit dictates the operation and the second operand.\n    *   The rule for combining two +\/- units is less explicit. The description \"+number: ... represents the addition operation\" and \"-number: ... represents the subtraction operation\" could imply the first unit's operation is used. However, a simpler and common interpretation for combining two numbers is addition. Let's assume combining unit A (+\/- a) and unit B (+\/- b) results in `value(A) + value(B)`.\n    *   Goal: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0. Combining units removes the original two and adds the result. If the result is 0, nothing is added.\n3.  **Evaluate Possible First Moves (assuming addition for two +\/- units):**\n    *   Combine 0 (-10) and 1 (7.4495): Result = -10 + 7.4495 = -2.5505. Remaining units: [-2.5505, 6561].\n    *   Combine 0 (-10) and 2 (6561): Result = -10 + 6561 = 6551. Remaining units: [6551, 7.4495].\n    *   Combine 1 (7.4495) and 2 (6561): Result = 7.4495 + 6561 = 6568.4495. Remaining units: [-10, 6568.4495].\n4.  **Analyze Outcomes:**\n    *   Under the addition assumption, all possible first moves lead to a state with two units remaining. The sum of the remaining units in all cases is 6558.4495 (-2.5505 + 6561 = 6558.4495; 6551 + 7.4495 = 6558.4495; -10 + 6568.4495 = 6558.4495).\n    *   No single move immediately leads to 0 or an obvious path towards 0 based solely on addition.\n    *   There might be a hidden relationship between the numbers (e.g., sqrt(6561)=81, sqrt(81)=9, sqrt(9)=3) or a different interpretation of the combination rule for two +\/- units is intended. However, based on the provided information, simple addition is the most direct interpretation.\n5.  **Choose a Move:** Since all moves seem equivalent under the simplest interpretation, any pair can be chosen. Combining the first and the last unit (0 and 2) is a reasonable arbitrary choice.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the game board and rules provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The board contains two units:\n    *   Unit 0: `7.4495`\n    *   Unit 1: `6551`\n    Neither unit has an explicit sign (+\/-) nor is an explicit operator type (*, \/, sqrt, etc.).\n\n2.  **Interpret the units:** The rules state that units like `+number` and `-number` can combine with others. The rule for units without a sign (like the ones on the board) is incomplete (\"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\"). Lacking a specific rule, the most reasonable assumption is that these numbers represent positive values, i.e., `+7.4495` and `+6551`.\n\n3.  **Determine possible combinations:** The only possible action is to combine the two existing units (index 0 and index 1). How they combine is ambiguous:\n    *   If they add (as suggested by `+number` also representing addition): `7.4495 + 6551 = 6558.4495`. This results in a single unit `+6558.4495`.\n    *   Other arithmetic operations are possible but not explicitly supported by rules for combining two positive value units.\n    *   Crucially, combining these two positive numbers using standard interpretations does not result in 0, which is the game's objective.\n\n4.  **Choose the action:** Regardless of the outcome and the ambiguity in the rules for achieving the final objective (result 0), the task is to output the operation for the *current turn*. Since there are only two units, the only possible operation is to combine them. The indices for these units are 0 and 1.\n\n5.  **Format the output:** The required format is 'Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER', where $YOUR_ANSWER consists of the two unit indices separated by a space.\n\nTherefore, the operation for the current turn is to combine unit 0 and unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Applying 'ceil' rounds a number up to the nearest integer.\nLet's try applying 'ceil' to the non-integer numbers:\n- Applying ceil (e.g., unit 1) to unit 4 (-27.7447): ceil(-27.7447) = -27.\n- Applying ceil (e.g., unit 2) to unit 7 (+0.8698): ceil(0.8698) = +1.\n\nIf we perform these two operations:\n1.

The first step in this sequence is combining unit 4 and unit 1 (or unit 4 and unit 2, or unit 7 and unit 1, or unit 7 and unit 2). Any of these first steps leads towards the goal.\n\nLet's choose combining unit 4 and unit 1 as the first move.\n\nAnswer: 4 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: 9\n1: ceil\n2: 10\n3: -6\n4: 3\n5: 0.8698\n6: 10\n7: -27\n\nUnits: [9, ceil, 10, -6, 3, 0.8698, 10, -27]\n\nObjective: Combine units until the result is 0, eliminating all units.\n\nRules:\n- Signed numbers (+\/- number) can combine with other units.\n- Operations like ceil apply to numbers.\n- Combining +X and -X removes both.\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\nWe have number units (9, 10, -6, 3, 0.8698, 10, -27) and one operation unit (ceil).\nThe operation unit `ceil` (index 1) can be applied to a number unit. Applying it to the non-integer 0.8698 (index 5) seems like a good simplification step.\nLet's calculate ceil(0.8698): ceil(0.8698) = 1.\n\nIf we combine unit 1 and unit 5, the result is 1. The board state would effectively become [9, 10, -6, 3, 1, 10, -27] (conceptually, the original units 1 and 5 are replaced by the result 1).\n\nLet's check the sum of the number units after this operation:\n9 + 10 + (-6) + 3 + 1 + 10 + (-27)\n= 19 - 6 + 3 + 1 + 10 - 27\n= 13 + 3 + 1 + 10 - 27\n= 16 + 1 + 10 - 27\n= 17 + 10 - 27\n= 27 - 27\n= 0\n\nSince the sum of the resulting numbers is 0, it means they can eventually be combined (through additions\/subtractions represented by the signed numbers) to completely cancel each other out, achieving the game objective.\n\nTherefore, combining `ceil` (index 1) with `0.8698` (index 5) is a logical first step.\n\nAnswer: 1 5","Based on the rules and the board state:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Board:**\n    The units are:\n    0: +9\n    1: +10\n    2: -6\n    3: +3\n    4: +10\n    5: -27\n    6: +1\n\n2.  **Understand the Goal:**\n    The objective is to eliminate all units, meaning the final result is 0. The key rule for elimination is: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced.\" This implies combining +X and -X removes both units.\n\n3.  **Check the Current State:**\n    Calculate the sum of the current units: 9 + 10 - 6 + 3 + 10 - 27 + 1 = 1.\n    Since the sum is not 0, we cannot immediately pair all units to cancel out. Furthermore, there are no existing pairs of (+X, -X).\n\n4.  **Strategy:**\n    To reach a state where all units can be eliminated via cancellation (+X pairs with -X), the total sum of the units on the board must eventually become 0. Combining two units A and B normally replaces them with a new unit representing their combination. Assuming the combination of number units is addition (A+B), combining A and B replaces them with A+B. The change in the total sum is (A+B) - (A+B) = 0. Therefore, standard combinations preserve the total sum.\n    However, the cancellation rule (+X combines with -X) removes both units, changing the sum by -(+X + -X) = 0.\n    This leads to a contradiction: If all operations preserve the sum, and the initial sum is 1, it seems impossible to reach a state where the sum is 0 or all units are eliminated.\n\n    Let's reconsider the combination rule and the goal. Perhaps \"eliminate all units\" means reaching a state with zero units *after* applying the cancellation rule whenever possible. If combining A and B results in A+B, the sum is preserved. Maybe one of the combinations can create a state where the sum becomes 0?\n    Let's test combining units A and B to produce A+B, replacing A and B.\n    Initial Sum = 1.\n    - Combine 0 (+9) and 2 (-6): Result +3. New sum = (Sum) - 9 - (-6) + 3 = 1 - 9 + 6 + 3 = 1. Sum is preserved.\n    - Combine 3 (+3) and 2 (-6): Result -3. New sum = (Sum) - 3 - (-6) + (-3) = 1 - 3 + 6 - 3 = 1. Sum is preserved.\n    - Combine 1 (+10) and 4 (+10): Result +20. New sum = (Sum) - 10 - 10 + 20 = 1 - 10 - 10 + 20 = 1. Sum is preserved.\n    - Combine 5 (-27) and 0 (+9): Result -18. New sum = (Sum) - (-27) - 9 + (-18) = 1 + 27 - 9 - 18 = 1. Sum is preserved.\n\n    It appears standard addition preserves the sum of 1, making the goal impossible under this interpretation. There might be a misunderstanding of the rules or an unstated mechanic. However, if we strictly follow the interpretation that leads to a solvable path (as explored in the thought process where combining A and B leads to a state where the *remaining* units sum to 0, even though the calculation seems paradoxical under simple replacement), several moves work. For instance:\n    - Combining 0(+9) and 2(-6) leaves {+10, +3, +10, -27, +1, +3} which sums to 0.\n    - Combining 3(+3) and 2(-6) leaves {+9, +10, +10, -27, +1, -3} which sums to 0.\n    - Combining 1(+10) and 4(+10) leaves {+9, -6, +3, -27, +1, +20} which sums to 0.\n\n    Since multiple moves allow progress towards a state where cancellation is possible (sum=0), any of these could be a valid first step. Let's choose the combination of the two identical units, 1 (+10) and 4 (+10).\n\n5.  **Select Move:**\n    Combine unit 1 (+10) and unit 4 (+10).\n\nAnswer: 1 4","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\nBoard Units:\n0: +9\n1: -6\n2: +3\n3: -27\n4: +1\n5: +20\n\nRules Summary:\n- Signed number units (+X, -Y) can combine with other units.\n- The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in a final combined value of 0.\n- Combining units that result in 0 (like +X and -X) causes them to be removed without producing a new unit.\n- Based on the objective and the cancellation rule, it's implied that combining two signed numbers likely means adding them algebraically.\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\nThe sum of the current units is 9 - 6 + 3 - 27 + 1 + 20 = 3 + 3 - 27 + 1 + 20 = 6 - 27 + 1 + 20 = -21 + 1 + 20 = -20 + 20 = 0.\nSince the total sum is already 0, any combination of two signed numbers (by adding them) will preserve the total sum of 0 across the remaining and newly formed units. The goal is to combine them strategically until only 0 remains, likely by creating pairs that cancel (+X and -X).\n\nChoosing an Operation:\nWe need to select two units to combine. Any pair of the signed number units can be combined. Let's consider a possible sequence:\n1. Combine +9 (index 0) and +1 (index 4): 9 + 1 = 10. Board becomes: +10, -6, +3, -27, +20.\n2.

Combine +10 and -3: 10 + (-3) = 7. Board becomes: +7, -7.\n5. Combine +7 and -7: 7 + (-7) = 0. All units eliminated.\n\nThis sequence works. The first step is combining unit 0 and unit 4.\n\nAlternatively:\n1. Combine +9 (index 0) and -6 (index 1): 9 + (-6) = 3. Board: +3, +3, -27, +1, +20\nThis path also leads to zero eventually.\n\nSince multiple first moves are possible, I will choose the first one I explored that leads to elimination. Combining unit 0 (+9) and unit 4 (+1).\n\nAnswer Format:\nThe required format is \"Answer: index1 index2\".\n\nMy chosen action is combining unit 0 and unit 4.\n\nAnswer: 0 4","Okay, I understand the game.

The units on the board are:\n0: -6\n1: +3 (implicitly positive)\n2: -27\n3: +20 (implicitly positive)\n4: +10 (implicitly positive)\n\nThe rule for combining two number units (+\/- number) seems to be algebraic addition, based on the goal of reaching 0 and the rule about units summing to 0 disappearing.\n\nThe sum of the current units is -6 + 3 - 27 + 20 + 10 = -3 - 27 + 20 + 10 = -30 + 30 = 0.\nSince the total sum is already 0, any sequence of combinations that correctly pairs up positive and negative values will eventually lead to clearing the board.\n\nI need to choose two units to combine for the first move. Let's try combining the two largest positive numbers:\nUnit 3 (+20) and Unit 4 (+10).\nCombining them results in 20 + 10 = 30.\nThe board state would become: -6, 3, -27, 30.\n\nLet's see if this path leads to a solution:\n1. Combine 3 (+20) and 4 (+10). Indices: 3 4. Result: 30. Board: -6, 3, -27, 30.\n2. Combine 1 (+3) and the new 30. Result: 3 + 30 = 33. Board: -6, -27, 33.\n3. Combine 0 (-6) and 2 (-27). Result: -6 + (-27) = -33. Board: -33, 33.\n4. Combine the remaining -33 and 33. Result: -33 + 33 = 0. All units eliminated.\n\nThis sequence successfully eliminates all units. Therefore, combining units at index 3 and index 4 is a valid first move.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","Okay, I understand the rules. I need to find a pair of units to combine such that following the combination steps eventually leads to the elimination of all units (a final result of 0).\n\nCurrent Board:\n0: -6\n1: 3\n2: -27\n3: 30\n\nLet's analyze the possible combinations and their outcomes, assuming combining unit A with unit B (+X or -X) means performing Value(A) + X or Value(A) - X. The goal is to reach a state where all units are eliminated, which happens if the final combination results in 0.\n\nOption 1: Combine 0 (-6) and 1 (3).\n   - Operation: -6 + 3 = -3\n   - Remaining units: [-3, -27, 30]\n   - Next, combine -3 and -27: -3 - 27 = -30. Remaining: [-30, 30]\n   - Finally, combine -30 and 30: -30 + 30 = 0. Goal achieved.\n   - This path works. The first move is combining indices 0 and 1.\n\nOption 2: Combine 2 (-27) and 3 (30).\n   - Operation: -27 + 30 = 3\n   - Remaining units: [-6, 3, 3]\n   - Next, combine -6 and 3: -6 + 3 = -3. Remaining: [-3, 3]\n   - Finally, combine -3 and 3: -3 + 3 = 0. Goal achieved.\n   - This path also works. The first move is combining indices 2 and 3.\n\nBoth moves (0 1) and (2 3) are valid starting steps towards the objective. I will choose the first valid pair I found.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nThe board has three units:\n0: -27\n1: 30\n2: -3\n\nThe goal is to combine units until the final result is 0, eliminating all units.\nThe rules state that units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. When combining two such units, the simplest interpretation is that they are added together. If a combination results in 0, no new unit is produced. This is how units are ultimately eliminated.\n\nLet's consider the possible combinations for the current turn:\n\n1.  Combine unit 0 (-27) and unit 1 (30):\n    - Calculation: -27 + 30 = 3\n    - Resulting units: +3 (new unit) and -3 (unit 2).\n    - Next step: Combine +3 and -3. 3 + (-3) = 0. No new unit produced. All units eliminated. Goal reached.\n\n2.  Combine unit 0 (-27) and unit 2 (-3):\n    - Calculation: -27 + (-3) = -30\n    - Resulting units: -30 (new unit) and +30 (unit 1).\n    - Next step: Combine -30 and +30. -30 + 30 = 0. No new unit produced. All units eliminated. Goal reached.\n\n3.  Combine unit 1 (30) and unit 2 (-3):\n    - Calculation: 30 + (-3) = 27\n    - Resulting units: +27 (new unit) and -27 (unit 0).\n    - Next step: Combine +27 and -27. 27 + (-27) = 0. No new unit produced. All units eliminated. Goal reached.\n\nAll three possible combinations lead to a state where the remaining two units sum to zero, thus achieving the game objective in the next step. Any of these combinations is a valid first move. I will choose to combine units 0 and 2.\n\nIndices to combine: 0 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Answer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

I need to find a pair of units to combine on the current board to work towards the goal of eliminating all units (resulting in 0).\n\nHere's the current board state:\n0: \/-2 (Operation: Divide by -2)\n1: reciprocal (Operation: 1\/x)\n2: 0.1667 (Number)\n3: 7 (Number)\n4: 107.9254 (Number)\n5: \/-5 (Operation: Divide by -5)\n6: 2 (Number)\n7: 1 (Number)\n8: 4 (Number)\n9: ceil (Operation: Round up)\n\nAssuming the numbers without explicit signs are positive, the board is:\n0: \/-2\n1: reciprocal\n2: +0.1667\n3: +7\n4: +107.9254\n5: \/-5\n6: +2\n7: +1\n8: +4\n9: ceil\n\nThe goal is to reach 0, which primarily happens by combining a positive number +N and a negative number -N with the same absolute value. Operations like \/-2 and \/-5 can be used to create negative numbers from positive ones.\n\nLet's consider combining unit 6 (+2) and unit 0 (\/-2).\nAccording to the rules, combining a signed number (+2) with an operation (\/-2) is allowed.\nThe result is 2 \/ -2 = -1.\nThis operation removes units 6 and 0 and adds a new unit -1 to the board.\n\nThe new board state would be:\n1: reciprocal\n2: +0.1667\n3: +7\n4: +107.9254\n5: \/-5\n7: +1\n8: +4\n9: ceil\nNew: -1\n\nIn the next step, the new unit -1 can be combined with unit 7 (+1). Combining +1 and -1 results in 0, eliminating both units.

Combining them results in 1 + (-1) = 0, which eliminates both units according to the rules.\n\nAnswer: 5 8","Okay, I will analyze the board and choose the best operation for this turn according to the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: reciprocal\n1: 0.1667 (+0.1667)\n2: 7 (+7)\n3: 107.9254 (+107.9254)\n4: \/-5\n5: 4 (+4)\n6: ceil\n\nRules recap:\n- Combine a number unit (+\/- N) with an operation unit (Op M).\n- The result replaces the two combined units.\n- Goal is to eliminate all units (final result 0).\n\nPossible combinations involving number units and operation units:\n1.  Combine 1 (+0.1667) with 0 (reciprocal): reciprocal(0.1667) ≈ 6.\n2.  Combine 1 (+0.1667) with 4 (\/-5): 0.1667 \/ -5 ≈ -0.0333.\n3.  Combine 1 (+0.1667) with 6 (ceil): ceil(0.1667) = 1.\n4.  Combine 2 (+7) with 0 (reciprocal): reciprocal(7) ≈ 0.1428.\n5.  Combine 2 (+7) with 4 (\/-5): 7 \/ -5 = -1.4.\n6.  Combine 2 (+7) with 6 (ceil): ceil(7) = 7. (No change, likely not useful unless it removes the ceil unit).\n7.  Combine 3 (+107.9254) with 0 (reciprocal): reciprocal(107.9254) ≈ 0.0093.\n8.  Combine 3 (+107.9254) with 4 (\/-5): 107.9254 \/ -5 ≈ -21.585.\n9.  Combine 3 (+107.9254) with 6 (ceil): ceil(107.9254) = 108.\n10. Combine 5 (+4) with 0 (reciprocal): reciprocal(4) = 0.25.\n11. Combine 5 (+4) with 4 (\/-5): 4 \/ -5 = -0.8.\n12. Combine 5 (+4) with 6 (ceil): ceil(4) = 4. (No change, likely not useful).\n\nObservations:\n- The number 0.1667 is very close to 1\/6.\n- Combining 1 (+0.1667) with 6 (ceil) yields 1. This significantly simplifies the board by introducing a clean integer '1'.\n- Combining 1 (+0.1667) with 0 (reciprocal) yields approximately 6. Also a simplification.\n- Combining 3 (+107.9254) with 6 (ceil) yields 108. Also a simplification.\n- Combining numbers with \/-5 introduces negative numbers, which might be necessary later to cancel positive numbers and reach zero.\n\nComparing the simplification options:\n- Option 3 (1 and 6 -> +1): Seems very promising as +1 is easy to work with.\n- Option 1 (1 and 0 -> ≈+6): Also good, but involves approximation if 0.1667 isn't exactly 1\/6.\n- Option 9 (3 and 6 -> +108): Creates a larger integer.\n\nCombining unit 1 (+0.1667) and unit 6 (ceil) seems like the best first step to simplify the boardstate cleanly. It replaces `0.1667` and `ceil` with `1`.\n\nSelected move: Combine unit 1 and unit 6.\n\nAnswer: 1 6","Okay, I will analyze the board and rules to determine the best move.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe current units are:\n0: reciprocal (Operation: 1\/x)\n1: 7 (Value: +7)\n2: 107.9254 (Value: +107.9254)\n3: \/-5 (Operation: x \/ -5)\n4: 4 (Value: +4)\n5: 1 (Value: +1)\n\n**Game Objective:**\nEliminate all units by reaching a combined result of 0. This typically happens when a combination yields 0, often by combining +X and -X (assuming they combine via addition, as hinted by the rule about reaching 0).\n\n**Rule Interpretation:**\n- Units with \"+\/- number\" combine with other units. Examples show combination with operator units (*, \/).\n- The rule \"+number: ... also represents the addition operation\" and \"-number: ... also represents the subtraction operation\" is ambiguous. It could mean that combining +X with Y results in X+Y, or that combining +X and -Y results in X+(-Y).\n- The rule about reaching 0 suggests +X and -X cancel each other out.\n- Let's assume that number units (like 4 and 1, interpreted as +4 and +1) can combine, potentially via addition based on the ambiguous rule interpretation.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe goal is to simplify the board towards 0. A common strategy in such games is to create pairs of numbers that cancel out (+X and -X).\n1.  We can create negative numbers using the `\/-5` operator (unit 3).\n2.  We can create fractions using the `reciprocal` operator (unit 0).\n3.  If we assume number units combine via addition, we can combine unit 4 (+4) and unit 5 (+1) to get +5.\n\n**Evaluating Potential First Moves:**\n1.  **Combine 4 (+4) and 5 (+1):** Assuming addition, this yields +5.\n    *   Board becomes: {reciprocal, +7, +107.9254, \/-5, +5}.\n    *   Next possible move: Combine the new +5 with \/-5. This yields +5 \/ -5 = -1.\n    *   Board becomes: {reciprocal, +7, +107.9254, -1}.\n    *   This path creates a simple integer -1, which might be easier to cancel later if we can create a +1.\n2.  **Combine 4 (+4) and 3 (\/-5):** This yields +4 \/ -5 = -0.8.\n    *   Board becomes: {reciprocal, +7, +107.9254, +1, -0.8}.\n    *   We would need to create +0.8 from the remaining units to cancel this out.\n3.  **Combine 5 (+1) and 3 (\/-5):** This yields +1 \/ -5 = -0.2.\n    *   Board becomes: {reciprocal, +7, +107.9254, +4, -0.2}.\n    *   We would need to create +0.2 from the remaining units.\n4.  **Combine 5 (+1) and 0 (reciprocal):** This yields 1\/+1 = +1.\n    *   Board becomes: {+7, +107.9254, \/-5, +4, +1}. (reciprocal is used).\n\nComparing these, Path 1 seems promising because it leads to the integer -1 by utilizing both +4, +1 and the \/-5 operator efficiently. This assumes the addition rule interpretation for combining number units.\n\n**Chosen Move:**\nCombine unit 4 (+4) and unit 5 (+1).\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide the two corresponding unit indices, separated by a space. The indices are 4 and 5.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","Combine unit 4 (5) with unit 3 (\/-5):\n5 \/ -5 = -1\n\nThe indices of the units to combine are 4 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 4 3","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: reciprocal (Operation)\n1: 7 (Implicitly +7, Number\/Operation Add 7)\n2: 107.9254 (Implicitly +107.9254, Number\/Operation Add 107.9254)\n3: -1.0 (Number -1.0 \/ Operation Subtract 1.0)\n\nRules suggest:\n- Combining a Number unit (+\/- N) with an Operation unit (Op) results in Op(N).\n- Combining two Number units (+\/- A, +\/- B) results in A + B.\n- If a combination results in 0, both units are removed, and no new unit is produced.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units (final result 0).\n\nWe need to choose two units to combine for the current turn. Let's consider the options involving the operation unit 'reciprocal' (index 0) and the signed number unit '-1.0' (index 3), as these seem most clearly defined by the rules and examples.\n\nOption 1: Combine Number unit 3 (-1.0) with Operation unit 0 (reciprocal).\n   - The operation 'reciprocal' is applied to the number -1.0.\n   - Result = reciprocal(-1.0) = 1 \/ -1.0 = -1.0.\n   - This consumes units 0 and 3, and produces a new unit -1.0.\n   - New board state would be: 7, 107.9254, -1.0.\n\nOption 2: Combine Number unit 1 (+7) with Operation unit 0 (reciprocal).\n   - Result = reciprocal(7) = 1\/7.\n   - New board state: 1\/7, 107.9254, -1.0.\n\nOption 3: Combine Number unit 2 (+107.9254) with Operation unit 0 (reciprocal).\n   - Result = reciprocal(107.9254) = 1\/107.9254.\n   - New board state: 7, 1\/107.9254, -1.0.\n\nOption 4: Combine Number unit 1 (+7) with Number unit 3 (-1.0).\n   - Result = 7 + (-1.0) = 6.\n   - New board state: reciprocal, 107.9254, 6.\n\nOption 5: Combine Number unit 2 (+107.9254) with Number unit 3 (-1.0).\n   - Result = 107.9254 + (-1.0) = 106.9254.\n   - New board state: reciprocal, 7, 106.9254.\n\nWhile the path to the final objective (result 0) isn't immediately clear from any single move, combining the explicit operation 'reciprocal' (0) with the explicit signed number '-1.0' (3) seems like a direct application of the combination rules inferred from the examples (Number combines with Operation -> Operation applied to Number). The result is reciprocal(-1.0) = -1.0.\n\nLet's choose to combine unit 3 and unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 3 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: 7\nUnit 1: 107.9254\nUnit 2: -1.0\n\nRules Analysis:\n1.  **Combining Units**: Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. This suggests Unit 2 (-1.0) can combine with Unit 0 (7) or Unit 1 (107.9254). It's unclear if unsigned units like 7 and 107.9254 can combine with each other, or if they can initiate combinations. The examples (-10 with *8, -7 with \/3) show a signed number combining with an operator unit, resulting in the operation being applied.\n2.  **Elimination**: Combining a positive number (+N) and a negative number (-N) with the same absolute value (N) results in 0, and the units are eliminated. This implies that when two number units combine, the operation is likely addition\/subtraction based on their signs.\n3.  **Unsigned Numbers**: The simplest interpretation is that unsigned numbers like '7' are treated as positive numbers, so Unit 0 is +7 and Unit 1 is +107.9254.\n4.  **Objective**: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n\nLet's assume unsigned numbers are positive and combination between numbers is addition.\nUnits: +7 (0), +107.9254 (1), -1.0 (2)\n\nPossible combinations:\n*   Combine 0 (+7) and 1 (+107.9254): Result = 7 + 107.9254 = 114.9254.

The operator `\/-1` can negate a number, but consumes both the number and the operator. Operators `*7` and `*-7` could potentially create opposites if applied to the same number, but applying one consumes the number.\n\n**Evaluating Potential First Moves:**\n\n*   **Combine 2 (0.044) and 7 (ceil):** `ceil(0.044) = 1`. This removes a decimal and creates +1. The board becomes: `0(-2), 1(9), 3(sqrt), 4(0.8232), 5(\/-1), 6(*8), 8(square), 9(*-7), 10(*7), New(+1)`. This seems like a reasonable simplifying move.\n*   **Combine 4 (0.8232) and 7 (ceil):** `ceil(0.8232) = 1`. Similar to the above, removes a decimal and creates +1.\n*   **Combine 1 (9) and 3 (sqrt):** `sqrt(9) = 3`. This removes the largest number (9) and the `sqrt` operator, replacing them with a simple integer (3). The board becomes: `0(-2), 2(0.044), 4(0.8232), 5(\/-1), 6(*8), 7(ceil), 8(square), 9(*-7), 10(*7), New(+3)`. This also looks like a strong simplifying move.\n*   **Combine 0 (-2) and 8 (square):** `(-2)^2 = 4`. Creates +4, removing -2 and `square`.\n*   **Combine 0 (-2) and 5 (\/-1):** `-2 \/ -1 = 2`. Creates +2, removing -2 and `\/-1`. This creates the opposite of the original -2, but the original -2 is consumed in the process, preventing immediate cancellation.\n*   **Combine 1 (9) and 5 (\/-1):** `9 \/ -1 = -9`. Creates -9, removing +9 and `\/-1`. Similar issue to the above.\n\nComparing the moves `2 7` (0.044 + ceil -> 1) and `1 3` (9 + sqrt -> 3): Both are good simplifying moves creating integers. Using `sqrt` on the perfect square `9` seems slightly more \"natural\" or \"clean\" in these types of puzzles. It removes the largest number and the unique `sqrt` operator.\n\nLet's choose to combine 1 (+9) and 3 (sqrt).\n\n**Answer Format:** Output the indices separated by a space. The indices are 1 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Okay, I will analyze the board and choose two units to combine according to the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: -2\n1: 0.044\n2: 0.8232\n3: \/-1\n4: *8\n5: ceil\n6: square\n7: *-7\n8: *7\n9: 3.0\n\nRules Recap:\n- Combine (+\/- number) with (* number) or (\/ number): Perform the operation.\n- Combine (+\/- number) with functional operation (ceil, square, etc.): Apply the function to the number. The sign might change based on the function (e.g., square results in positive). `ceil` rounds up.\n- Combine (+X) and (-X): They cancel out, resulting in 0 and removing both units.\n- Goal: Eliminate all units (final result 0).\n\nAnalysis:\nWe want to make moves that simplify the board or create opportunities for cancellation (+X and -X).\nLooking at the units:\n- We have fractional numbers 0.044 (1) and 0.8232 (2).\n- We have the `ceil` operation (5).\n- Combining a fractional number with `ceil` will result in an integer, simplifying the board.\n\nOption 1: Combine 1 (0.044) and 5 (ceil).\n- Unit 1 is +0.044. Unit 5 is `ceil`.\n- Combining them means applying `ceil` to +0.044.\n- ceil(0.044) = 1. The new unit is +1.\n- This removes units 1 and 5 and adds +1. The board becomes simpler.\n\nOption 2: Combine 2 (0.8232) and 5 (ceil).\n- Unit 2 is +0.8232. Unit 5 is `ceil`.\n- Combining them means applying `ceil` to +0.8232.\n- ceil(0.8232) = 1. The new unit is +1.\n- This removes units 2 and 5 and adds +1. The board becomes simpler.\n\nBoth options seem reasonable as a first step. Let's choose Option 1. Combine unit 1 (0.044) and unit 5 (ceil).\n\nSelected indices: 1 and 5.\n\nAnswer: 1 5","1.  **Analyze the board and rules:**\n    *   Board units:\n        *   0: -2 (Number)\n        *   1: 0.8232 (Number, implicitly +0.8232)\n        *   2: \/-1 (Operator: divide by -1)\n        *   3: *8 (Operator: multiply by 8)\n        *   4: square (Operator: square)\n        *   5: *-7 (Operator: multiply by -7)\n        *   6: *7 (Operator: multiply by 7)\n        *   7: 3.0 (Number, implicitly +3.0)\n        *   8: 1 (Number, implicitly +1)\n    *   Rules: Combine a (+\/- number) unit with an operator unit. The operation is applied to the number. The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with 0. Elimination happens when a combination results in 0 (e.g., operating on +X and -X).\n    *   Objective: Find the best pair of units to combine for the current turn towards the goal of 0.\n\n2.  **Evaluate potential combinations:**\n    *   The operators *7 (index 6) and *-7 (index 5) seem like they might be related or intended to cancel somehow.\n    *   Combining a number with an operator modifies the number and removes both units, creating a new number unit.\n    *   Consider using the unit +1 (index 8), as 1 is the multiplicative identity and interacts simply with multipliers.\n    *   Combine +1 (8) with *7 (6): Result is +1 * 7 = +7. This removes units 8 and 6, adds +7. Board state would be [-2, 0.8232, \/-1, *8, square, *-7, 3.0, +7].\n    *   Combine +1 (8) with *-7 (5): Result is +1 * -7 = -7. This removes units 8 and 5, adds -7. Board state would be [-2, 0.8232, \/-1, *8, square, *7, 3.0, -7].\n    *   Both options (8, 6) and (8, 5) use the simple number +1 to eliminate one of the potentially problematic *7 or *-7 operators, replacing them with a simple number (+7 or -7). This seems like a strategically sound move to simplify the board.\n    *   Consider using the operator \/-1 (index 2) to flip signs:\n        *   Combine +3.0 (7) with \/-1 (2): Result is +3.0 \/ -1 = -3.0. Removes 7 and 2, adds -3.0. Leaves [-2, 0.8232, *8, square, *-7, *7, 1, -3.0]. This creates a negative number but doesn't directly cancel anything.\n        *   Combine -2 (0) with \/-1 (2): Result is -2 \/ -1 = +2. Removes 0 and 2, adds +2. Leaves [0.8232, *8, square, *-7, *7, 3.0, 1, +2]. Doesn't seem immediately helpful as it removes the only negative number.\n    *   Comparing the options, using +1 (8) to eliminate either *7 (6) or *-7 (5) seems like a good simplifying step.

This often involves creating pairs of numbers that cancel each other out (+N and -N). Operations can be used to transform existing numbers.\n\n1.  Combining two numbers:\n    *   -2 + 3.0 = 1.0\n    *   -2 + 7 = 5\n    *   3.0 + 7 = 10.0\n    None result in 0 immediately. Interaction with 0.8232 is unclear but likely addition if treated as +0.8232, which doesn't help much now.\n\n2.  Combining a number with an operation:\n    *   Using \/-1 (index 2) seems useful as it negates a number.\n        *   0 (-2) with 2 (\/-1) -> -2 \/ -1 = 2\n        *   6 (3.0) with 2 (\/-1) -> 3.0 \/ -1 = -3.0\n        *   7 (7) with 2 (\/-1) -> 7 \/ -1 = -7\n    *   Using square (index 4):\n        *   0 (-2) with 4 (square) -> (-2)^2 = 4\n    *   Using *8 (index 3):\n        *   7 (7) with 3 (*8) -> 7 * 8 = 56\n    *   Using *-7 (index 5):\n        *   7 (7) with 5 (*-7) -> 7 * -7 = -49\n\n**Move Selection:**\nApplying the \/-1 operation seems like a good candidate for creating potentially useful negative numbers. Combining 7 (+7) with 2 (\/-1) yields -7. This creates a number -7, which relates to the operation *-7 (index 5). This might be useful later (e.g., applying *-7 to the new -7 would yield 49).\n\nLet's choose to combine unit 7 and unit 2.\n\n**Move:** Combine index 7 (+7) and index 2 (\/-1). The result will be 7 \/ -1 = -7.\n\nAnswer: 7 2","Okay, I will analyze the board and suggest a move.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\n*   Index 0: -2 (Signed Number)\n*   Index 1: 0.8232 (Implicitly +0.8232, Signed Number)\n*   Index 2: *8 (Operation)\n*   Index 3: square (Operation)\n*   Index 4: *-7 (Operation)\n*   Index 5: 3.0 (Implicitly +3.0, Signed Number)\n*   Index 6: -7.0 (Signed Number)\n\n**Possible Combinations & Strategy:**\nThe goal is to eliminate all units, ultimately resulting in 0. We need to combine units strategically.\n\n1.  Combine `0: -2` and `2: *8` -> `-16`\n2.  Combine `0: -2` and `4: *-7` -> `14`\n3.  Combine `5: 3.0` and `2: *8` -> `24`\n4.  Combine `5: 3.0` and `4: *-7` -> `-21`\n5.  Combine `6: -7.0` and `2: *8` -> `-56`\n6.  Combine `6: -7.0` and `4: *-7` -> `(-7.0) * (-7) = 49`\n7.  Combine `0: -2` and `3: square` -> `(-2)^2 = 4`\n8.  Combine `5: 3.0` and `3: square` -> `(3.0)^2 = 9`\n9.  Combine `6: -7.0` and `3: square` -> `(-7.0)^2 = 49`\n\nCombining `6: -7.0` with `4: *-7` seems like a good step. It uses the number -7 and the operation involving -7, resulting in `(-7.0) * (-7) = 49`. This simplifies the board by removing two related units.\n\nAnswer: 4 6","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nThe board units are:\n0: -2 (Signed Number)\n1: 0.8232 (Unsigned Number)\n2: *8 (Operation)\n3: square (Operation)\n4: 3.0 (Unsigned Number)\n5: 49.0 (Unsigned Number)\n\nThe rules state:\n1.  Only units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can initiate combinations with other units. In this case, only unit 0 (-2) can initiate a combination.\n2.  \"+number\" represents its value and the addition operation. \"-number\" represents its value and the subtraction operation.\n3.  Based on examples (\"combining -10 with ×8 results in -80\", \"combining -7 with ÷3 yields -2.33...\"), when a signed number (Value V) combines with an operation unit (Operator Op, Operand O like *8, \/3), the result is V Op O. Example: -2 combined with *8 (unit 2) results in -2 * 8 = -16. Example: -2 combined with square (unit 3) results in (-2)^2 = 4.\n4.  When a signed number combines with an unsigned number, the \"+\/- sign represents add\/subtract\". Let's interpret this as:\n    *   Combine +V (unit i) with U (unit j): Result is V + U.\n    *   Combine -V (unit i) with U (unit j): Result is U - V.\n5.  The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0. If a combination results in 0 (like combining +A and -A), the units disappear without producing a new one.\n\nWe must use unit 0 (-2) for the first combination. Let's evaluate the possibilities:\n*   Combine 0 (-2) with 1 (0.8232): Rule U - V. Result = 0.8232 - 2 = -1.1768.\n*   Combine 0 (-2) with 2 (*8): Rule V Op O. Result = -2 * 8 = -16.0.\n*   Combine 0 (-2) with 3 (square): Rule V Op. Result = (-2)^2 = +4.0.\n*   Combine 0 (-2) with 4 (3.0): Rule U - V. Result = 3.0 - 2 = +1.0.\n*   Combine 0 (-2) with 5 (49.0): Rule U - V. Result = 49.0 - 2 = +47.0.\n\nAll these are valid first moves. Without a clear multi-step path to 0 visible immediately, choosing a combination that results in a simple integer value is a reasonable strategy.\n*   Combining 0 and 4 yields +1.0.\n*   Combining 0 and 3 yields +4.0.\n*   Combining 0 and 2 yields -16.0.\n\nCombining 0 and 4 to get +1.0 seems like a good step, as +1.0 is simple to operate with in subsequent steps (e.g., 1*X = X, 1^2 = 1).\n\nTherefore, I will combine unit 0 and unit 4.\n\nAnswer: 0 4","Based on the board state and rules:\n\nBoard:\n0: 0.8232 (interpreted as +0.8232)\n1: *8\n2: square\n3: 49.0 (interpreted as +49.0)\n4: 1.0 (interpreted as +1.0)\n\nRules recap:\n- Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with 0 (presumably by creating pairs of +X and -X which cancel out).\n- Combining +N with 'square' results in +(N^2).\n- Combining +N with '*M' results in +(N*M).\n- Combining +N with +M results in +(N+M) (based on \"+number: ... also represents the addition operation\").\n\nCurrent State Analysis:\nWe have only positive numbers and operators\/functions. To eliminate units, we likely need to create negative numbers or pairs that cancel. No obvious path exists immediately. A reasonable strategy is to simplify the board by performing a combination that either removes an operator\/function or keeps the numbers manageable.\n\nPossible simplifying combinations:\n1.  Combine unit 4 (+1.0) with unit 2 (square): Unit 4 is a signed number, unit 2 is another unit. The combination is applying 'square' to +1.0. Result = +(1.0^2) = +1.0. This replaces units 2 and 4. The new board would be {+0.8232, *8, +49.0, +1.0}. This removes the 'square' operator. The indices combined are 2 and 4.\n2.  Combine unit 4 (+1.0) with unit 1 (*8): Unit 4 is a signed number, unit 1 is another unit. The combination is applying '*8' to +1.0. Result = +(1.0 * 8) = +8.0. This replaces units 1 and 4. The new board would be {+0.8232, square, +49.0, +8.0}. This removes the '*8' operator. The indices combined are 1 and 4.\n\nComparing these options:\nOption 1 removes 'square', which can rapidly increase number size (e.g., with 49.0).\nOption 2 removes '*8'.\nBoth seem reasonable simplifications. Removing the 'square' operator seems slightly preferable to avoid potential large number generation later.\n\nTherefore, I choose to combine unit 2 (square) and unit 4 (+1.0). Following the rule that the signed number combines with the other unit, unit 4 combines with unit 2. The result +1.0 replaces both.\n\nThe indices of the units being combined are 2 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 2 4","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\nBoard Units:\n0: 0.8232\n1: *8\n2: 49.0\n3: 1.0\n\nRules Recap:\n1.  Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units. Example: -10 combined with *8 results in -80. This suggests `signed_number` is an operand and `*8` is an operator.\n2.  Implicitly, numbers like 0.8232, 49.0, 1.0 might be treated as positive numbers (+0.8232, +49.0, +1.0). If so, they fit the category from rule 1.\n3.  Operators include *number, \/number, sqrt, square, etc. Unit 1 (*8) is a multiplication operator.\n4.  The combination rule for two units without signs (+\/-) is incomplete.\n5.  The combination rule for two signed numbers mentions cancellation (+X with -X results in 0), but doesn't explicitly state how to combine two positives or two negatives (though addition seems implied).\n6.  Objective: Eliminate all units, final result is 0. (This might require multiple steps).\n7.  Task: Output the operation for the *current turn* as two indices.\n\nAssuming unsigned numbers are implicitly positive operands:\n0: +0.8232\n1: *8\n2: +49.0\n3: +1.0\n\nBased on rule 1 and the examples, a valid operation is to combine a signed number (operand) with an operator unit.\nPossible combinations of this type:\n*   Combine 0 (+0.8232) with 1 (*8). Indices: `0 1`. Result: +0.8232 * 8 = +6.5856.\n*   Combine 2 (+49.0) with 1 (*8). Indices: `2 1`. Result: +49.0 * 8 = +392.0.\n*   Combine 3 (+1.0) with 1 (*8). Indices: `3 1`. Result: +1.0 * 8 = +8.0.\n\nAny of these seems like a valid move based on the clearest rule interpretation. Let's choose combining 49.0 and *8.\n\nSelected move: Combine unit 2 (+49.0) with unit 1 (*8).\n\nAnswer Format: Two indices separated by a space.\n\nAnswer: 2 1","Based on the rules provided and the current board state:\n1.  **Identify Combinable Units:** The rules state that only units starting with a '+' or '-' sign can combine with other units. The current units are 0.8232, 1.0, and 392.0. None of these explicitly start with a '+' or '-' sign.\n2.  **Interpret Implicit Units:** However, the task requires providing an operation (combining two units). This implies a move must be possible. The most reasonable interpretation is that the numbers on the board are implicitly positive numbers, corresponding to the \"+number\" unit type. So, the board contains +0.8232, +1.0, and +392.0.\n3.  **Determine Operation:** The rule for \"+number\" states it represents both a positive number and the addition operation. When combining two \"+number\" units, the implied operation is addition.\n4.  **Evaluate Possible Moves:**\n    *   Combine 0 (+0.8232) and 1 (+1.0): Result = +1.8232\n    *   Combine 0 (+0.8232) and 2 (+392.0): Result = +392.8232\n    *   Combine 1 (+1.0) and 2 (+392.0): Result = +393.0\n5.  **Assess Goal:** The objective is to reach 0. All possible moves result in a larger positive number, moving further away from the goal. Given the current units (all positive) and the implied addition operation, reaching 0 is impossible without other unit types (like negative numbers or different operations).\n6.  **Select Move:** Since no move progresses towards the goal, any valid combination is acceptable according to the interpretation that a move must be made.

A combination resulting in 0 removes both units.\n    *   Units: We have numbers (1, 6, 7, 8, 9) and operations (0, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n    *   Objective: Find a pair of units to combine that progresses towards the goal of 0.\n\n2.  **Identify potential combinations:**\n    *   Combine signed numbers: e.g., 8 (-9) and 9 (5). The exact rule is slightly ambiguous, but might result in -4.\n    *   Apply operations to numbers: e.g., 9 (5) and 2 (square) -> 25; 8 (-9) and 0 (*4) -> -36; 6 (5.8317) and 3 (floor) -> 5.\n    *   Apply floor to numbers < 1: The rule states that if a combination results in 0, no new unit is produced (eliminating both units).\n        *   Combine 3 (floor) and 1 (0.5528): floor(0.5528) = 0.

This seems like the most efficient first step towards the goal.\n\n4.  **Select the best move:**\n    *   Combining a floor unit (3 or 5) with a unit less than 1 (1 or 7) is the best strategy found, as it eliminates two units immediately.\n    *   Any of the pairs (1, 3), (1, 5), (7, 3), (7, 5) would work.\n    *   Choosing the pair with the lowest indices seems reasonable: units 1 (0.5528) and 3 (floor).\n\n5.  **Format the answer:**\n    *   Provide the indices of the selected units, separated by a space. The indices are 1 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Okay, I will analyze the board and the rules to determine the best move.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe current units are:\n0: *4 (Operation: Multiply by 4)\n1: square (Operation: Square the number)\n2: reciprocal (Operation: Take the reciprocal)\n3: floor (Operation: Round down to the nearest integer)\n4: 5.8317 (Number)\n5: 0.3989 (Number)\n6: -9 (Signed Number, can combine)\n7: 5 (Number)\n8: 0 (Number, potential target state or component)\n\n**Rules and Objective:**\n- Goal: Eliminate all units, resulting in a final combined value of 0.\n- Combinations:\n    - Signed numbers (+\/- N) can combine with other units. Examples show them combining with *\/ operators (e.g., -10 with *8 -> -80).\n    - A positive number (+X) and a negative number (-X) with the same absolute value combine to produce 0 (they cancel each other out).\n    - Functional units (square, reciprocal, floor, etc.) likely operate on number units (signed or unsigned).\n- Elimination: Units are removed when combined. If the result is non-zero, a new unit representing the result is added. If the result is 0 (like +X and -X), no new unit is added.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe main ways to eliminate units are:\n1.  Combine a +X and -X pair. We have -9 (unit 6). We need to create +9.\n2.  Combine units that result in 0.\n3.  Combine units progressively until only 0 remains.\n\nLet's evaluate potential first moves:\n\n1.  **Combine -9 (6) with *4 (0):** -9 * 4 = -36. Replaces units 0 and 6 with -36. We lose the *4 operation and the -9. Now we need +36. Seems complex.\n2.  **Combine square (1) with -9 (6):** (-9)^2 = 81. Replaces units 1 and 6 with 81. We lose the square operation and the crucial -9 unit. This is likely bad if we rely on the +X\/-X cancellation rule.\n3.  **Combine reciprocal (2) with -9 (6):** 1 \/ (-9) = -1\/9. Replaces units 2 and 6 with -1\/9. We keep a negative number, but now need +1\/9. Seems complex.\n4.  **Combine floor (3) with -9 (6):** floor(-9) = -9. Replaces units 3 and 6 with -9. Uses the floor unit but doesn't change the number needed for cancellation. Not efficient.\n5.  **Combine floor (3) with 5.8317 (4):** floor(5.8317) = 5. Replaces units 3 and 4 with 5. Now we have two '5' units (unit 7 and the new one). The utility of this depends on how identical unsigned numbers interact (unknown rule). It doesn't directly help create +9 or eliminate units towards 0.\n6.  **Combine floor (3) with 0.3989 (5):** floor(0.3989) = 0. Replaces units 3 and 5 with 0. This removes two units ('floor' and '0.3989') and creates a '0'. Since the goal is a final result of 0, creating more '0' units or simplifying towards 0 seems like a promising strategy. It gets rid of a fractional number and an operation.\n\nComparing options, move #6 (combining floor (3) and 0.3989 (5)) seems the most strategically sound first step. It simplifies the board by removing two units and creating a 0, aligning with the game's objective without immediately making future cancellations harder (like using up -9 prematurely).\n\n**Chosen Move:**\nCombine unit 3 (floor) and unit 5 (0.3989).\n\nAnswer: 3 5","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nBoard:\n0: *4\n1: square\n2: reciprocal\n3: 5.8317\n4: -9\n5: 5 (Assume this is +5)\n6: 0\n7: 0\n\nRules Recap:\n- +\/- number units can combine with operator units (*, \/, sqrt, square, etc.). Example: -10 with *8 -> -80.\n- +\/- number units can combine with each other (presumed addition).\n- If a combination results in 0 specifically due to operating on +N and -N (e.g., +5 + -5 = 0), both units are removed, and no new unit is produced.\n- Goal: Eliminate all units (empty board or final result 0).\n\nAvailable Combinations & Analysis:\n1.  Combine Operator & Number:\n    - *4 (0) with -9 (4) -> -36\n    - *4 (0) with 5 (5) -> 20\n    - square (1) with -9 (4) -> 81\n    - square (1) with 5 (5) -> 25\n    - reciprocal (2) with -9 (4) -> -1\/9\n    - reciprocal (2) with 5 (5) -> 1\/5\n    - *4 (0), square (1), reciprocal (2) with 5.8317 (3) -> 23.3268, 34.0087..., 0.17147... respectively.\n    - Operations with 0 (6 or 7): *4 -> 0, square -> 0, reciprocal -> undefined.\n2.  Combine +N & -N:\n    - -9 (4) with 5 (5) -> -4\n\nStrategy Considerations:\n- The primary way to eliminate units permanently is by creating a +X and -X pair and combining them.\n- We currently have -9 and +5. Combining them directly gives -4, which doesn't immediately lead to cancellation with other existing numbers.\n- Applying operators like *4 or square to -9 or +5 generates new numbers (e.g., -36, 20, 81, 25), none of which immediately form an opposite pair with existing numbers.\n- The number 5.8317 seems specific. Squaring it (unit 1 + unit 3) yields approx 34. This might simplify the board if intended. 5.8317^2 = 34.0087...\n- The two '0' units are problematic as operations involving them either yield 0 again (potentially just replacing the units) or are undefined (reciprocal). Their elimination path isn't clear from the rules unless a specific interpretation is assumed (e.g., op(0)=0 eliminates both, or 0+0 eliminates both - neither supported by explicit rules).\n\nChoosing the Move:\nCombining -9 (unit 4) and +5 (unit 5) simplifies the board by reducing the number of signed numbers directly. It yields -4. This seems like a reasonable step towards potentially creating pairs later.\n\nMove: Combine unit 4 and unit 5.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules to find the best move.\n\nBoard:\n0: *4\n1: square\n2: reciprocal\n3: 5.8317\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: -4\n\nRules:\n- Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units. (Unit 6: -4 is the only such unit currently).\n- Combining a signed number (like -4) with an operator unit (like *4, square, reciprocal) applies the operation to the number. e.g., -4 combined with *4 results in -16.\n- Combining a signed number with an unsigned number might imply addition\/subtraction (e.g., -4 with 5.8317 -> -4 + 5.8317 = 1.8317).\n- Crucially: \"If the combination of two units results in 0... no new unit is produced\". This means both units are eliminated.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with a combined result of 0.\n\nLet's see what happens when we combine unit 6 (-4) with other units:\n1.  Combine 6 (-4) with 0 (*4): Result is -4 * 4 = -16. Replaces 0 and 6 with -16. Does not eliminate units effectively.\n2.  Combine 6 (-4) with 1 (square): Result is (-4)^2 = 16. Replaces 1 and 6 with +16. Does not eliminate units effectively.\n3.  Combine 6 (-4) with 2 (reciprocal): Result is 1 \/ (-4) = -0.25. Replaces 2 and 6 with -0.25. Does not eliminate units effectively.\n4.  Combine 6 (-4) with 3 (5.8317): Assuming addition, result is -4 + 5.8317 = 1.8317. Replaces 3 and 6 with +1.8317. Does not eliminate units effectively.\n5.  Combine 6 (-4) with 4 (0): How do -4 and 0 combine? If it's addition, -4 + 0 = -4. If it's multiplication, -4 * 0 = 0. Since the rule states that if the combination *results in 0*, both units are eliminated, the multiplication interpretation (-4 * 0 = 0) is the most beneficial and likely intended mechanic for combining with 0. This combination would remove units 6 and 4.\n6.  Combine 6 (-4) with 5 (0): Same as above. -4 * 0 = 0. This combination would remove units 6 and 5.\n\nCombining unit 6 (-4) with either unit 4 (0) or unit 5 (0) results in 0, eliminating both units involved. This is the most efficient step towards the goal of clearing the board. Let's choose to combine unit 6 and unit 4.\n\nAnswer: 6 4","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\n**Board:**\n0: *4\n1: square\n2: reciprocal\n3: 5.8317\n4: 0\n5: -4\n\n**Rules Interpretation:**\n1.  Units like `+number` and `-number` can combine with other units. Based on the format, unit 5 (`-4`) is definitely one such unit. Units 3 (`5.8317`) and 4 (`0`) likely represent `+5.8317` and `+0`, respectively, and can also initiate combinations.\n2.  When a `+\/-number` unit combines with an operator unit (`*`, `\/`, `sqrt`, `square`, `reciprocal`, etc.), the operation is applied to the number. Example: `-4` (unit 5) combined with `square` (unit 1) would result in `(-4)^2 = +16`.\n3.  When two `+\/-number` units combine, it seems they perform addition\/subtraction. The rule `+number` representing addition and `-number` representing subtraction suggests algebraic addition: `(+X)` combined with `(+Y)` yields `+(X+Y)`; `(+X)` combined with `(-Y)` yields `+(X-Y)`; `(-X)` combined with `(-Y)` yields `-(X+Y)`.\n4.  Annihilation Rule: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\". This means combining `+X` and `-X` removes both units.\n5.  Game Objective: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0 (either an empty board or a single `0` unit).\n\n**Analysis of Possible Moves:**\n\nWe need to choose two units to combine for the current turn. The `+\/-number` units are 3 (+5.8317), 4 (+0), and 5 (-4).\n\nConsider combinations involving unit 4 (+0):\n*   Combine 4 (+0) with 0 (*4): Result is `0 * 4 = 0`. This replaces units 4 and 0 with a new `+0` unit. This simplifies the board by removing the operator.\n*   Combine 4 (+0) with 1 (square): Result is `0^2 = 0`. This replaces units 4 and 1 with a new `+0` unit. Also simplifies the board.\n*   Combine 4 (+0) with 2 (reciprocal): Result is `1\/0`, which is undefined\/error. Invalid move.\n*   Combine 4 (+0) with 3 (+5.8317): Result is `0 + 5.8317 = +5.8317`. Replaces units 4 and 3.\n*   Combine 4 (+0) with 5 (-4): Result is `0 + (-4) = -4`. Replaces units 4 and 5.\n\nCombining unit 4 (+0) with an operator like *4 (unit 0) or square (unit 1) seems like a reasonable step to reduce complexity by removing an operator while keeping a 0 on the board. Let's choose to combine unit 4 and unit 0.\n\n**Move:** Combine unit 4 (+0) and unit 0 (*4).\n\nThe indices are 4 and 0.\n\nAnswer: 4 0","Okay, I will analyze the board and rules to determine the best move.\n\n**Board:**\n0: square\n1: reciprocal\n2: 5.8317\n3: -4\n4: 0\n\n**Rules Analysis:**\n1.  Units with signs (+\/-) followed by a number (like unit 3: -4, unit 2: +5.8317, unit 4: +0) can combine with other units.\n2.  Operation units (like unit 0: square, unit 1: reciprocal) must combine with a number unit to be applied.\n3.  Combining an operation unit with a number unit applies the operation to the number. Examples: `-10` with `×8` -> `(-10) * 8 = -80`; `-7` with `÷3` -> `(-7) \/ 3 = -2.33...`.\n4.  Combining `square` (unit 0) with `-4` (unit 3) would result in `(-4)^2 = 16`.\n5.  Combining `square` (unit 0) with `0` (unit 4) would result in `0^2 = 0`.\n6.  Combining `reciprocal` (unit 1) with `-4` (unit 3) would result in `1\/(-4) = -0.25`.\n7.  Combining `reciprocal` (unit 1) with `0` (unit 4) would result in `1\/0`, which is undefined\/invalid.\n8.  The rule states: \"If the combination of two units results in 0... no new unit is produced\". This implies both combined units are eliminated.\n9.  The game objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n\n**Strategic Move:**\nThe goal is to eliminate all units, ending with 0.\nConsider combining unit 0 (`square`) and unit 4 (`0`).\nThe operation is `square` applied to the number `0`.\nThe result is `0^2 = 0`.\nAccording to rule #8, since the result is 0, no new unit is produced, and both combining units (unit 0 and unit 4) are eliminated.\nThis move directly reduces the number of units on the board and utilizes the special rule for a result of 0, progressing towards the game objective. Other combinations produce non-zero results or are invalid.\n\nTherefore, combining unit 0 and unit 4 seems the most logical first step. The indices are 0 and 4.\n\n**Output:**\nProvide the indices of the two units to combine.\n\nAnswer: 0 4","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\n**Board:**\n0: reciprocal (Operation)\n1: 5.8317 (Let's assume this is +5.8317 as per the \"+number\" rule format, a signed number)\n2: -4 (Signed number)\n3: 0 (Number 0)\n\n**Rules:**\n1.  Units with signs (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units. (Units 1 and 2 can initiate combinations).\n2.  Combining a signed number with an operator unit applies the operation to the number (e.g., -4 combined with reciprocal -> reciprocal(-4) = -0.25).\n3.  Combining two signed numbers: The rules state \"+number represents addition\" and \"-number represents subtraction\". This implies the first unit's sign dictates the operation on the second unit (e.g., combine 1 and 2 -> Apply +5.8317 (addition) to -4 -> 5.8317 + (-4) = 1.8317. Combine 2 and 1 -> Apply -4 (subtraction) to 5.8317 -> 5.8317 - 4 = 1.8317).\n4.  Combining with the number 0 (Unit 3): If rule 3 applies, combining 1 and 3 -> 5.8317 + 0 = 5.8317. Combining 2 and 3 -> 0 - 4 = -4. In both cases, the signed number and 0 are replaced by the signed number itself, effectively just removing the 0 unit.\n5.  Elimination Rule: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\". This is the only explicit way to remove units without producing a result.\n6.  Goal: Eliminate all units (final result 0).\n7.  Units without +\/- signs (like reciprocal and potentially 0) likely cannot combine with each other based on the incomplete rule \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\".\n\n**Analysis:**\nTo eliminate units using rule 5, we need a pair like +X and -X. We have -4 (Unit 2). We need +4. Can we make +4 from the other units (+5.8317, reciprocal, 0)?\n- Applying reciprocal to +5.8317 gives ~+0.17148.\n- Applying reciprocal to -4 gives -0.25.\n- Combining +5.8317 and -4 gives +1.8317.\n- Combining with 0 seems to just remove the 0 unit.\nIt doesn't seem possible to create +4 to cancel with -4.\n\nGiven the goal is elimination and the explicit elimination rule seems unreachable currently, we need to perform a valid combination according to the rules. A valid move involves a signed number (Unit 1 or 2) combining with another unit.\n\n**Possible first moves:**\na)  Combine 1 (+5.8317) and 0 (reciprocal): Result reciprocal(5.8317) ≈ +0.17148.

Indices: 2 3.\n\nMoves (d) and (e) just remove the 0 unit, which doesn't seem helpful for the overall goal unless 0 has a special property not described. Moves (a), (b), and (c) transform the board state by creating a new number. Combining a signed number with an operator (moves a, b) is explicitly demonstrated in the rules. Let's choose move (b) as a valid first step.\n\nCombine Unit 2 (-4) with Unit 0 (reciprocal).\n\nAnswer: 2 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: 5.8317\n1: 0\n2: -0.25\n\nRules Summary:\n- Units with signs (+\/- number) can combine with others. Implicitly, 5.8317 is +5.8317. So, units 0 and 2 can combine with others.\n- The combination mechanism isn't perfectly clear, but the examples (-10 with x8 = -80) suggest an operation. However, here we only have numbers.\n- The rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\" strongly suggests that combining two number units involves addition, and if they sum to 0, they cancel out.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, ending with 0.\n\nCurrent state analysis:\nWe have three units: 5.8317, 0, and -0.25.\nLet's assume the combination operation between number units is addition. We need to choose two units to combine.\n\nPossible combinations for this turn:\n1.  Combine Unit 0 (5.8317) and Unit 1 (0): 5.8317 + 0 = 5.8317. The board would become [5.8317, -0.25].\n2.  Combine Unit 0 (5.8317) and Unit 2 (-0.25): 5.8317 + (-0.25) = 5.5817. The board would become [5.5817, 0].\n3.  Combine Unit 1 (0) and Unit 2 (-0.25): 0 + (-0.25) = -0.25. The board would become [5.8317, -0.25].\n\nIn all scenarios, the next step would involve adding the remaining two numbers, leading to a final state of 5.5817. None of the current moves immediately lead to cancellation (summing to 0).\n\nSince no move seems strategically superior in leading towards the goal of 0 under the addition assumption, a reasonable approach is to simplify the board. Combining with the unit '0' (index 1) achieves this by effectively removing the '0' unit. Both combination (0, 1) and (1, 2) involve the '0'.

This removes units 4 and 6 and replaces them with a single unit -10.\n\n**Move Selection:**\nCombining the two identical units -5 (indices 4 and 6) is a reasonable simplifying step. It reduces the number of units on the board by one and keeps the numbers as integers.\n\nLet's choose to combine unit 4 and unit 6.\n\n**Output Format:**\nThe output requires the indices of the two units being combined, separated by a space.\n\nAnswer: 4 6","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\n**Board:**\n0: 21.9259 (Number, likely positive)\n1: *7 (Operator: Multiply by 7)\n2: square (Operator: Square the number)\n3: *9 (Operator: Multiply by 9)\n4: 4 (Number, likely positive +4)\n5: square (Operator: Square the number)\n6: floor (Operator: Round down to nearest integer)\n7: -6 (Number: Negative 6)\n8: -9 (Number: Negative 9)\n9: -10 (Number: Negative 10)\n\n**Rules Interpretation:**\n1.  **Combination:** Units with a sign (+X or -X) can combine with operator units (*Y, \/Y, sqrt, square, etc.). The number acts as the operand for the operator. Example: -10 combines with *8 results in -80. It's likely unsigned numbers like '4' are treated as '+4' and can also combine with operators.\n2.  **Cancellation:** Combining a positive number (+X) and a negative number (-X) with the same absolute value results in 0, and both units are removed without producing a new unit.\n3.  **Goal:** Eliminate all units, reaching a final state of 0.\n\n**Analysis:**\nWe need to perform combinations to simplify the board and eventually cancel everything out. Several initial combinations are possible according to rule 1:\n*   Combine a number with an operator.\n\nLet's consider some potential first moves:\n1.  Combine `0 (21.9259)` with `6 (floor)`: `floor(21.9259) = 21`. This simplifies the non-integer unit. The resulting board would conceptually contain numbers {+21, +4, -6, -9, -10} and operators {*7, square, *9, square}. Interestingly, the sum of these numbers is 21 + 4 - 6 - 9 - 10 = 0. This looks like a promising path. Indices: `0 6`.\n2.  Combine `4 (4)` with `2 (square)`: `4^2 = 16`. Result: +16. Indices: `4 2`.\n3.  Combine `4 (4)` with `3 (*9)`: `4 * 9 = 36`. Result: +36. Indices: `4 3`.\n4.  Combine `8 (-9)` with `2 (square)`: `(-9)^2 = 81`. Result: +81. Indices: `8 2`.\n5.  Combine `8 (-9)` with `3 (*9)`: `-9 * 9 = -81`. Result: -81. Indices: `8 3`.\n\nMove 1 (combining 0 and 6) seems like a good strategic choice because it simplifies the board by removing the non-integer and results in a set of numbers that sum to zero, which might be easier to cancel later.\n\n**Chosen Move:** Combine unit 0 (21.9259) and unit 6 (floor).\n\nAnswer: 0 6","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nBoard:\n0: *7\n1: square\n2: *9\n3: 4\n4: square\n5: -6\n6: -9\n7: -10\n8: 21\n\nRules suggest:\n- Units like *, \/, square, etc., are operators.\n- Units like +N, -N, and plain numbers (4, 21) are operands with values N, -N, 4, 21.\n- Combining an Operator (Op) with an Operand (X) results in Op(X). E.g., square (1) and 4 (3) -> 4^2 = 16. *9 (2) and -10 (7) -> -10 * 9 = -90.\n- Combining two Operands seems to default to addition based on the description of +N\/-N representing add\/subtract. E.g., 4 (3) and 21 (8) -> 4 + 21 = 25. -6 (5) and -9 (6) -> -6 + (-9) = -15. 4 (3) and -10 (7) -> 4 + (-10) = -6.\n- Crucially: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\". This is the elimination mechanism. The goal is to eliminate all units.\n\nWe need to find a sequence of operations eventually leading to 0, meaning all units are eliminated. A key strategy is often to create a number and its opposite (e.g., +X and -X) and then combine them to achieve elimination via the \"results in 0\" rule.\n\nLet's explore a path combining operands:\n1.  Combine unit 8 (21) and unit 5 (-6). Assuming addition: 21 + (-6) = 15.\n    Units remaining: 0:*7, 1:square, 2:*9, 3:4, 4:square, 6:-9, 7:-10, new:15.\n2.  Combine the new 15 and unit 7 (-10). Assuming addition: 15 + (-10) = 5.\n    Units remaining: 0:*7, 1:square, 2:*9, 3:4, 4:square, 6:-9, new:5.\n3.  Combine the new 5 and unit 6 (-9). Assuming addition: 5 + (-9) = -4.\n    Units remaining: 0:*7, 1:square, 2:*9, 3:4, 4:square, new:-4.\n4.  Combine unit 3 (4) and the new -4. Assuming addition: 4 + (-4) = 0. This triggers elimination!\n    Units remaining: 0:*7, 1:square, 2:*9, 4:square.\n\nThis sequence successfully eliminates all number units through a cancellation step. While it leaves operator units (*7, square, *9, square), which poses a question for the final goal (eliminate *all* units), the first step (combining 8 and 5) initiates this effective number-clearing strategy. This seems like a good first move.\n\nLet's choose combining unit 5 and unit 8 for the current turn.\n\nAnswer: 5 8","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules to determine the best move.\n\n**Board:**\n0: *7\n1: square\n2: *9\n3: 4 (which we interpret as +4 based on the rule \"+number: A positive number, which also represents the addition operation.\")\n4: square\n5: -9\n6: -10\n7: 15 (which we interpret as +15)\n\n**Rules:**\n- Signed number units (+N or -N) can combine with other units.\n- Combining a number unit (+\/-N) with an operator unit (Op) results in applying the operation to the number (Op(N)). Example: -10 with *8 results in -80.\n- Combining two number units (+A and +\/-B) seems to result in A + B based on the +\/- representing addition\/subtraction.\n- If a combination results in 0 (like +N and -N), both units are eliminated, and no new unit is produced. This is key to the objective.\n- Objective: Eliminate all units, final result is 0.\n- The rule \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\" is incomplete. To achieve the goal of eliminating all units, we must assume these operator units can somehow be eliminated, possibly by combining with each other.\n\n**Strategy:**\nThe goal is to eliminate all units. The most direct way to eliminate units is to combine a pair +N and -N. We don't have such a pair initially.\nHowever, let's look at the number units: +4 (unit 3), -9 (unit 5), -10 (unit 6), +15 (unit 7).\nNotice that their sum is +4 - 9 - 10 + 15 = 0.\nThis suggests that combining these four number units appropriately will lead to their elimination. Let's assume combining two numbers (+A and +\/-B) results in A+B, replacing the first unit and removing the second, unless the result is 0, where both are removed.\n\n**Possible Path:**\n1.  Combine unit 3 (+4) and unit 5 (-9). Result: +4 + (-9) = -5. The board will have -5 instead of +4, and unit 5 will be removed. Indices: 3 5.\n2.  Combine the new unit 3 (-5) with unit 6 (-10). Result: -5 + (-10) = -15. The board will have -15 instead of -5, and unit 6 will be removed. Indices: 3 6.\n3.  Combine the new unit 3 (-15) with unit 7 (+15). Result: -15 + 15 = 0. Since the result is 0, both units are eliminated. Indices: 3 7.\n4.  At this point, the board only contains operator units: *7, square, *9, square. Assuming the incomplete rule allows operator units to combine and eliminate each other, we can proceed: Combine 0 (*7) and 2 (*9). Indices: 0 2.\n5.  Combine the remaining 1 (square) and 4 (square). Indices: 1 4.\n6.  The board is now empty. Goal achieved.\n\n**First Move:**\nBased on this strategy, a valid first move is to start combining the number units. Combining unit 3 (+4) and unit 5 (-9) is the first step in the path outlined above.\n\nAnswer: 3 5","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\nThe goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\nThe current units are:\n0: *7\n1: square\n2: *9\n3: square\n4: -10\n5: +15 (assuming unsigned number is positive, as per the format description for +number\/-number)\n6: -5\n\nWe have number units (4: -10, 5: +15, 6: -5) and operation units (0: *7, 1: square, 2: *9, 3: square).\nThe rule states that units with a sign (+\/-) can combine with other units.\nCombining a number with an operation applies the operation (e.g., -10 with *7 results in -70).\nCombining two numbers seems to result in their sum (based on the cancellation rule implying +\/- numbers operate together). Let's assume combining +A and +B gives +(A+B), +A and -B gives +(A-B), -A and -B gives -(A+B).\nThe cancellation rule is key: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\". This suggests we want to create a pair like +X and -X.\n\nLet's look at the number units: +15, -10, -5.\nNotice that +15 + (-10) + (-5) = 15 - 10 - 5 = 0.\nThis strongly suggests we should combine these three numbers.\nWe can combine two numbers first. Let's combine -10 (index 4) and -5 (index 6).\nCombining 4 (-10) and 6 (-5) would result in a new unit -15.\nThe board would then conceptually contain: +15, -15, *7, square, *9, square.\nThe next step would be to combine +15 (index 5) and the new -15 unit. According to the cancellation rule, these would combine to 0 and be eliminated, leaving only the operation units.\nWhile the rules about eliminating the remaining operation units (*7, square, *9, square) are unclear due to the incomplete sentence, the most logical first step towards the objective of eliminating units via the cancellation rule is to start combining the numbers.\n\nTherefore, a valid first move is to combine unit 4 (-10) and unit 6 (-5).\n\nAnswer: 4 6","Combine unit 4 (+15) and unit 5 (-15).\nApplying the subtraction operation represented by -15 to +15 gives 15 - 15 = 0.\nAccording to the rules, when the combination results in 0, no new unit is produced, and the two combined units are eliminated.\nThis move eliminates units 4 and 5.\n\nAnswer: 4 5","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\nBoard:\n0: *7\n1: square\n2: *9\n3: square\n\nRules Summary:\n1.  Units starting with '+' or '-' followed by a number (e.g., +5, -10) can combine with other units.\n2.  Examples show a number unit combining with an operator unit results in a new number unit (e.g., -10 combines with *8 -> -80).\n3.  The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n4.  If a combination results in 0 (like +5 and -5), no new unit is produced.\n5.  The behavior of combining two units without +\/- signs is not fully specified, but the examples focus on number units combining with operator units.\n6.  I must output two indices corresponding to the units to combine.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nAll units on the board (*7, square, *9, square) are operator units. None are the \"+\/- number\" type that explicitly initiates combinations according to rule 1. The examples also only show number units combining with operator units.\n\nInference:\nSince a move is required, there must be a way for the current units to combine. The rule might be incomplete, or perhaps operator units *can* combine in some way.\nPossibilities for combining operators:\na)  Combine operators with associated numbers (*7, *9): Maybe *7 and *9 combine into *63 (7*9). (Indices 0 2)\nb)  Combine identical operators (square, square): Maybe they cancel or form a composite operator (x^4)? (Indices 1 3)\nc)  Combine an operator-with-number (*7 or *9) with a functional operator (square): This is ambiguous. It could mean applying the function to the number (e.g., square(7) = 49, resulting in unit +49), or composing the operators.\n\nConsidering the goal is to reach 0 (a number), creating a number unit seems like a necessary step. Option (c), interpreted as applying the function to the constant (e.g., square applied to the 7 in *7), would create a number unit (+49). This aligns with the examples where combinations produce number units. Combining *7 and square (0 and 1) would yield +49. Combining *9 and square (2 and 1, or 2 and 3) would yield +81.\n\nLet's choose the combination that creates a number unit using the lowest indices. Combine unit 0 (*7) and unit 1 (square).

This means the operation (\/3) is applied to the number (-7).\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n- There's an incomplete rule about combining two units without a +\/- sign.\n\nAnalysis:\nCurrently, there are no units with a +\/- sign (+number or -number) on the board. According to the explicit combination rule provided, only signed number units can initiate a combination with other units. Based strictly on this rule, no combination should be possible right now.\n\nHowever, the prompt requires outputting an operation (two indices) for the current turn, implying a move *is* possible. This suggests either the rules are incomplete\/misinterpreted or there's an unstated rule allowing combinations between non-signed units (like operation units).\n\nGiven the ambiguity, let's explore potential combinations of the existing operation units:\n1. Combine *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2). Multiplication operations might combine (e.g., 7 * 9 = 63), perhaps resulting in a *63 unit.\n2. Combine square (index 1) and square (index 3). Squaring operations might combine, perhaps resulting in a ^4 (power of 4) unit.\n3. Combine *7 (index 0) and square (index 1 or 3). It's unclear how these would combine. Squaring the 7 (*49)? Applying *7 after squaring?\n4. Combine *9 (index 2) and square (index 1 or 3). Similar ambiguity. Squaring the 9 (*81)? Applying *9 after squaring?\n\nWithout clarification on how non-signed units combine, combining similar operations seems like a reasonable starting point.

This suggests an unstated rule or interpretation might be in play.\n6.  **Assumption:** If a move must be made, the most plausible action (assuming unstated rules allow combining non-signed units) is to combine similar operations.

This typically requires combining positive and negative number units. Currently, there are no number units (+\/-) on the board, only operator units. The rules state that signed number units can combine with other units. The rule about combining two units without signs is incomplete in the prompt, but typically operators might combine with each other (like function composition or simplifying operations) or require a number to act upon.\n\nSince no signed numbers are present, we cannot perform the standard combination described (e.g., -10 with *8). However, I must provide a move for the current turn. A plausible interpretation is that operators can be combined.\n\nPossible combinations of operators:\n1.  Combine *7 (0) and *9 (2): This could result in a single *63 operator. This seems like a direct combination of similar operators.\n2.  Combine square (1) and square (3): This could result in a single power(4) operator.\n3.  Combine *7 (0) with square (1 or 3): The order matters (multiply then square, or square then multiply), making it potentially ambiguous.\n4.  Combine *9 (2) with square (1 or 3): Similar ambiguity.\n\nCombining the two multiplication operators (*7 and *9) seems like the most straightforward and unambiguous combination available on the board. Let's combine unit 0 and unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  Units that can combine with others are those starting with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number.\n2.

This implies either the rules are incomplete or there's an intended interpretation not explicitly covered. If we must make a move, we have to assume some interaction is possible between non-signed units. A plausible interaction might be the composition of operations:\n- Combining *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2) could result in *63.\n- Combining square (index 1) and square (index 3) could result in ^4 (power 4).\n\nCombining the two multiplication operations (0 and 2) seems like a reasonable action if operations can indeed be composed.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units (operators like *, \/, sqrt, square, etc.). Examples: -10 combined with *8 gives -80.\n2.  The rule regarding the combination of two units without a + or - sign is incomplete, but the examples and the first rule strongly suggest that combinations require a number unit (+N or -N) and an operator unit.\n3.  The current board contains only operator units: 0 (*7), 1 (square), 2 (*9), 3 (square).\n4.

Currently, there are no such number units on the board. To progress, we must combine existing units.\n\nGiven the units *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2), a plausible interpretation of combining them is functional composition, resulting in a single multiplication operation *63. Combining two 'square' operations might result in a power of 4 operation. Combining a multiplication and a square operation is less clear.\n\nCombining the two multiplication units seems like a reasonable step under the assumption of composition.

The required output format \"Answer: index1 index2\" forces a move selection.\n\nGiven the constraint that a move must be outputted in the specified format, and the lack of applicable explicit rules, I must make an assumption about how operations might combine, possibly based on the incomplete rule.

Example: +X and -X operated cancel out.\n- The rule for combining two units without +\/- signs is incomplete.\n- Other operations: square, sqrt, reciprocal, floor, ceil.\n\nCurrent Situation:\nAll units on the board are operations (*7, square, *9, square). None are signed numbers. According to the explicit rule, only signed numbers can initiate combinations with other units. The rule for combining units without signs (like two operations) is not fully specified.\n\nHowever, the game requires making a move.

They don't explicitly state whether other unit types (like operations) can combine amongst themselves, especially given the incomplete sentence \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\". However, the task requires providing an operation (combining two units). This implies that some combination must be possible.\n\nWithout numbers (+\/-) on the board, achieving the goal of 0 is currently impossible.

This typically happens when +X and -X combine.\n- The rule for combining two units without a +\/- sign is incomplete.\n\nAnalysis:\nThe board currently contains only operation units: *7, square, *9, square. There are no +number or -number units. According to the rule \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units\", it seems no unit on the board can initiate a combination.\n\nHowever, games usually allow for moves. Let's assume there's a way for the existing units to combine. A plausible interpretation, mirroring the example where -10 combines with *8, is that an operation unit (like `square`) can combine with an operation unit containing a value (like `*N`) by applying the operation to the value.\n\nPossible combinations under this assumption:\n1. Combine `1 (square)` and `0 (*7)`: Apply `square` to `7`. Result might be `+49`.\n2. Combine `1 (square)` and `2 (*9)`: Apply `square` to `9`. Result might be `+81`.\n3. Combine `3 (square)` and `0 (*7)`: Apply `square` to `7`. Result might be `+49`.\n4. Combine `3 (square)` and `2 (*9)`: Apply `square` to `9`. Result might be `+81`.\n5. Combine `0 (*7)` and `2 (*9)`: Combine multiplication operations. Result might be `*63`.\n6. Combine `1 (square)` and `3 (square)`: Combine square operations. Result might be `^4` (power of 4).\n\nTo progress towards the goal of eliminating units (which requires +\/- numbers), creating a number unit seems necessary. Options 1-4 achieve this. Let's choose the combination involving the lowest indices, which is combining unit 1 (`square`) and unit 0 (`*7`).\n\nMove: Combine unit 1 and unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  Units are: 0: *7, 1: square, 2: *9, 3: square.\n2.  The primary combination rule described involves a unit with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number combining with another unit. Examples: -10 with *8, -7 with \/3.\n3.  The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0. Elimination is explicitly mentioned when a combination results in 0 (e.g., combining +X and -X).\n4.  The current board contains only operator units (*7, square, *9, square). There are no +\/- number units.\n5.  Therefore, the primary combination rule cannot be applied directly as there are no +\/- number units to initiate the combination described.\n6.  There's an incomplete rule mentioning \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\". This might describe how operators combine, but the rule is cut off.\n7.  The task requires outputting two indices for a combination *this turn*. This implies a move must be possible.\n8.  Assuming operators *can* combine, a plausible interpretation is functional composition or simplification:\n    *   Combining *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2) could result in *63.\n    *   Combining square (index 1) and square (index 3) could result in power(4).\n9.  Neither move obviously leads towards the goal of 0 given the lack of number units. However, combining the two multiplication operators seems like a reasonable simplification step.

The goal is to eliminate all units resulting in 0, which is explicitly linked to combining positive and negative numbers of equal absolute value.\n3.  **Identify Possible Moves:** According to the strict rules, there are no units with a +\/- sign followed by a number on the board. Therefore, no combinations should be possible based *only* on the explicit rule provided.\n4.  **Address Ambiguity\/Incompleteness:** The prompt requires providing a move for the current turn, suggesting that combinations must be possible even without +\/- number units. The rule describing what happens \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\" is cut off, leaving ambiguity. A common pattern in such games is that either:\n    *   Identical operations might cancel each other out (e.g., square and square).\n    *   Similar operations might compose (e.g., *7 and *9 might combine into *63).\n5.  **Choose a Move:** Since a move must be made, let's explore potential combinations assuming operations can interact:\n    *   **Option 1: Combine identical operations.** Combine 1 (square) and 3 (square). If they cancel, the board becomes *7, *9.\n    *   **Option 2: Combine similar operations.** Combine 0 (*7) and 2 (*9). If they compose multiplicatively (7 * 9 = 63), the board becomes *63, square, square.\n    *   Neither path clearly leads to the objective of 0 based on the current information.

Therefore, according to the explicit rules, no combination can be initiated in this turn.\n\nHowever, the prompt requires outputting two unit indices, implying a move must be made. This suggests there might be an unstated rule or convention for combining operation units. Without explicit rules for combining two operation units, a plausible action is to combine units of the same type. There are two multipliers (*7 and *9) and two squares (square and square). Combining the two multipliers seems like a reasonable guess.

The examples show these signed numbers acting as values that are operated upon by other units (e.g., -10 combined with *8 results in -80).\nThe current units (*7, square, *9, square) are operations, not signed numbers. The rule describing how units without a sign combine is incomplete (\"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\").\n\nHowever, the prompt requires making a move for the current turn.

This suggests there might be an unstated rule or interpretation for combining units that are purely operational when no +\/- units are present.\n5.  **Assumption:** Given the need to make a move, let's assume similar operation units can be combined. We have two multiplication units (`*7`, `*9`) and two square units (`square`, `square`).\n6.  **Possible Moves:**\n    *   Combine `*7` (0) and `*9` (2). This could result in `*63`.\n    *   Combine `square` (1) and `square` (3). This could result in applying the square operation twice (i.e., raising to the power of 4).\n7.  **Choice:** Combining the two multiplication operations seems like a reasonable first step to simplify the board. Let's combine unit 0 (`*7`) and unit 2 (`*9`).\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  Units are:\n    *   0: *7 (Multiplication by 7)\n    *   1: square (Square operation, x -> x^2)\n    *   2: *9 (Multiplication by 9)\n    *   3: square (Square operation, x -> x^2)\n2.  The core rule for combination states: \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\"\n3.  The examples show a signed number combining with an operator (e.g., -10 combined with *8 results in -80).\n4.  There are currently no units on the board that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number. All units are operators (*7, square, *9, square).\n5.  According to the primary combination rule, no combinations are possible with the current units. The operators (*, \/, sqrt, square, etc.) need a number unit (+N or -N) to act upon or combine with.\n6.  However, the task requires outputting an operation by providing two unit indices. This implies that a move must be possible, suggesting either the rules are incomplete or there's an exception.\n7.  The rule \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\" is incomplete in the prompt, but might have intended to describe how operators combine.\n8.  Without explicit rules for operator combination, we must speculate. A common behavior in such games is that identical or inverse units might cancel each other out or combine in a specific way.\n9.  We have two identical units: 1 (square) and 3 (square). Combining them is a plausible speculative move. If identical operators cancel each other out, this move would reduce the number of units on the board. Another possibility is combining the two multiplication operators 0 (*7) and 2 (*9), perhaps resulting in *63.\n10. Given the objective is to eliminate all units (reaching 0), cancellation seems like a potentially useful mechanism. Combining the two identical 'square' units (1 and 3) is the most reasonable guess under the assumption that operators can combine and identical ones might cancel.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Based on the rules provided, units with a +\/- sign followed by a number are the primary units that initiate combinations with other units (like *M, \/M, sqrt, etc.). The current board contains only operator units: *7, square, *9, square.

However, the prompt requires an operation for the current turn. This implies that either:\n1.  There's an unstated rule allowing operator units to combine.\n2.  The game state is technically stuck, but a move must be made.\n\nAssuming operators can combine, the most logical combination is merging the two multiplication operators. Combining *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2) could result in a single *63 unit. This seems like a possible interpretation that allows progress, even if the ultimate goal of reaching 0 is not immediately achievable from this state.\n\nLet's combine unit 0 and unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules and board state:\n1.  **Identify Unit Types:**\n    *   Unit 0: `*7` (Multiplication operator with value 7)\n    *   Unit 1: `square` (Square operation)\n    *   Unit 2: `*9` (Multiplication operator with value 9)\n    *   Unit 3: `square` (Square operation)\n2.  **Analyze Combination Rules:**\n    *   The primary rule states: \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\"\n    *   Examples show signed numbers combining with operators (e.g., -10 with *8).\n    *   There's an incomplete rule: \"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\"\n    *   Currently, none of the units (`*7`, `square`, `*9`, `square`) start with a '+' or '-' sign followed by a number.\n3.  **Interpret Ambiguity:**\n    *   Strictly following the main rule, no combination seems possible as there are no \"+number\" or \"-number\" units.\n    *   However, the prompt requires outputting a move (two indices), implying a combination must be possible.\n    *   A plausible interpretation, given the need for a move, is that operator units like `square` can interact with the number part of other operator units like `*7`. For instance, combining `square` (1) and `*7` (0) could mean applying the square operation to the number 7, potentially resulting in a new unit like `+49`.\n4.  **Choose a Move:**\n    *   Assuming the interpretation in step 3 is allowed:\n        *   Combining 0 (`*7`) and 1 (`square`) could yield `+49`.\n        *   Combining 2 (`*9`) and 3 (`square`) could yield `+81`.\n        *   Combining 0 (`*7`) and 3 (`square`) could yield `+49`.\n        *   Combining 2 (`*9`) and 1 (`square`) could yield `+81`.\n    *   Any of these pairs represents a possible first move under this interpretation. Choosing the pair with the lowest indices is a common convention. Let's combine unit 0 and unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Based on the rules provided, units with signs (+ or -) are combined with other units. For example, a number like -10 combines with an operation like *8 to produce a new number -80. The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.

This implies a move is possible. Let's explore potential interpretations if operations can combine:\n1.  Combine *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2): This could possibly result in a combined multiplication operation, *63.\n2.  Combine square (index 1) and square (index 3): This might result in a combined power_4 operation.\n3.  Combine a multiplication and a square (e.g., 0 and 1): The outcome is highly ambiguous based on the rules given (apply square to 7? get 49? get *49? compose operations?).\n\nAssuming the combination of similar operations is the intended mechanic for non-signed units:\n- Combining 0 (*7) and 2 (*9) yields *63. The board becomes [*63, square, square].\n- Combining 1 (square) and 3 (square) yields power_4. The board becomes [*7, *9, power_4].\n\nNeither path clearly leads to the goal of 0 without further numbers or rules. However, combining the two multiplication operations (*7 and *9) appears to be a plausible interpretation if combining operations is allowed.\n\nLet's choose to combine the two multiplication units.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  **Combination Rule:** \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\" This implies that one of the units involved in a combination must be a signed number (e.g., +5, -10).\n2.  **Current Board:** The units are [0: *7, 1: square, 2: *9, 3: square]. None of these are signed number units.\n3.  **Problem:** According to the primary combination rule, no combination is possible because there are no signed number units on the board. The rule about combining units without signs is incomplete in the prompt (\"if two units that do not contain a + or - sign…\").\n4.  **Assumption:** Since the task requires providing a move (two indices), we must assume that either the rules are incomplete and combinations between non-signed units are allowed, or there's another interpretation. A common way operations combine is through composition. Combining two multiplication operations (*7 and *9) results in a composite multiplication (*63). This seems like a plausible interpretation if a move must be made. Combining the two 'square' operations is another possibility, perhaps resulting in a 'power 4' operation. Combining a multiplication and a square is also possible, but the order would matter and isn't specified.\n5.  **Chosen Move:** Combining the two multiplication units seems the most straightforward composition.

Combining *7 and *9 into *63, or square and square into power_of_4, changes the operators but doesn't eliminate units directly.\n    *   A plausible interpretation of the missing rule, especially aiming for elimination, is that combining two identical operator units might cause them to be removed or simplified. The board has two identical `square` units at indices 1 and 3. Combining them is a reasonable move towards simplification or elimination.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Combining the two `square` units seems the most logical step given the objective and the presence of identical units, assuming a reasonable completion of the missing rule.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Based on the provided rules, units that can initiate a combination must be signed numbers (+number or -number).

This suggests either the rule is not exclusive, or the incomplete rule allows for combining operator units.\n\nAssuming operator units can combine, a common game mechanic is to combine similar or identical units.\nWe have two pairs of similar units:\n-   `*7` (index 0) and `*9` (index 2) - both are multiplication operators.\n-   `square` (index 1) and `square` (index 3) - both are square operators (identical).\n\nCombining similar units often results in a simplified or composite unit.\n-   Combining `*7` and `*9` would likely result in `*63` (7 * 9 = 63).\n-   Combining `square` and `square` could result in `power4` (applying the operation twice), or perhaps they cancel out if identical units are removed upon combination (though the rules only explicitly mention cancellation for +X and -X).\n\nWithout the complete rule for combining non +\/- units, I'll make a plausible move based on combining similar types. Combining the two multiplication units seems like a standard simplification.\n\n**Chosen Move:**\nCombine unit 0 (`*7`) and unit 2 (`*9`).\n\n**Output Format:**\nThe output should be the two indices separated by a space.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","Based on the rules provided, combinations primarily involve units starting with a '+' or '-' sign followed by a number.

If we assume that operation units *can* combine, combining the two multiplication operations (*7 and *9) seems like a plausible, albeit undefined by the rules, action.

However, the current board *only* contains operation units (*7, square, *9, square). There are no signed number units (+number or -number).\nBased *only* on the explicit examples, no combination seems possible, as there are no signed numbers to initiate the combination as shown (-10 with *8, etc.).\nHowever, the prompt asks for a move (a pair of indices), implying that a combination *is* possible. This suggests there are unstated rules, possibly related to the incomplete sentence about combining units without signs.\n\nAssuming operations *can* combine:\n1.  Combine Multiplications: Units *7 (index 0) and *9 (index 2) are both multiplication operations. It's mathematically intuitive to combine them into a single multiplication operation *63 (*(7*9)).\n2.  Combine Squares: Units square (index 1) and square (index 3) could potentially combine. Applying square to square results in raising to the power of 4 (x^2)^2 = x^4.\n3.  Combine Multiplication and Square: Combining *7 (index 0) and square (index 1) is less clear. Does it become *(7^2)=*49? Or 7*(x^2)? Or (7x)^2? The rules don't specify this interaction.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, combining the two multiplication units (*7 and *9) seems the most straightforward and mathematically standard interpretation of combining operations of the same type.

Combine the number (110.1852) with an operation (assuming this is allowed, perhaps the number is implicitly positive or the rule about +\/- signs applies differently):\n    *   3 (110.1852) with 1 (floor): floor(110.1852) = 110.

What about combining the negatives first?\n1. Board: -7(0), floor(1), sqrt(2), 110.1852(3), -10(4)\n2. Combine 0 and 4 -> (-7) + (-10) = -17. Board: floor(1), sqrt(2), 110.1852(3), -17(new_0)\n3.

However, the most likely intended first step involves processing the non-standard number 110.1852. Applying sqrt seems the most promising path as floor(sqrt(110.1852)) yields 10, which can potentially cancel -10.\n\nLet's choose combining 3 (110.1852) and 2 (sqrt).\n\nAnswer: 3 2","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\n0: -7\n1: floor\n2: -10\n3: 10.496913832169911\n\nRules Summary:\n- Units with signs (+\/- number) can combine with other units (operators like floor, *number, etc.).\n- The combination applies the operation. e.g., combining -7 with floor results in floor(-7) = -7. Combining floor with 10.49... results in floor(10.49...) = 10.\n- Combining units resulting in 0 eliminates them (e.g., +X and -X).\n- Objective: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n\nPossible combinations for the current turn:\n1.  Combine `floor` (1) with `-7` (0): floor(-7) = -7. The board would become: -7, -10, 10.49.... This simplifies by removing `floor` but doesn't change numeric values significantly.\n2.  Combine `floor` (1) with `-10` (2): floor(-10) = -10. The board would become: -7, -10, 10.49.... Similar to the above.\n3.  Combine `floor` (1) with `10.49...` (3): floor(10.49...) = 10. Let's assume this result becomes a unit '+10'. The board would become: -7, -10, +10. This is a promising step because now -10 and +10 can cancel each other out.\n4.  Combine `-7` (0) with `-10` (2): Assuming this implies addition, -7 + (-10) = -17. The board would become: -17, floor, 10.49....\n5.  Combine `-7` (0) with `10.49...` (3): Assuming this implies addition (-7 + 10.49...), result is 3.49.... Board: floor, -10, 3.49....\n6.  Combine `-10` (2) with `10.49...` (3): Assuming this implies addition (-10 + 10.49...), result is 0.49.... Board: -7, floor, 0.49....\n\nComparing the options, combining `floor` (1) with `10.49...` (3) seems the most strategically sound move. It removes the `floor` operator and converts the non-integer number into an integer (10). This resulting +10 can then be combined with the existing -10 unit to eliminate both in the next step, simplifying the board significantly towards the goal of reaching 0.\n\nTherefore, the operation for the current turn is combining unit 1 and unit 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","Okay, I will analyze the game state and rules to determine the best operation for the current turn.\n\n**Game Rules Analysis:**\n1.  **Units:** We have signed numbers (+\/- number) and potentially operator units (*number, \/number, sqrt, etc.). In this specific board, we only have signed numbers: -7 (index 0), -10 (index 1), and 10 (index 2).\n2.  **Combination:** Signed number units can combine with other units.\n3.  **Zero Result Rule:** Combining a positive number (+X) and a negative number (-X) with equal absolute values results in 0, and *no new unit is produced*. This means both units are eliminated from the board. This appears to be the primary mechanism for removing units permanently.\n4.  **Other Combinations:** Examples show signed numbers combining with operators (like -10 with *8 yielding -80). It's also implied signed numbers might combine via addition\/subtraction (e.g., -7 + 10 = 3), resulting in a new unit replacing the combined ones.\n5.  **Objective:** Eliminate *all* units, meaning the final combined result is 0 (an empty board).\n\n**Current Board:**\n*   Index 0: -7\n*   Index 1: -10\n*   Index 2: 10\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe objective is to eliminate all units. The Zero Result Rule is the only described mechanism that explicitly removes units without creating a new one. We have unit 1 (-10) and unit 2 (10). These units have equal absolute values (10) and opposite signs. According to the Zero Result Rule, combining them will result in 0, and both units will be eliminated.\n\nCombining units 1 and 2:\n*   Units -10 (index 1) and 10 (index 2) are combined.\n*   Result: 0. No new unit is created. Units 1 and 2 are removed.\n*   Remaining units: -7 (index 0).\n\nWhile this move doesn't immediately win the game (as -7 remains), it is the only move available that utilizes the specific elimination rule provided. Any other combination (like -7 and -10, or -7 and 10) would likely result in a new unit (-17 or 3, respectively), not elimination. Therefore, combining 1 and 2 is the most logical step towards the objective in the current turn based on the provided rules.\n\n**Output:**\nThe operation involves combining unit 1 and unit 2. The required format is the indices separated by a space.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Based on the board and rules:\n1.  The board contains a single unit: -7 at index 0.\n2.  The rules state that combining requires two units. Examples show combining a signed number with an operator or potentially two signed numbers (to get 0).\n3.  The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n4.  With only one unit (-7), there are no other units to combine it with according to a strict reading of \"combine with other units\".\n5.  However, the prompt requires outputting two indices, implying a move must be made.\n6.  If we allow combining a unit with itself (index 0 with index 0), and interpret the combination of the unit '-7' (representing subtraction) with itself as applying its operation to its value, one possible interpretation is -7 - (-7) = 0. This would eliminate the unit and achieve the game objective. While rules about self-combination and combining two signed numbers are not perfectly clear, this is a plausible interpretation that allows following the output format requirement.\n\nTherefore, the proposed operation is combining unit 0 with unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board state and rules:\n1.  The board contains a single unit at index 0: -7.\n2.  The rules state that units with a sign (+\/-) can combine with *other* units.\n3.  The objective is to combine units such that the final result is 0, eliminating all units. The primary way described to eliminate units is combining a positive and negative number with equal absolute values (e.g., +X and -X), which results in 0.\n4.  With only one unit (-7) on the board, there are no *other* units to combine it with.\n5.  Specifically, there is no corresponding +7 unit to combine with -7 to achieve the elimination goal of 0.\n6.  Furthermore, there are no operation units (*, \/, sqrt, etc.) to combine with -7 according to the examples provided (e.g., combining -10 with ×8).\n7.  Therefore, according to the rules as stated (\"combine with other units\"), no valid move seems possible from this board state.\n8.  However, the required output format is strictly \"Answer: index1 index2\", implying a move involving two unit indices must be specified.\n9.  Since the only available index is 0, the only response that fits the required format is \"0 0\". This implies combining the unit at index 0 with itself. While this contradicts the \"other units\" phrasing and doesn't lead towards the objective based on the provided combination rules (combining -7 with -7 wouldn't result in 0 elimination), it is the sole syntactically valid response given the constraint on the output format.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the rules and the current board state:\n1.  **Board State:** There is only one unit on the board:\n    *   Index 0: -7\n2.  **Game Objective:** Eliminate all units, resulting in a final state of 0.\n3.  **Rules for Combining:**\n    *   Units with a sign (+ or -) can combine with other units.\n    *   A unit `-number` represents a negative number and also the subtraction operation.\n    *   If a combination results in 0, no new unit is produced, effectively removing the combined units.\n4.  **Required Action:** Output the operation for the current turn by providing two corresponding unit indices.\n5.  **Analysis:**\n    *   To perform an operation, two unit indices must be selected.\n    *   There is only one unit (index 0).\n    *   The requirement to output two indices implies a move must be specified.

The board contains only one unit: -7 at index 0.\n2.  The rules state that units with a sign (+\/-) can combine with *other* units.\n3.  To perform an operation, two unit indices must be provided.\n4.  Since there is only one unit on the board (at index 0), there are no \"other\" units to combine it with. Therefore, according to the rules, no valid combination operation can be performed this turn.\n5.  However, the output format strictly requires providing two unit indices. Given this constraint and the lack of valid moves, the only possible indices that can be referenced belong to the existing unit (index 0). Although combining a unit with itself might contradict the \"other units\" rule, providing \"0 0\" is the only way to syntactically fulfill the output requirement using the available index.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, let's analyze the game state and rules.\n\nBoard: `0 -7`\nThis notation most likely represents the units currently on the board. Let's assume these are the units, indexed starting from 0:\nUnit 0: 0\nUnit 1: -7\n\nRules:\n- Units like `+number` and `-number` can combine with other units.\n- `+number` represents addition, `-number` represents subtraction.\n- Goal: Combine units until the result is 0, eliminating all units.\n- Task: Output the indices of two units to combine for the current turn.\n\nCurrent State:\nWe have two units: Unit 0 (value 0) and Unit 1 (value -7).\nIndices available: 0 and 1.\n\nTo make a move, we need to select two unit indices to combine. The only possible pair is 0 and 1.\n\nLet's consider the combination: Combine Unit 0 and Unit 1.\nAccording to the rules, `-number` units (like Unit 1: -7) can combine with others and represent subtraction. Let's assume -7 acts as the subtraction operation applied to the other unit (0).\nCombine(Unit 0, Unit 1) -> Combine(0, -7). If -7 is the operation: 0 - 7 = -7.\nThe two units (0 and -7) would be replaced by a single unit (-7). This move doesn't achieve the goal of 0 immediately, but it is the only possible move given the state and the requirement to combine two units.\n\nThe task asks for the operation for the current turn, which means providing the indices of the two units to be combined. Based on the interpretation that the board lists the units [0, -7], the indices are 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Based on the rules and the current board state:\n1.  **Board State:** There is only one unit on the board, which is -7 at index 0.\n2.  **Game Objective:** Eliminate all units, resulting in a final combined value of 0.\n3.  **Combination Rule:** Combinations require two units. Typically, a +\/- number unit acts as the operand, and another unit acts as the operator. A combination resulting in 0 removes both units. Other combinations replace the two units with the resulting single unit.\n4.  **Current Situation:** With only one unit (-7), it is impossible to select two distinct units to combine according to the standard interpretation of the rules. The rules provided don't explicitly cover combining a unit with itself, nor do they specify what to do when only one unit remains and it's not 0.\n5.  **Output Requirement:** The response must be in the format 'Answer: i j', providing the indices of the two units to combine.\n6.  **Dilemma:** No valid combination of two units is possible. However, the output format demands two indices. The only available index is 0. Therefore, the only possible response respecting the format structure is \"0 0\". This might represent an attempt to combine the unit with itself, potentially resulting in -7 - 7 = -14 (if -7 acts as both operand and subtraction operator), or it might be interpreted as an indication that no valid move exists. Given the constraints, providing \"0 0\" is the only way to satisfy the output format.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the rules and the board provided:\n\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The board is `0 -7`. Assuming this lists the units separated by spaces, we have two units:\n    *   Unit at index 0: `0`\n    *   Unit at index 1: `-7`\n2.  **Analyze the units:**\n    *   Unit `0`: This could be interpreted as just the number 0, or potentially `+0`. The rules state units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units. If `0` is treated as `+0`, it fits this category.\n    *   Unit `-7`: This is a signed number (`-` sign followed by the number 7) and fits the category of units that can combine.\n3.  **Determine possible combinations:** Since we have two units, and at least one (`-7`, possibly both if `0` is `+0`) can initiate combination, we can combine them. The only possible move is to combine unit 0 and unit 1.\n4.  **Determine the operation:** The rules don't explicitly state how two signed numbers combine, only how a signed number combines with an operator unit (like `*` or `\/`). However, the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\" strongly implies an addition\/subtraction context for combining two signed numbers. Let's assume addition is the standard operation when combining two such units.\n5.  **Calculate the result (optional for the current task):** If we combine `0` (as `+0`) and `-7` using addition: `0 + (-7) = -7`. The result would be a new unit `-7`. This move does not achieve the objective of eliminating all units to reach 0 in this turn, but the task is to provide the operation for the *current turn*.\n6.  **Format the output:** The task requires outputting the indices of the two units being combined, separated by a space.

This implies cancellation is possible.\n- Output: Provide two unit indices for the combination.\n\nCurrent State:\nThere is only one unit, -7, at index 0. The rules state a unit combines with \"other\" units, and the output requires *two* indices. This usually implies two *different* units.

(-7) + (-7) = -14. Doesn't eliminate the unit.\n- Option 2: Using the unit's inherent operation (- for -7) on its value. Maybe -7 - (-7) = 0? This would eliminate the unit and achieve the goal. This interpretation aligns with the goal of elimination, where operations might lead to zero. If we had +7 instead, combining it with itself might mean +7 - (+7) = 0.\n\nLet's assume combining a signed unit with itself means subtracting its value from itself, resulting in 0 and eliminating the unit.\n\nMove: Combine unit 0 with unit 0.\nIndices: 0 0\nResult: -7 - (-7) = 0.

The rules are a bit ambiguous about self-combination. However, the rules state:\n1.  Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n2.  If the combination results in 0, no new unit is produced. This happens specifically \"when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on\". This suggests an operation like addition (`+X + -X = 0`).\n3.  The objective is to eliminate all units, reaching 0.\n\nIf we combine `-7` with `-7` (indices 0 0), what operation should be applied?\n- If we follow the pattern of the zero rule (implicitly addition): `-7 + (-7) = -14`. This doesn't eliminate the unit; it replaces it with `-14`.\n- The rule for units like `-number` states it's \"A negative number, which also represents the subtraction operation.\" If combining the unit with itself implies using its own operation on its own value, it could mean `-7 - (-7) = 0`.\n\nGiven the objective is to eliminate all units and reach 0, the interpretation `-7 - (-7) = 0` aligns best with the goal. If the combination results in 0, the rule states \"no new unit is produced,\" effectively eliminating the unit `-7`. This empties the board and achieves the objective.\n\nTherefore, the action is to combine unit 0 with unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board state and the rules:\n1.  The board contains only one unit: `-7` at index `0`.\n2.  The game requires combining two units to perform an operation.\n3.  The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n4.  The available unit types include signed numbers (`+number`, `-number`) and various operations.\n5.  The rule for combining two signed number units states that if a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on, the result is 0 (e.g., +5 and -5 combine to 0), which suggests addition is the default operation (+5 + -5 = 0).\n6.  With only one unit (`-7`), it's impossible to select two *different* units to combine.\n7.  The prompt requires outputting two indices for the current turn's operation. The only syntactically possible output given the single unit at index 0 is \"0 0\".\n8.  This implies that either a unit can be combined with itself, or the game state provided is unusual\/unsolvable under standard rules.\n9.  If combining unit 0 with itself (\"0 0\") is the intended move, it must lead towards the objective. For `-7` combined with `-7` to result in elimination (0), the operation would need to be subtraction (`-7 - (-7) = 0`). This contradicts the implication from the rule about combining opposite signed numbers (which suggested addition). However, given the constraint to provide a move, combining the unit with itself is the only possibility.\n\nTherefore, assuming a move must be made and the only possibility is combining the unit with itself, the indices are 0 and 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the rules provided:\n1.  The board contains units identified by an index. The input `board: \\n0 -7` indicates there is one unit at index 0, and its value\/type is `-7`.\n2.  A move consists of combining two units, specified by their indices. Examples show combining a signed number (`+N` or `-N`) with an operation unit (`*`, `\/`, etc.) or potentially two signed numbers (e.g., `+X` and `-X` to get 0).\n3.  To make a move, we need to select two unit indices.\n4.  The current board only has one unit at index 0. There is no second unit index to select.\n5.  Therefore, according to the rules of requiring two units for a combination, no move is possible with the current board state. The objective to eliminate all units to reach 0 cannot be achieved from this state.\n\nHowever, the instruction requires providing an answer in the format 'Answer: index1 index2'. This format mandates specifying two indices. Since only index 0 exists, the only possible pair of indices using available units is `0 0`. This assumes combining a unit with itself is implicitly allowed, although not stated in the rules. This move (`0 0`) wouldn't lead to the goal (e.g., if it means `-7 + -7 = -14`), but it fulfills the output format requirement under the severe constraint of having only one unit.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nThe board provided is \"0 -7\".

This would replace the two units with a single unit -7. This does not eliminate all units.\n2.  Multiplication: Combine 0 and -7 via multiplication: 0 * (-7) = 0.\nThe rules state: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\".\nIf combining 0 and -7 results in 0, then both units are eliminated, and no new unit is produced.

Combining `+N` (A) with `-N` (B) yields `Number(A)=+N`, `Op(B)=Subtract`, `Number(B)=N`, result `+N - N = 0`.

Let's assume `0` behaves like `+0`.\n2.  **Analyze the rules:**\n    *   Units with signs (`+num`, `-num`) can combine with other units.\n    *   `+num` also represents addition, `-num` represents subtraction.\n    *   Combining `+X` and `-X` (equal absolute values) results in 0, eliminating both units.\n    *   The goal is to eliminate all units.\n    *   We need to output two indices corresponding to the units to combine.\n3.  **Evaluate possible moves:** The units are `+0` (index 0) and `-7` (index 1).\n    *   The absolute values are 0 and 7, which are not equal. Therefore, combining them will not directly lead to elimination according to the rule provided.\n    *   Let's consider combining them based on the operations they represent:\n        *   Combine 0 and 1: Apply the operation of unit 1 (`-7`, subtraction) to unit 0 (`+0`). The result is `0 - 7 = -7`. The new board would contain just `-7`.\n        *   Combine 1 and 0: Apply the operation of unit 0 (`+0`, addition) to unit 1 (`-7`). The result is `-7 + 0 = -7`. The new board would contain just `-7`.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Neither possible combination (`0 1` or `1 0`) eliminates all units. Both result in a single unit `-7`. Since the goal is to eliminate all units, this state seems impossible to win from with the given rules. However, the task requires providing an operation for the current turn. As both options lead to the same non-winning state, either is a valid move to perform according to the rules of combination. I will choose the first option.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Based on the provided game board and rules:\n1.  The board contains only one unit: `-7` at index `0`.\n2.  A move requires combining *two* units by specifying their indices.\n3.  With only one unit on the board, it is impossible to select two distinct units to combine. The rules do not specify what happens when combining a unit with itself, or if such an action is allowed.\n4.  The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0. The primary way mentioned for elimination is combining a positive number `+X` with its negative counterpart `-X`. This is not possible here as we only have `-7`.\n5.  Other combination examples (`-10` with `×8`, `-7` with `÷3`) involve combining a signed number unit with an operator unit (`×`, `÷`). No operator units are present on the board.\n6.  The rules provided do not seem to allow for any valid move from the current state (`0 -7`) that progresses towards the objective. There are no two units to combine.\n\nHowever, the request requires outputting an operation by providing two unit indices. Given that only index `0` exists, the only possible pair of indices that can be formed is `0 0`. While the rules don't define the outcome of combining a unit with itself, providing this answer adheres to the requested output format, even if the move itself is undefined or impossible by the explicit rules.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the rules and the current board state:\n1.  The board contains only one unit: \"-7\" at index 0.\n2.  The rules state that units combine with *other* units. Examples show combining a signed number with an operator unit or potentially two signed numbers if they cancel out (+X and -X).\n3.  To perform an operation, we need to select two unit indices.\n4.  With only one unit at index 0, it is impossible to select two distinct units to combine. Standard interpretation suggests no move is possible.\n5.  However, the required output format is strictly \"Answer: index1 index2\".\n6.  Given that only index 0 exists, the only possible pair of indices that can be provided is \"0 0\". This implies combining the unit \"-7\" with itself. The rules do not explicitly state whether this is allowed or what the result would be. If we assume combining \"-7\" with itself means subtraction (-7 - (-7) = 0), this would meet the objective. But this is an assumption not directly supported by the provided rules.\n\nSince the format requires two indices and only index 0 is available, the only syntactically possible answer is \"0 0\".\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board state and rules:\n1.  **Board Analysis**: The board is given as `0 -7`. This most likely means there is one unit, `-7`, at index 0.\n2.  **Rule Analysis**: The rules state that combination requires *two* units. Units with +\/- signs combine with other units (examples given involve operators like *, \/). A specific rule exists for eliminating pairs: combining +N and -N removes both.\n3.  **Problem**: With only one unit (`-7` at index 0), it is impossible to select two units to combine according to the rules.\n4.  **Constraint**: The required output format is \"Answer: index1 index2\", which mandates selecting two indices.\n5.  **Reconciliation**: There's a contradiction between the rules\/board state (only one unit) and the required output format (two indices). To satisfy the output format, I must assume an interpretation that allows selecting two indices. The only possibility is that `0 -7` represents two units: `0` (presumably `+0`) at index 0 and `-7` at index 1.\n6.  **Action under Assumption**: If the units are `+0` (index 0) and `-7` (index 1), I can combine them. The only possible move is combining index 0 and index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard: `0 -7`\nThis represents two units on the board:\n- Unit at index 0: `0`\n- Unit at index 1: `-7`\n\nRules Recap:\n- Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units. Unit `-7` (index 1) fits this description.\n- The goal is to eliminate all units, reaching a final combined result of 0.\n- If a combination results in 0, no new unit is produced (the combining units are eliminated).\n- Examples show combining a signed number with an operator unit (e.g., -10 with *8 -> -80). The rules don't explicitly state what happens when a signed number combines with a plain number like `0`.\n\nAnalysis:\nWe need to combine the two units, `0` and `-7`, to achieve the goal of eliminating all units. This requires the combination result to be exactly 0.\nUnit 1 (`-7`) is a signed number unit and can initiate a combination. Let's combine it with Unit 0 (`0`).\nWhat operation takes place? The rules are ambiguous here. The examples use explicit operator units (*, \/). The definitions state that +number represents addition and -number represents subtraction, but applying this logic is also unclear (e.g., does -7 combine with 0 via subtraction? 0 - 7 = -7 or -7 - 0 = -7?).\nHowever, we need the result to be 0 to eliminate the units. Among standard arithmetic operations between -7 and 0:\n- Addition: -7 + 0 = -7\n- Subtraction: -7 - 0 = -7 or 0 - (-7) = 7\n- Multiplication: -7 * 0 = 0\n- Division: -7 \/ 0 is undefined; 0 \/ -7 = 0\n\nMultiplication (or division of 0 by -7) yields 0. Since division by zero is usually problematic, and multiplication by zero always yields zero, assuming the combination results in multiplication seems the most plausible way to achieve the game's objective. If combining `-7` and `0` results in `-7 * 0 = 0`, then both units are eliminated according to the rules.\n\nTherefore, combining unit 0 and unit 1 is the required action.\n\nOutput:\nThe required format is the indices of the two units being combined, separated by a space. The indices are 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\nIndex 0: 0\nIndex 1: -7\n\nUnits:\nWe have two units on the board: '0' at index 0 and '-7' at index 1.\n\nRules for Combination:\n- Units with a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n- '-7' is a unit of type \"-number\".\n- '0' doesn't have an explicit sign, but numerically it's neither positive nor negative.

To make progress or perform any action, these two units must be combined. There are no other options.\n\nCombining 0 and -7:\nThe rules state \"-number\" represents subtraction. If we combine 0 and -7, the likely result based on standard arithmetic or applying the subtraction operation associated with -7 would be 0 - 7 = -7 or -7 + 0 = -7. This combination does not result in 0, so it won't immediately clear the board. However, the task is to provide the operation for the *current turn*.\n\nChoosing Indices:\nThe only possible pair of indices to combine is 0 and 1.\n\nOutput Format:\nThe required output format is \"Answer: index1 index2\".\n\nConclusion:\nThe only possible move is to combine the unit at index 0 with the unit at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Based on the board state and rules:\n1.  **Analyze the Board:** The board is presented as \"0 -7\". This most likely represents two units: Unit \"+0\" at index 0 and Unit \"-7\" at index 1. (Interpreting it as a single unit \"-7\" at index 0 would mean no move is possible, contradicting the request to provide a move).\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n3.  **Determine Possible Moves:** With units \"+0\" (index 0) and \"-7\" (index 1), the only possible move is to combine these two units.\n4.  **Evaluate Combination Outcomes:**\n    *   The rules for combining two signed number units (+A, -B) are ambiguous. Let's explore possibilities based on the examples and goal:\n        *   **Addition:** Combine 0 (+0) and 1 (-7) -> 0 + (-7) = -7. This replaces the two units with \"-7\", not elimination.\n        *   **Operation Application (Rule Interpretation 1):** Assume the first index provides the number and the second provides the operation (+ adds its value, - subtracts its value).\n            *   Combine 0 1: Number=0 (from +0), Operation=Subtract 7 (from -7). Result: 0 - 7 = -7. Not elimination.\n            *   Combine 1 0: Number=-7 (from -7), Operation=Add 0 (from +0). Result: -7 + 0 = -7. Not elimination.\n        *   **Operation Application (Rule Interpretation 2):** Assume the operation associated with '-number' is negation.\n            *   Combine 0 1: Number=0 (from +0), Operation=Negate (from -7). Result: -(0) = 0. This results in 0, meaning the units are eliminated according to the rule \"If the combination ... results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\". Goal achieved.\n            *   Combine 1 0: Number=-7 (from -7), Operation=Add 0 (from +0). Result: -7 + 0 = -7. Not elimination.\n5.  **Select the Move:** To achieve the game objective (eliminate all units), the combination must result in 0. Interpretation 2 for combining \"0 1\" is the only one that achieves this. Therefore, the move is to combine index 0 and index 1 in that order (assuming the first index is the number and the second provides the operation).\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the game state.\nThe board contains only one unit:\nUnit 0: -7\n\nThe rules state that units with a sign (+ or -) can combine with *other* units. To perform an operation, we need two units. Since there is only one unit on the board (at index 0), no combination involving two distinct units is possible.\n\nThe rules provided do not explicitly define what happens when combining a unit with itself. The examples given (-10 with ×8, -7 with ÷3) involve two different units. The objective is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0. With only -7, this objective cannot be achieved in this step, and likely not at all without more units.\n\nHowever, the instruction requires outputting the operation for the current turn by providing two unit indices separated by a space, in the format \"Answer: index1 index2\". Given this strict output format requirement and the presence of only one unit (index 0), the only possible response that structurally conforms to the requested format is to use the index 0 twice.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, I understand the game rules and the objective. The board currently has only one unit: -7 at index 0.\nThe objective is to combine units until the result is 0, eliminating all units.\nThe rules state:\n1.  Units like `+number` or `-number` are value units but also represent addition or subtraction operations, respectively.\n2.  Combining units requires selecting two indices.\n3.  If a combination results in 0, the units are eliminated.\n4.  The combination rule examples show a value unit combined with an operator unit (e.g., `-10` with `*8`). The rule for combining two value units (`+number` or `-number`) is not explicitly defined by examples.\n5.  The rule \"if the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\" suggests that `(+N)` and `(-N)` might combine via addition `(+N) + (-N) = 0`.\n\nHowever, I only have one unit, `-7`, at index 0. To make a move, I must provide two indices. The only possible pair of indices is (0, 0), meaning I must combine the unit `-7` with itself.\n\nLet's consider how combining `-7` with `-7` might work based on the rules:\n*   **Interpretation 1: Default Addition.** If combining two value units defaults to addition (consistent with the `+N\/-N` cancellation rule), then `(-7) + (-7) = -14`. This creates a new unit `-14` and doesn't reach the goal of 0.\n*   **Interpretation 2: First unit value, Second unit operation.** The rule states `-number` represents *both* the value and the subtraction operation. If combining index `i` with index `j` means taking `Value_i` and applying `Operation_j` to `Value_j`, then combining `0` with `0`:\n    *   `Value_0 = -7`\n    *   `Operation_0 = -` (subtraction)\n    *   Result = `Value_0 - Value_0` = `(-7) - (-7) = 0`.\n    This interpretation uses the dual nature of the `-number` unit and results in 0, achieving the game objective.\n\nGiven that the game likely intends for a solvable state if possible, and Interpretation 2 allows for immediate victory by reaching 0, I will proceed with Interpretation 2. Combining unit 0 with unit 0 results in `(-7) - (-7) = 0`, eliminating the unit and achieving the objective.\n\nThe required action is to provide the indices of the two units to combine.

According to the rules, when the result is 0, no new unit is produced. This effectively removes the unit -7 from the board.\nThe board is now empty, which means all units are eliminated, and the final combined result is 0.

There is no '+7' unit to combine with '-7' for elimination, nor are there any other units (like operators) to combine with '-7' to transform its value.\n\nTherefore, based strictly on the rules provided, no combination operation is possible in the current turn.\n\n**Output Format Requirement:**\nThe instruction requires providing the answer as two unit indices separated by a space (e.g., \"Answer: 2 4\"). This format implies that a combination move is always expected.\n\n**Dilemma:**\nThere's a conflict: the game state and rules indicate no move is possible, but the required output format demands specifying two indices for a move.\n\n**Resolution:**\nSince a move must be specified in the format \"index1 index2\", and the only available unit is at index 0, the only possible indices to use are 0 and 0. Although combining a unit with itself seems to contradict the \"other units\" rule, providing \"0 0\" is the only way to satisfy the output format using the available index.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board and rules:\n1.  **Analyze the board:** The board contains a single unit at index 0: '-7'.\n2.  **Analyze the rules:** The game involves combining *two* units. Units like '+number' or '-number' can combine with operator units (*, \/, sqrt, etc.) or with other '+number' \/ '-number' units. The objective is to combine units until the result is 0, eliminating all units.\n3.  **Apply rules to the board:** To perform an operation, we need to select two unit indices. However, there is only one unit (-7 at index 0). Therefore, it's impossible to select two distinct units to combine as required by the general mechanism described and exemplified in the rules. The rules do not explicitly state what happens if you try to combine a unit with itself, or if an operation is possible with only one unit.\n4.  **Address the output requirement:** The task requires providing an answer in the format \"Answer: index1 index2\". Given that only index 0 exists, the only possible pair of indices that can be formed is \"0 0\". While the rules regarding combining a unit with itself are unclear or potentially disallowed (as combination requires \"two units\"), providing \"0 0\" is the only way to satisfy the required output format using the available index.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: 0\nUnit 1: -7\n\nRules:\n1.  Units with +\/- signs followed by a number can combine with other units. (Unit 1: -7 fits this).\n2.  Examples show combining a number unit (+\/- N) with an operator unit (*M, \/M, etc.). (Not applicable here as we have two number-like units: 0 and -7).\n3.  \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\".\n4.  Objective: Eliminate all units, final combined result is 0.\n\nWe need to combine Unit 0 (0) and Unit 1 (-7).\nHow do two number-like units combine? The rules don't explicitly state the operation (like addition or multiplication) for combining two numbers, except for the special case in rule 3 (+N and -N).\n\nLet's consider the possibilities for combining 0 and -7:\n*   If they combine via addition: 0 + (-7) = -7. This would replace the two units with a single unit '-7'. This doesn't eliminate all units.\n*   If they combine via multiplication: 0 * (-7) = 0. The result is 0.\n\nNow, let's look at rule 3 again: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 [...], no new unit is produced\".\nDoes this rule apply here? The result of 0 * -7 is indeed 0.\nThe part \"(i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on)\" could be interpreted strictly as the *only* condition under which this rule applies. If so, 0 * -7 = 0 would still produce a '0' unit, which doesn't eliminate all units.\nHowever, the phrasing \"i.e.\" often introduces an example or clarification, not necessarily the sole condition. A more flexible interpretation is that *any* combination resulting in 0 leads to no new unit being produced (elimination of the combined units).\n\nConsidering the Objective (\"Eliminate all units, meaning that the final combined result is 0\"), the flexible interpretation seems necessary to win the game with the current board. If combining 0 and -7 via multiplication results in 0, and this triggers the \"no new unit produced\" rule, then both units (0 and -7) are removed, the board becomes empty, and the objective is achieved.\n\nTherefore, the action is to combine unit 0 and unit 1. Assuming this results in multiplication (0 * -7 = 0), and that a result of 0 eliminates the units involved.\n\nThe required output is the indices of the two units being combined.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Units on board:\nIndex 0: 0\nIndex 1: -7\n\nGoal: Eliminate all units, final combined result is 0.\n\nRules for combining:\n- +\/- number units can combine with other units.\n- Example: -10 with *8 -> -80 (-10 is operand, *8 is operator)\n- Example: -7 with \/3 -> -2.33... (-7 is operand, \/3 is operator)\n- Rule: \"+number represents the addition operation\", \"-number represents the subtraction operation\". This likely applies when a +\/- unit acts as the operator.\n- Rule: \"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\".\n\nLet's analyze the combination of Unit 0 (0) and Unit 1 (-7).\nAssume '0' is implicitly '+0'.\nUnits: +0, -7.\n\nInterpretation 1: One unit is operator, one is operand.\n- Combine 0 1: Operator +0 (Add 0), Operand -7. Result: 0 + (-7) = -7. New unit: -7. Fails goal.\n- Combine 1 0: Operator -7 (Subtract 7), Operand +0. Result: 0 - 7 = -7. New unit: -7. Fails goal.\n\nInterpretation 2: Specific rule for +\/- units with equal absolute values.\n- Absolute values are |0|=0 and |-7|=7. They are not equal. This rule does not apply.\n\nInterpretation 3: Default operation for combining two number-like units.\n- The rules don't specify a default. If we assume addition based on the +\/- representation:\n    - Combine (+0, -7): Using +0 as Add 0 -> 0 + (-7) = -7.\n    - Combine (-7, +0): Using -7 as Subtract 7 -> 0 - 7 = -7.\n    - Fails goal.\n- If we assume multiplication is the default for combining two number units (common in some puzzle contexts, and necessary for 0 * x = 0):\n    - Combine (0, -7): 0 * (-7) = 0.\n    - This results in 0, meeting the condition \"If the combination of two units results in 0... no new unit is produced\". Both units are eliminated. Goal achieved.\n\nGiven the objective is to eliminate all units resulting in 0, and the only way to achieve this with the units '0' and '-7' is if their combination yields 0, we select the interpretation where combining '0' and '-7' results in 0 (likely via multiplication).\n\nAction: Combine Unit 0 and Unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","1.  **Analyze the game board and rules:**\n    *   The board state is given as `0 -7`. This most likely represents two units: Unit `+0` at index 0 and Unit `-7` at index 1. (Assuming `0` defaults to `+0` as per the `+number`\/`-number` format).\n    *   The goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n    *   Units are combined in pairs. The rules specify how signed numbers combine with operation units.\n    *   A specific rule states that combining a positive and negative unit with equal absolute values (e.g., `+X` and `-X`) results in 0 and eliminates both units.\n    *   The rules don't explicitly state how two signed number units combine if they don't have equal absolute values.

The original two units are replaced by this new unit. The board state becomes `-7`.\n    *   While this move doesn't immediately win the game, it is the only possible operation according to the rules and the current board state.

The example given is combining a positive and negative number of equal absolute value.\nThe unit `-number` is described as a negative number, which also represents the subtraction operation.\nTo make a move, I need to provide two indices of units to combine. Since there is only one unit (index 0), the only possible pair of indices is `0 0`, implying combining the unit with itself.\nAlthough the rules say \"combine with *other* units\", let's explore combining unit 0 with itself.\nUnit 0 is `-7`. It represents the value -7 and the subtraction operation.\nIf combining unit `i` with unit `j` means taking the value of unit `j` and applying the operation of unit `i` to it, then combining unit 0 with unit 0 means:\nOperation from unit 0: Subtraction (-)\nValue from unit 0: -7\nResult: - (-7) = 7. This does not result in 0.\n\nAlternatively, if combining unit `i` with unit `j` means applying the operation of unit `i` between the value of unit `i` and the value of unit `j`, then combining unit 0 with unit 0 means:\nValue of unit 0: -7\nOperation of unit 0: Subtraction (-)\nValue of unit 0: -7\nResult: (-7) - (-7) = -7 + 7 = 0.\nThis result is 0. According to the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\", this combination would eliminate the unit(s). Since combining unit 0 with itself results in 0, this action would consume the unit and leave nothing, achieving the objective.\nThis interpretation requires assuming that combining a unit with itself is allowed (despite the \"other units\" wording) and that the combination mechanism is value_i operation_i value_j. Given the constraint to provide a move in the specified format, this seems the only possible path to satisfying the objective.\n\nTherefore, the move is to combine unit 0 with unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board and rules:\nThe board provided is `0 -7`. I interpret this as two units:\nUnit 0: 0 (Assuming this represents +0, a number unit that corresponds to addition)\nUnit 1: -7 (A number unit that corresponds to subtraction)\n\nThe rules state that units with a +\/- sign can combine with other units. The first unit provides the number, and the second unit provides the operation. The goal is to eliminate all units by reaching a combined result of 0.\n\nLet's analyze possible combinations:\n\n1.  Combine Unit 0 (+0) with Unit 1 (-7):\n    - Number: 0 (from Unit 0)\n    - Operation: Subtraction (from Unit 1, -7 means subtract 7)\n    - Result: 0 - 7 = -7\n    A new unit '-7' would replace units 0 and 1.\n\n2.  Combine Unit 1 (-7) with Unit 0 (+0):\n    - Number: -7 (from Unit 1)\n    - Operation: Addition (from Unit 0, +0 means add 0)\n    - Result: -7 + 0 = -7\n    A new unit '-7' would replace units 0 and 1.\n\nNeither operation results in 0, so neither eliminates all units in this turn. However, the task is to output *an* operation for the current turn. Both `0 1` and `1 0` are valid operations according to the interpretation of the rules and board state. I will choose one of them. Let's choose `1 0`.\n\nAnswer: 1 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and the rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: -7\n\nRules:\n- Combine two units by specifying their indices.\n- Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n- `-number` represents a negative number and the subtraction operation.\n- If a combination results in 0, the combined units are eliminated, and no new unit is produced.\n- Goal: Eliminate all units (final result is 0).\n\nCurrent State:\nThere is only one unit on the board: -7 at index 0. To perform an operation, I need to select two unit indices. Since only index 0 exists, the only possible selection is \"0 0\", meaning combining the unit -7 with itself.\n\nReasoning for combining \"0 0\":\n1.  The unit is `-7`, which is a \"sign followed by a number\", so it can combine.\n2.  The rule states `-number` represents subtraction. If we combine `-7` (the value) with `-7` (representing the subtraction operation), a plausible interpretation is `(-7) - (-7)`.\n3.  Calculation: `(-7) - (-7) = -7 + 7 = 0`.\n4.  According to the rules, if the combination results in 0, the units are eliminated, and no new unit is produced. Combining unit 0 with itself results in 0, so unit 0 is eliminated.\n5.  The board becomes empty, achieving the game objective.\n\nThis interpretation allows for a move when only one unit exists and aligns with the rules provided (using the operational meaning of `-number` and the elimination rule for a result of 0).\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, let's analyze the game state and rules.\n\n1.  **Game Board:** The board is given as `0 -7`. This typically means there is one unit at index 0 with the value -7.\n2.  **Unit Types:** We have signed numbers (+N, -N) and operators (*N, \/N, sqrt, etc.). The unit -7 is a signed number.\n3.  **Game Rules:**\n    *   To make a move, combine two units.\n    *   Signed numbers (+\/-N) can combine with other units.\n    *   Combining a signed number with an operator applies the operation (e.g., -10 with *8 -> -80).\n    *   Combining two signed numbers likely involves addition (e.g., +A with -B -> A-B).\n    *   Combining +N and -N results in 0, and both units are eliminated.\n    *   The goal is to eliminate all units (final result 0).\n4.  **Current State Analysis:** The board `0 -7` has only one unit: -7 at index 0. The rules require combining *two* units. With only one unit, no combination according to the rules is possible.\n5.  **Output Requirement:** The output must be two unit indices separated by a space (e.g., \"2 4\").\n6.  **Dilemma:** There's a conflict: no valid move seems possible, but the output format requires specifying a move (two indices).\n\n**Possible Interpretations & Resolution:**\n\n*   **Interpretation 1: Only one unit (-7 at index 0).** This strictly follows standard notation but means no move is possible. We cannot satisfy the output format requirement.\n*   **Interpretation 2: Self-combination is allowed.** If we could combine unit 0 with itself, the move would be \"0 0\". Combining -7 with -7 would likely result in (-7) + (-7) = -14, not 0. This satisfies the format but requires assuming a non-standard rule and doesn't progress towards the goal.\n*   **Interpretation 3: The input \"0 -7\" represents two units.** Perhaps the board units are `0` and `-7`. Unit `-7` is clear (index 1). What about `0` (index 0)? It's not explicitly listed as a type. If we assume `0` is implicitly `+0`, a signed number:\n    *   Board: Index 0: +0, Index 1: -7\n    *   We can combine these two units.

No move is possible.\n- If the board has two units (interpretation 2: `0: 0`, `1: -7`), then I can select two units to combine. Unit `1: -7` is a signed number unit. Unit `0: 0` could potentially be treated as `+0`, also a signed number unit.

This might represent combining the unit at index 0 with itself, although the rules don't define the outcome of such an operation. Given the constraint to provide an answer in the specified format, using the only available index twice is the only way to construct a response.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board state and rules:\n1.  **Board State**: There is one unit on the board at index 0. The unit is `-7`.\n2.  **Objective**: Eliminate all units, resulting in a final value of 0.\n3.  **Rules**:\n    *   Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n    *   `-number` represents both a negative value and the subtraction operation.\n    *   Combining two units resulting in 0 eliminates both units (\"no new unit is produced\").\n    *   A move consists of selecting two unit indices.\n\n4.  **Analysis**:\n    *   There is only one unit (`-7` at index 0). To make a move by selecting two indices, the only possibility is to select the same unit twice: index 0 and index 0. This assumes combining a unit with itself is permitted when it's the only one available.\n    *   We need to determine the result of combining `-7` with `-7`. The rules state `-number` represents subtraction. Let's assume combining unit `i` with unit `j` uses the operation associated with unit `i` applied between the values: `Value_i Op_i Value_j`.\n    *   In this case, `i=0`, `j=0`. Unit 0 is `-7`. `Value_i = -7`, `Value_j = -7`. The operation `Op_i` associated with `-7` is subtraction (`-`).\n    *   The result is `Value_i Op_i Value_j` = `(-7) - (-7)` = `-7 + 7 = 0`.\n    *   According to the rules, if the combination result is 0, the units involved are eliminated, and no new unit is produced.\n    *   Combining `0 0` results in 0, which eliminates the `-7` unit. The board becomes empty.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Combining unit 0 with itself (indices `0 0`) achieves the objective of eliminating all units and resulting in 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the board \"0 -7\", we have two units:\nUnit 0: 0\nUnit 1: -7\n\nThe objective is to combine units until the result is 0, eliminating all units.\nThe rules state that signed numbers (+number, -number) can combine with other units. Unit 1 (-7) is a signed number. Unit 0 (0) is a number, but its type according to the rules is slightly ambiguous (no explicit sign, not an operator).\n\nTo proceed, we must select two units to combine. Since there are only two units available (Unit 0 and Unit 1), the only possible action is to combine them.\n\nTherefore, the operation for the current turn is to combine Unit 0 and Unit 1. The corresponding indices are 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Based on the board state and rules:\n1.  **Board:** You have one unit at index 0, which is -7.\n2.  **Unit Type:** -7 is a \"-number\" unit. The rules state this type represents a negative number and also the subtraction operation.\n3.  **Objective:** Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n4.  **Combination Rule:** The rules specify combining two units. Examples show a number unit combining with an operation unit, or two number units combining (specifically, +A and -A resulting in 0). The general mechanism for combining two number units isn't explicitly stated beyond the cancellation case. However, the rules state +number represents addition and -number represents subtraction. A plausible interpretation is that combining unit `A` with unit `B` applies the operation associated with unit `A` (`op(A)`) between `Value(A)` and `Value(B)`. Let's assume the format `Value(A) op(A) Value(B)`.\n5.  **Single Unit:** There's only one unit (-7 at index 0). To satisfy the requirement of combining two units and the output format `index1 index2`, the only possibility is to combine the unit with itself: `0 0`. This assumes combining a unit with itself is permitted.\n6.  **Applying the Rule:** Let's apply the interpreted combination rule to `0 0`:\n    *   Unit A is unit 0: `Value(A)` = -7. `op(A)` is subtraction (since it's -7).\n    *   Unit B is unit 0: `Value(B)` = -7.\n    *   Combination `0 0` -> `Value(0) op(0) Value(0)` -> `(-7) - (-7)`\n    *   Calculation: `(-7) - (-7) = -7 + 7 = 0`.\n7.  **Outcome:** The result is 0. According to the rule \"If the combination of two units results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\", this operation eliminates the unit and meets the game objective.\n\nTherefore, the operation is to combine unit 0 with unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Based on the rules, combinations require two units. The provided examples show combinations like a signed number with an operator unit (e.g., -10 with *8) or potentially two signed numbers (implied by the rule for reaching 0, e.g., +N with -N).\n\nThe current board only contains a single unit:\nIndex 0: -7\n\nSince there is only one unit, it is impossible to select two distinct units to combine according to the provided rules. The game rules state combinations involve two units, and the objective requires combinations to eventually reach zero. With only one unit (-7), no combination operation can be performed this turn.\n\nHowever, the output format strictly requires providing two unit indices. Given this constraint and the impossibility of making a valid move according to the rules, there might be an implicit rule or an expectation to provide a default action. The only possible pair of indices with just one unit at index 0 is \"0 0\". This would imply combining the unit with itself, though the rules don't explicitly define the outcome of such an operation. Without further clarification or rules for this specific scenario, providing \"0 0\" is the only way to adhere to the output format, acknowledging that it doesn't correspond to a clearly defined valid move in the rules as presented.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","Okay, let's analyze the board and rules.\n\nBoard:\nUnit 0: -7\n\nRules for Combination:\n- Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n- Examples show a +\/- number unit combining with an operation unit (*, \/).\n- \"-number: A negative number, which also represents the subtraction operation.\"\n- \"if the combination of two units results in 0... no new unit is produced\".\n- Goal: Eliminate all units (final result is 0).\n- Output required: two unit indices for the operation.\n\nAnalysis:\nThere is only one unit on the board: Unit 0 (-7).\nThe output format requires specifying two unit indices to combine.\nThis implies either a unit can combine with itself, or there's an error\/ambiguity.\nLet's explore combining Unit 0 with itself (indices 0 0).\nThe unit is -7. It's a \"-number\" type.\nRule: \"-number ... represents the subtraction operation.\"\nLet's interpret \"A combines with B\" where A provides the value and B provides the operation modifier. If we combine -7 with -7:\n- The first -7 provides the initial value: -7.\n- The second -7 represents the subtraction operation, possibly meaning \"subtract the value of the second unit\".\n- So, the operation would be: (-7) - (-7) = -7 + 7 = 0.\nRule: \"if the combination of two units results in 0... no new unit is produced\".\nCombining Unit 0 with itself results in 0, thus eliminating the unit. This achieves the game objective.\n\nThis interpretation requires assuming a unit can combine with itself and interpreting the combination of two \"-number\" units as subtraction. Given the constraints and rules, this seems the most plausible path to achieve the objective.\n\nMove: Combine Unit 0 with Unit 0.\n\nAnswer: 0 0","*   **Analysis of the Game State and Rules:**\n    1.  **Board:** The board contains `0 -7`. This could be interpreted in two ways:\n        *   Interpretation 1: There is one unit at index 0, and its value is -7.\n        *   Interpretation 2: There are two units. Unit at index 0 is '0' (implicitly +0), and unit at index 1 is '-7'.\n    2.  **Rules:**\n        *   Units with a sign (+\/-) followed by a number can combine with other units.\n        *   Combining `+N` and `-N` results in elimination (result is 0).\n        *   Combining `+\/- Number` (value V1) with an operator unit (`*N`, `\/N`, `sqrt`, etc.) applies the operation to V1. Example: `-10` with `*8` results in `-80` (presumably `-10 * 8`).\n        *   Combining `+\/- Number` (V1) with another `+\/- Number` (V2) where elimination doesn't apply: The rules state `+number` represents addition and `-number` represents subtraction. A consistent interpretation (matching the `+N\/-N` elimination) is that they combine via addition: `V1 + V2`.\n    3.  **Objective:** Eliminate all units (final result 0).\n    4.  **Required Output:** Two unit indices separated by a space (`index1 index2`).\n\n*   **Evaluating Interpretations:**\n    *   **Interpretation 1 (One unit: `-7` at index 0):** According to the rules, combination requires *two* units. With only one unit, no combination is possible. This contradicts the requirement to output two indices for a move. If forced to comply with the format, the only possibility is `0 0`, but this move isn't defined by the rules.\n    *   **Interpretation 2 (Two units: `+0` at index 0, `-7` at index 1):** We have two units. Unit 1 (`-7`) is a `+\/- number` type and can initiate combination. It can combine with unit 0 (`+0`). Since their absolute values are different (7 vs 0), the elimination rule doesn't apply. Applying the addition rule for combining two `+\/- number` units: `(+0) + (-7) = -7`. This move replaces units 0 and 1 with a new unit `-7`. This is a valid move according to the rules and produces the required output format (`0 1` or `1 0`).\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Interpretation 2 allows for a valid move consistent with the rules and the required output format, whereas Interpretation 1 leads to a situation where no move is possible according to the rules. Therefore, Interpretation 2 is the more likely intended scenario, assuming the game state is solvable or at least playable. The move involves combining unit 0 and unit 1.\n\n*   **Move:** Combine unit 0 (+0) and unit 1 (-7). The indices are 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the game state and rules.\n\nBoard: `0 -7`\n\nRules recap:\n- Units: `+number`, `-number`, `*number`, `\/number`, `sqrt`, `square`, `reciprocal`, `floor`, `ceil`.\n- Signed number units (`+N`, `-N`) can combine with other units.\n- Combining `+X` and `-X` results in 0, eliminating both units.\n- Combining a signed number (e.g., `-10`) with an operation unit (e.g., `*8`) applies the operation (`-10 * 8 = -80`).\n- Objective: Eliminate all units, resulting in 0.\n- Output: Two indices of units to combine (e.g., \"i j\").\n\nInterpreting the board state \"0 -7\":\nThe most likely interpretation is that there are two units on the board:\n- Unit at index 0: `0`\n- Unit at index 1: `-7`\n\nNow, how do these units combine?\n- Unit `-7` is a signed number unit.\n- Unit `0` does not strictly fit the `+number` or `-number` format (no explicit sign). It also doesn't fit the operation unit formats.\n\nLet's consider the combination possibilities:\n1.  If `0` is treated as `+0`: Combining `+0` (index 0) and `-7` (index 1). The rule for combining two signed numbers seems to be addition (based on the `+X` and `-X` cancellation rule). So, `0 + (-7) = -7`. This replaces the two units with `-7`, not achieving the goal of 0.\n2.  If `0` has a special property: The number 0 is unique in arithmetic. Multiplication by zero always results in zero (`N * 0 = 0`). If combining unit `0` with unit `-7` implies multiplication, the result would be `0 * (-7) = 0`. This eliminates both units and achieves the objective. Although '0' isn't listed as '*0', this interpretation allows reaching the goal.\n3.  If `-7` acts as an operation: The examples show signed numbers acting as values combined with *operation* units. If `-7` were an operation (e.g., subtract 7), what would combining it with `0` mean? `0 - 7 = -7`? Or apply operation '-7' to value '0'? This is unclear.\n\nGiven the objective is to reach 0, the interpretation where combining with the unit `0` results in multiplication by zero seems the most plausible way to win. Let's assume combining `-7` (index 1) with `0` (index 0) performs `-7 * 0 = 0`.\n\nMove: Combine unit at index 0 and unit at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
