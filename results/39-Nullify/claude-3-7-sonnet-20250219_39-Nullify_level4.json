First combine sqrt (2) with 110.1852 (3) to get approximately 10.5\n2. Then combine -10 (4) with this result to get approximately 0.5\n3. Then use floor (1) on this result to get 0\n4.

The units are indexed 0, 1, and 2, and they contain the values -2, -8.0, and -0.4 respectively.\n\nLet me look at the possible combinations again:\n- If we combine units 0 and 2 (values -2 and -0.4):\n  - -2 × (-0.4) = 0.8, which is a new unit\n  - Then 0.8 + (-8.0) = -7.2, not 0\n\n- If we combine units 1 and 2 (values -8.0 and -0.4):\n  - -8.0 ÷ (-0.4) = 20, which is a new unit\n  - Then 20 + (-2) = 18, not 0\n\n- If we combine units 0 and 1 (values -2 and -8.0):\n  - -2 + (-8.0) = -10, which is a new unit\n  - Then -10 ÷ (-0.4) = 25, not 0\n\nNone of these combinations lead to 0. Let me recheck if I'm interpreting the rules correctly.\n\nActually, since all three values are negative, I can't get to 0 by just combining them with the operations as described. The described operations (addition, multiplication, division) will not result in 0 when all input values are negative.\n\nBased on my analysis, none of the possible combinations of the units on the board will result in 0.

The most promising initial operation seems to be combining unit 1 (9) with unit 2 (square), which gives me 81.

Since both units 0 and 2 have signs, they will add together: -48 + (-4) = -52, which doesn't get us to 0.\n\nSince there's no apparent way to achieve 0 with the given units, combining unit 0 (-48) and unit 1 (0) seems like the best option to maintain a 0 in our set while reducing the number of units.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Looking at the board, I need to eliminate all units to achieve a result of 0.\n\nThe board has two units:\n- Unit 0: -4\n- Unit 1: -48\n\nSince the goal is to eliminate all units (reaching 0), I need to find a way to combine these two units to get 0.\n\nLet's analyze the possible operations:\n- If I combine -4 with -48, I would get -4 + (-48) = -52, which isn't 0.\n\nHowever, I notice that -48 ÷ -4 = 12, but this operation isn't defined by the rules since both are negative numbers. The rules say units consisting of + or - followed by a number can combine with other units.\n\nSince both units are negative numbers, and there's no clear operation defined between two negative numbers, I should consider whether one of these might represent a subtraction operation applied to the other.\n\n-4 acting as a subtraction on -48 would give: -48 - (-4) = -48 + 4 = -44, which isn't 0.\n-48 acting as a subtraction on -4 would give: -4 - (-48) = -4 + 48 = 44, which isn't 0.\n\nHowever, I realize that the rules mention -4 can be treated as subtraction by 4. If -48 represents -48 and -4 represents the operation \"subtract 4\", then combining them would give -48 - 4 = -52, which isn't 0.\n\nBased on the provided rules and units, I don't see a direct way to get to 0 with just these two units.

Let's see if I can use multiplication to eliminate units more efficiently:\n\nIf I combine 21.9259 (unit 0) with *9 (unit 2), I get 197.3331.\nIf I then combine that with -9 (unit 8), I get 188.3331.\nThis doesn't seem to lead cleanly to zero.\n\nLet me try a different approach using the square operation:\nIf I combine -9 (unit 8) with square (unit 5), I get 81.\nIf I combine 81 with -5 (unit 3) and -5 (unit 4), I get 71.\nThis also doesn't lead to zero.\n\nMy original plan seems most viable. Let's start by combining -5 (unit 3) with -5 (unit 4) to get -10.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","I'll analyze the board and determine the best operation to eliminate all units.\n\nLet's review what we have:\n- Unit 0: 21.9259\n- Unit 1: *7\n- Unit 2: *9\n- Unit 3: square\n- Unit 4: floor\n- Unit 5: -6\n- Unit 6: -9\n- Unit 7: 16\n- Unit 8: -10\n\nOur goal is to eliminate all units, meaning the final result should be 0.\n\nLooking at the units, I notice we have both positive and negative numbers.

Looking at Unit 0 (21.9259), if we apply floor (Unit 4), we get 21. If we can get this to -21, we'll have 0.\n\nSo I think the best first move is to combine Unit 0 (21.9259) with Unit 4 (floor):\n\nAnswer: 0 4","I need to analyze this game board and find a sequence of operations that will eliminate all units by combining them to reach a final result of 0.\n\nLet me identify what units we have:\n- Unit 0: *7 (multiplication by 7)\n- Unit 1: *9 (multiplication by 9)\n- Unit 2: square (squares a number)\n- Unit 3: -6 (negative 6)\n- Unit 4: -9 (negative 9)\n- Unit 5: 16 (positive 16)\n- Unit 6: -10 (negative 10)\n- Unit 7: 21 (positive 21)\n\nI need to find operations that will lead to all units being eliminated (a final result of 0).\n\nStarting with the number units (positive and negative), I have:\n- Positive numbers: 16, 21\n- Negative numbers: -6, -9, -10\n\nThe sum of all the number units is: 16 + 21 - 6 - 9 - 10 = 12\n\nI need to use the operation units (*7, *9, square) to transform these numbers in a way that they sum to 0.\n\nLooking at the numbers, I notice that 16 is a perfect square (4²). If I combine unit 5 (16) with unit 2 (square), I'll get 16² = 256.\n\nThen I can use unit 0 (*7) with unit 6 (-10) to get -70.\n\nUnit 1 (*9) with unit 3 (-6) would give -54.\n\nUnit 4 (-9) with unit 7 (21) would give me the sum -9 + 21 = 12.\n\nSo if I perform these operations, I'll have: 256 + (-70) + (-54) + 12 = 144, which is not zero.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Since we need to reach 0, and have multiple positive and negative numbers, I need to balance them.\n\nIf I combine:\n- Unit 5 (16) with unit 3 (-6) = 10\n- Unit 7 (21) with unit 4 (-9) = 12\n- Then, unit 1 (*9) with unit 6 (-10) = -90\n\nNow I have 10 + 12 - 90 = -68.\n\nI can then use unit 0 (*7) with my result of -68 to get -476.\n\nActually, I think a more strategic approach is needed. Let's start by combining units 5 (16) and 6 (-10) to get 6, then combine this with unit 3 (-6) to get 0. This would eliminate three units.\n\nAnswer: 5 6","I need to find a sequence of operations to make all the units combine to 0.\n\nLet me analyze the units:\n- 0: *7 (multiply by 7)\n- 1: *9 (multiply by 9)\n- 2: square (square the number)\n- 3: -6 (negative 6)\n- 4: -9 (negative 9)\n- 5: 21 (positive 21)\n- 6: 6 (positive 6)\n\nLooking at the board, I need to combine operations to eliminate everything (get to 0).\n\nFirst, I notice that units 3 (-6) and 6 (6) can combine to give 0, since -6 + 6 = 0.\n\nLet me choose these two units to combine.\n\nAnswer: 3 6","I need to find operations that will eliminate all units and reach a result of 0.\n\nLooking at the board, I have:\n- *7 (index 0)\n- *9 (index 1)\n- square (index 2)\n- -9 (index 3)\n- 21 (index 4)\n\nLet me think through what happens when I combine these units:\n\nIf I combine 21 (index 4) with -9 (index 3), I get 21 - 9 = 12.\nThis 12 could then be combined with *7 to get 12 * 7 = 84.\nThen 84 * 9 = 756.\nFinally, squaring 756 would give a large number (571536), which doesn't get us to 0.\n\nLet me try another approach:\nIf I combine *7 (index 0) with 21 (index 4), I get 21 * 7 = 147.\nThen I can combine 147 with -9 (index 3) to get 147 - 9 = 138.\nThen 138 * 9 = 1242.\nAgain, this doesn't lead to 0.\n\nThe key insight is that to reach 0, I need to eliminate a positive number with a negative number of equal absolute value. Looking at the board, I have 21 and -9. If I could get -21 or +9, I could reach 0.\n\nSince -9 * -1 = 9, I can try to create a -1 multiplication. I could achieve this by:\n1. Combining 21 (index 4) with *7 (index 0) to get 147\n2. Combining 147 with *9 (index 1) to get 1323\n3. Combining 1323 with square (index 2) to get 1,750,329\n4. Use this large number with -9 (index 3) somehow\n\nBut this approach doesn't seem to work either.\n\nSince a positive and negative number of equal absolute value must combine to get 0, and we have 21 and -9, I need to find operations that convert 21 to 9 (or -9 to -21).\n\nIf I divide 21 by 7, I would get 3, which is still not 9.\n\nLooking more carefully at the board, I realize that I need to combine units in a way that results in 0.\n\nThe most direct approach is to try to transform 21 into 9, or -9 into -21.\n\nIf I combine *7 (index 0) with -9 (index 3), I get -9 * 7 = -63.\nThen square (index 2) with 21 (index 4) gives 21² = 441.\n441 + (-63) = 378, which is not 0.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I realize I should first combine index 3 (-9) with index 1 (*9) to get -81, and then combine this with index 4 (21) and index 0 (*7) and index 2 (square) to try to reach 0.\n\nLet me try combining -9 (index 3) with *9 (index 1) first.\n\nAnswer: 3 1","I need to analyze this puzzle to find a way to eliminate all units, resulting in zero.\n\nFirst, let's understand what we have:\n- *7 (multiplication by 7)\n- square (squaring operation)\n- 21 (positive 21)\n- -81 (negative 81)\n\nThe goal is to reach 0, which typically means getting a positive and negative number with equal absolute values.\n\nLet me think through possible combinations:\n1. If I combine 21 (index 2) with *7 (index 0), I get 21×7 = 147\n2. If I combine -81 (index 3) with square (index 1), I get (-81)² = 6561, which is positive\n3. If I combine 21 (index 2) with square (index 1), I get (21)² = 441\n4. Combining -81 (index 3) with *7 (index 0) gives -81×7 = -567\n\nNone of these immediately get us to 0, so we need to look at combinations of these operations.\n\nLooking further, if we first combine 21 with *7 to get 147, then we'd have [147, square, -81]. If we then square -81 to get 6561, we'd have [147, 6561], which doesn't get us to 0.\n\nHowever, if we first combine -81 with *7, we get -567. Then we'd have [square, 21, -567]. If we then apply square to 21, we get 441, leaving us with [441, -567]. These sum to -126, not 0.\n\nWait, I misunderstood. When combining \"+number\" or \"-number\" with an operation, we perform that operation on the number. So:\n\nIf I combine -81 (index 3) with square (index 1), I get (-81)² = 6561, which is positive.\nThen I'd have [*7, 21, 6561]\nNext, combining 21 with *7 gives 21×7 = 147\nFinally, we have [147, 6561], which sums to 6708, not 0.\n\nLet's try the other way:\nFirst, combine 21 (index 2) with square (index 1) to get 21² = 441\nThen I'd have [*7, 441, -81]\nNext, combining 441 with *7 gives 441×7 = 3087\nFinally, we have [3087, -81], which sums to 3006, not 0.\n\nLet's try another approach:\nIf I combine 21 (index 2) with *7 (index 0) to get 147\nThen I'd have [square, 147, -81]\nNext, combining 147 with square gives 147² = 21609\nFinally, we have [21609, -81], which sums to 21528, not 0.\n\nIf I combine -81 (index 3) with *7 (index 0) to get -567\nThen I'd have [square, 21, -567]\nIf I then combine -567 with square, I get (-567)² = 321489\nFinally, I'd have [21, 321489], which sums to 321510, not 0.\n\nLet me reassess. The rules state that units with a sign (+ or -) can combine with other units. So:\n- 21 can combine with *7, square\n- -81 can combine with *7, square\n\nLooking at all possibilities:\n1. 21 + *7 = 21×7 = 147\n2. 21 + square = 21² = 441\n3. -81 + *7 = -81×7 = -567\n4. -81 + square = (-81)² = 6561\n\nI need to find a combination where all units are eliminated, resulting in 0.\n\nI think the best approach is to combine 21 (index 2) and square (index 1) first, resulting in 441. Then combine -81 (index 3) with *7 (index 0) to get -567. Finally, we'll have 441 + (-567) = -126, which isn't 0.\n\nLet me try another approach. If I combine -81 with square first to get 6561, then combine 21 with *7 to get 147, we'd have 6561 + 147 = 6708, which isn't 0 either.\n\nIt seems I need to be more creative. Let's try combining 21 with *7 first:\n21 × 7 = 147\nThen we have [square, 147, -81]\n\nNext, combine -81 with square:\n(-81)² = 6561\nThen we have [147, 6561]\n147 + 6561 = 6708, not 0.\n\nThis is challenging! Let me reconsider the rules more carefully. If \"+number\" or \"-number\" units combine with operation units, the operation is performed on the number.\n\nI think the key is understanding how the operations work together. It's possible we need to apply multiple operations in sequence.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I believe the correct answer is to combine -81 (index 3) with *7 (index 0), resulting in -567, and then combine this with square (index 1) to get 321489. Finally, combine this with 21 (index 2) to get 321510, which isn't 0.\n\nLet's try again. I'll combine 21 (index 2) with *7 (index 0):\n\nAnswer: 2 0","I need to solve this puzzle by combining units to get a final result of 0.\n\nLooking at the current board:\n- Unit 0: square (squares a number)\n- Unit 1: -81\n- Unit 2: 147\n\nTo reach a final result of 0, I need to find a sequence of operations that will eliminate all units.\n\nFirst, I'll apply the square operation to -81, since square is an operation that requires a number to act on:\n(-81)² = 6561\n\nAfter this operation, the board would have:\n- 6561\n- 147\n\nNow I need to combine these two numbers to get 0. Since 6561 - 147 = 6414 (which isn't 0), and 147 - 6561 = -6414 (which isn't 0 either), this approach won't work.\n\nLet me try applying square to 147 instead:\n(147)² = 21609\n\nAfter this operation, the board would have:\n- -81\n- 21609\n\nThese can be combined as -81 + 21609 = 21528, which isn't 0.\n\nLooking more carefully at the board, I notice that if I apply square to -81 first, I'll get 6561, and then if I combine 147 with it (using the implied addition from 147 being a positive number), I get 6561 + 147 = 6708, which isn't 0.\n\nWait, I think I've been misinterpreting. The rules state that \"+number\" represents a positive number and addition operation, while \"-number\" represents a negative number and subtraction operation.\n\nSo if I combine units 1 and 2, I get -81 + 147 = 66, and then I can square this result to get 66² = 4356, which still isn't 0.\n\nLet me reconsider. The combination should be:\n- If I apply square to -81, I get 6561.\n- If I then combine this with 147, I get 6561 + 147 = 6708, which isn't 0.\n\nBut since -81 has a minus sign, I should use it as a subtraction operation when combining.
