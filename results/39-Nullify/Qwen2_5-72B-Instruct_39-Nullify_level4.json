This is still not leading us to 0, but it's a small number that might be useful later.\n\nNow, the board would look like this after combining Unit 0 and Unit 3:\n- Unit 0: 0.1 (Result of 1 \/ 10)\n- Unit 1: 33.3333\n- Unit 4: -15\n\nFinally, we need to combine the remaining units to try to reach 0. Combining Unit 1 (33.3333) with Unit 4 (-15) won't directly lead to 0, but we can use the small value from Unit 0 (0.1) to adjust the result. However, the most straightforward way to proceed is to combine Unit 1 and Unit 4 first, then adjust with Unit 0.\n\nCombining Unit 1 (33.3333) with Unit 4 (-15) gives us 18.3333. Now, we need to use Unit 0 (0.1) to adjust this result. We can divide 18.3333 by 0.1 to get 183.333, but this doesn't help. Instead, we need to find a way to make the result 0.\n\nGiven the current setup, the best move is to combine Unit 0 (0.1) with Unit 4 (-15) to get -150. This is a large negative number, but it helps us progress towards 0.\n\nSo, the best move for this turn is to combine Unit 0 (0.1) with Unit 4 (-15).\n\nAnswer: 0 4","To achieve the goal of eliminating all units by combining them such that the final result is 0, we need to carefully select pairs of units that will lead to a zero outcome.\n\nLet's analyze the units:\n- Unit 0: 33.3333 (a positive number)\n- Unit 1: 4 (a positive number)\n- Unit 2: \/10 (division by 10)\n- Unit 3: -3.75 (a negative number)\n\nWe can start by combining the positive number 33.3333 with the division by 10 to reduce its value:\n- Combining 33.3333 with \/10 results in 33.3333 \/ 10 = 3.3333\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n- Unit 0: 3.3333\n- Unit 1: 4\n- Unit 3: -3.75\n\nNext, we can combine the remaining positive numbers (3.3333 and 4) with the negative number (-3.75) to try to reach zero:\n- Combining 3.3333 with -3.75 results in 3.3333 - 3.75 = -0.4167\n- Now we have 4 and -0.4167 left.\n\nFinally, we can combine 4 with -0.4167:\n- Combining 4 with -0.4167 results in 4 - 0.4167 = 3.5833\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the final result is exactly 0. Let's re-evaluate the steps:\n\n1. Combine 33.3333 with \/10 to get 3.3333.\n2. Combine 3.3333 with -3.75 to get -0.4167.\n3. Combine 4 with -0.4167 to get 3.5833.\n\nThis approach doesn't lead to zero. Let's try another combination:\n\n1. Combine 4 with -3.75 to get 0.25.\n2. Combine 33.3333 with \/10 to get 3.3333.\n3. Combine 3.3333 with 0.25 to get 3.5833.\n\nThis also doesn't lead to zero. We need to find a way to directly combine units to get zero.\n\nThe best approach is to combine 33.3333 with -3.75 first, then combine the result with 4:\n\n1. Combine 33.3333 with -3.75 to get 29.5833.\n2. Combine 29.5833 with 4 to get 33.5833.\n\nThis still doesn't work. Let's try a different combination:\n\n1. Combine 4 with -3.75 to get 0.25.\n2. Combine 33.3333 with 0.25 to get 33.0833.\n\nThis also doesn't work. The only way to get zero is to combine 4 with -3.75:\n\n1. Combine 4 with -3.75 to get 0.25.\n\nSince we can't get zero with the given units, the best we can do is to combine 4 with -3.75:\n\nAnswer: 1 3","To eliminate all units, we need to find a way to combine the units so that the final result is 0. Let's analyze the board:\n\n- Unit at index 0: 33.3333 (a positive number)\n- Unit at index 1: \/10 (division by 10)\n- Unit at index 2: 0.25 (a positive number)\n\nFirst, let's combine the unit at index 0 with the unit at index 1:\n\n- Combining 33.3333 with \/10 results in 33.3333 \/ 10 = 3.3333\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n- Index 0: 3.3333\n- Index 1: (empty)\n- Index 2: 0.25\n\nNext, we need to combine 3.3333 with 0.25 to see if we can get 0. However, these two numbers cannot directly combine to 0. Instead, we should look for another way to use the operations available.\n\nSince we have 3.3333 and 0.25, we can try to use the reciprocal operation to make one of the numbers more compatible for elimination. However, the reciprocal operation is not listed as an available unit. Therefore, we need to find another approach.\n\nGiven the current units, the best approach is to combine 3.3333 and 0.25 in such a way that they cancel each other out. Since 3.3333 is approximately 13.3333 times 0.25, we can use the division operation to balance them.\n\nCombining 3.3333 with 0.25 using division will not directly yield 0, but we can use the floor operation to round down the result to 0.\n\nHowever, since the floor operation is not directly applicable here, the best move is to combine the units to get as close to 0 as possible and then use the floor operation to round it down to 0.\n\nLet's combine 3.3333 with 0.25:\n\n- Combining 3.3333 with 0.25 using division: 3.3333 \/ 0.25 = 13.3332\n\nThis does not help, so we need to re-evaluate our strategy. The best move is to combine 3.3333 and 0.25 in a way that they cancel each other out.\n\nSince 3.3333 and 0.25 cannot directly combine to 0, the only logical move is to combine them in a way that they balance each other out. \n\nTherefore, the best move is to combine 3.3333 and 0.25:\n\nAnswer: 0 2","To eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0, we need to find a way to combine the units such that their operations cancel each other out.\n\nGiven the board:\n0 \/10\n1 33.5833\n\nThe unit at index 0 is a division by 10, and the unit at index 1 is a number 33.5833.

Combining -12 (unit 8) with 12 would result in 0, but we don't have a +12. We can try to create a 12 using existing units.\n\nLet's start by creating a 10 from the available units. We can multiply 7 (unit 0) by 2 (unit 5) to get 14, then divide by 1.4 to get close to 10, but since we don't have a 1.4, we need another approach.\n\nInstead, let's focus on creating a 12. We can multiply 6 (which is 7.4495 rounded down) by 2 to get 12. \n\nHowever, a simpler approach is to use the division operation to get a value close to 10 or 12. Let's try dividing 7.4495 by 0.6208 (which we can approximate by 7.4495 \/ 6 = 1.2416, and then multiplying by 10).\n\nBut a more straightforward approach is to use the division operation to get a value close to 10 or 12 directly. We can use the division operation to get a value of 12 by dividing 72 by 6.\n\nSince we don't have a 72, we can use the square operation to create a larger number. Let's square 7 (unit 0) to get 49, and then divide by 4.0833 (which is approximately 49 \/ 12).\n\nA simpler approach is to use the division operation directly with the available units:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 0) with \/6 (unit 4) to get 1.1667, which is not useful.\n- Combine 7 (unit 3) with \/6 (unit 4) to get 1.1667, which is not useful.\n- Combine 7.4495 (unit 7) with \/6 (unit 4) to get 1.2416, which is not useful.\n\nInstead, let's try to combine -10 (unit 1) with a positive 10. We can create a 10 by multiplying 7 (unit 0) by 2 (unit 5) and then dividing by 1.4, but we don't have a 1.4.\n\nA better approach is to combine -12 (unit 8) with a positive 12. We can create a 12 by multiplying 6 (unit 5) by 2 (unit 5).\n\nLet's try to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 0) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nInstead, let's try to combine -10 (unit 1) with 10:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 0) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nFinally, let's try to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 3) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nThe simplest approach is to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 3) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nTherefore, the best approach is to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 3) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nSo, the best move is to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\n- Combine 7 (unit 3) with 2 (unit 5) to get 14.\n- Combine 14 with \/6 (unit 4) to get 2.3333, which is not useful.\n\nTherefore, the best move is to combine -12 (unit 8) with 12:\n\nAnswer: 1 5","To eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0, we need to strategically combine units that will lead to this outcome.

Combining Unit 4 (`-12`) and Unit 6 (`14`):\n   - Result: `-12 + 14 = 2`\n   - New board: `0 square`, `1 \/6`, `2 square`, `3 7.4495`, `4 2`, `5 -8`\n\nNext, we can try to combine the remaining units to further simplify:\n\n2. Combining Unit 3 (`7.4495`) and Unit 5 (`-8`):\n   - Result: `7.4495 + (-8) = -0.5505`\n   - New board: `0 square`, `1 \/6`, `2 square`, `3 -0.5505`, `4 2`\n\nNow, we have fewer units to work with. Let's try to use the operations to get closer to zero:\n\n3. Combining Unit 3 (`-0.5505`) and Unit 4 (`2`):\n   - Result: `-0.5505 + 2 = 1.4495`\n   - New board: `0 square`, `1 \/6`, `2 square`, `3 1.4495`\n\nFinally, we need to use the remaining operations to try to get to zero:\n\n4. Combining Unit 3 (`1.4495`) with Unit 1 (`\/6`):\n   - Result: `1.4495 \/ 6 ≈ 0.2416`\n   - New board: `0 square`, `1 0.2416`, `2 square`\n\nSince we cannot directly combine the remaining units to get zero, we need to re-evaluate our strategy. However, the most straightforward step at this point is to combine the remaining units that can simplify the board further:\n\n5. Combining Unit 1 (`0.2416`) with Unit 2 (`square`):\n   - Result: `0.2416^2 ≈ 0.0584`\n   - New board: `0 square`, `1 0.0584`\n\nGiven the current board, the best move to continue simplifying is:\n\nCombining Unit 1 (`0.0584`) with Unit 0 (`square`):\n   - Result: `0.0584^2 ≈ 0.0034`\n   - New board: `0 0.0034`\n\nSince the remaining unit is very close to zero, we can consider it as a practical solution. However, the game objective is to eliminate all units, so we need to find a way to combine the remaining units to get exactly zero.\n\nGiven the constraints and the current board, the best move to continue the game is:\n\nCombining Unit 1 (`0.0584`) with Unit 0 (`square`):\n\nAnswer: 1 0","To eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0, we need to strategically combine units that will lead to a zero outcome.

Combining them would result in 2.\n   - Unit 3 (7.4495) and the result of combining units 4 and 6 (2) could be used in further operations.\n\n2. **Combine units 4 and 6:**\n   - Combining -12 and 14 results in 2.\n   - This leaves us with the board: 0 square, 1 \/6, 2 square, 3 7.4495, 5 -8, 7 2 (new unit).\n\n3. **Next combination:**\n   - We can now combine unit 5 (-8) and the new unit 7 (2).\n   - Combining -8 and 2 results in -6.\n   - This leaves us with the board: 0 square, 1 \/6, 2 square, 3 7.4495, 8 -6 (new unit).\n\n4. **Further combinations:**\n   - We can now combine unit 3 (7.4495) and unit 8 (-6).\n   - Combining 7.4495 and -6 results in 1.4495.\n   - This leaves us with the board: 0 square, 1 \/6, 2 square, 9 1.4495 (new unit).\n\n5. **Final steps:**\n   - We need to find a way to use the remaining units to get to 0.\n   - Unit 1 (\/6) can be combined with unit 9 (1.4495) to get 0.241583333.\n   - However, this does not help us reach 0 directly.

Let's analyze the board:\n\n- Unit 0: `floor` - This will round down any number it combines with.\n- Unit 1: `6` - A positive number.\n- Unit 2: `0.0852` - A small positive number.\n- Unit 3: `floor` - Another floor operation.\n- Unit 4: `-7.0817` - A negative number.\n- Unit 5: `\/2` - Division by 2.\n- Unit 6: `-2` - A negative number.\n\nFirst, let's combine the two `floor` operations (Units 0 and 3) since they don't affect the numerical value but can help in simplifying the board:\n\nCombining Units 0 and 3:\n- Result: No new unit is produced because floor operations do not combine with each other.\n\nNext, let's combine the positive number `6` (Unit 1) with the division operation `\/2` (Unit 5) to reduce the value of `6`:\n\nCombining Units 1 and 5:\n- Result: `6 \/ 2 = 3`\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n0 floor\n1 3\n2 0.0852\n3 floor\n4 -7.0817\n5 \/2\n6 -2\n\nNext, let's combine the positive number `3` (Unit 1) with the negative number `-2` (Unit 6):\n\nCombining Units 1 and 6:\n- Result: `3 + (-2) = 1`\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n0 floor\n1 1\n2 0.0852\n3 floor\n4 -7.0817\n5 \/2\n6 -2\n\nNext, let's combine the positive number `1` (Unit 1) with the negative number `-7.0817` (Unit 4):\n\nCombining Units 1 and 4:\n- Result: `1 + (-7.0817) = -6.0817`\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n0 floor\n1 -6.0817\n2 0.0852\n3 floor\n4 -7.0817\n5 \/2\n6 -2\n\nFinally, let's combine the negative number `-6.0817` (Unit 1) with the small positive number `0.0852` (Unit 2):\n\nCombining Units 1 and 2:\n- Result: `-6.0817 + 0.0852 = -6`\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n0 floor\n1 -6\n2 0.0852\n3 floor\n4 -7.0817\n5 \/2\n6 -2\n\nSince we cannot directly combine `-6` with any remaining units to get 0, we need to re-evaluate our strategy. Let's try combining `-6` with the reciprocal operation to see if we can get closer to 0:\n\nCombining Units 1 and 7 (reciprocal):\n- Result: `-6 * (1\/-6) = 1`\n\nNow the board looks like this:\n0 floor\n1 1\n2 0.0852\n3 floor\n4 -7.0817\n5 \/2\n6 -2\n\nFinally, let's combine `1` (Unit 1) with `-1` (Unit 6):\n\nCombining Units 1 and 6:\n- Result: `1 + (-1) = 0`\n\nThe board is now empty, and all units are eliminated.\n\nAnswer: 1 6","To achieve the objective of eliminating all units, we need to strategically combine units to eventually reach a result of 0. Let's analyze the current board:\n\n- **Unit 0**: `floor` - This will round down any number to the nearest integer.\n- **Unit 1**: `0.0852` - A small positive number.\n- **Unit 2**: `floor` - Another floor operation.\n- **Unit 3**: `-7.0817` - A negative number.\n- **Unit 4**: `\/2` - Division by 2.\n- **Unit 5**: `4` - A positive number.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Combining Units 3 and 4**:\n   - Unit 3: `-7.0817`\n   - Unit 4: `\/2`\n   - Result: `-7.0817 \/ 2 = -3.54085`\n\n2. **Combining the Result with Unit 5**:\n   - New Unit: `-3.54085`\n   - Unit 5: `4`\n   - Result: `-3.54085 + 4 = 0.45915`\n\n3. **Combining the Result with Unit 1**:\n   - New Unit: `0.45915`\n   - Unit 1: `0.0852`\n   - Result: `0.45915 - 0.0852 = 0.37395`\n\n4. **Combining the Result with Unit 0 and Unit 2**:\n   - New Unit: `0.37395`\n   - Unit 0: `floor`\n   - Unit 2: `floor`\n   - Result: `floor(0.37395) = 0`\n\nSince the final result is 0, all units are eliminated.\n\n### Final Move:\nTo start the process, we will combine Unit 3 and Unit 4 first.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","To achieve the objective of eliminating all units, we need to carefully select operations that will lead to a final result of 0.

Since the floor operation rounds down to the nearest integer, applying it to the numbers will not change the fact that they are non-zero and cannot be combined to produce 0.\n\nGiven the constraints of the game, it is impossible to combine these units to achieve a result of 0. Therefore, there is no valid move that can be made in this turn.\n\nAnswer: NO_MOVE_POSSIBLE","To eliminate all units, we need to find operations that will lead to a result of 0. However, given the current board, it seems the units are primarily focused on operations that do not directly involve addition or subtraction of numbers, but rather transformations like floor.\n\nThe units on the board are:\n0 floor\n1 0.0852\n2 floor\n3 0.45915000000000017\n\nSince the floor operation rounds down to the nearest integer, applying floor to any of the decimal numbers will result in 0. This means we can use the floor operation on both decimal numbers to reduce them to 0, but this does not help us achieve the goal of eliminating all units as we will still have the floor units left.\n\nGiven the constraints and the units available, it's not possible to combine the units in a way that results in all units being eliminated. However, if we follow the rule strictly and try to make a move, we can apply the floor operation to one of the decimal numbers:\n\nCombining unit 1 (0.0852) with unit 0 (floor):\nAnswer: 0 1\n\nThis will result in 0.0852 being rounded down to 0, but we will still have the remaining units.

However, since the result of applying `floor` to 0.45915000000000017 is 0, and we already have a 0 at index 2, we can use the `floor` operation on the floating-point number to match the existing 0, effectively eliminating both units.\n\nThus, the optimal move is to apply the `floor` operation from index 0 to the number at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","It seems there are no actionable units on the board as provided.

However, since we have operations that can modify these numbers, we need to ensure that the operations do not interfere with our goal.\n\nThe best approach here is to use the `0` unit to eliminate one of the other units. Since combining any unit with `0` will result in `0`, we can use this to our advantage.\n\nLet's combine Unit 3 (`-5.8317`) with Unit 4 (`0`):\n\nCombining `-5.8317` with `0` will result in `0`, effectively removing both units from the board.\n\nAnswer: 3 4","To achieve the goal of eliminating all units, we need to find a way to combine the units such that the final result is 0.

However, since the goal is to eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0, we need to ensure that the operation results in no new units being produced.\n\nSince `0` is already 0, and dividing it by 1 does not change its value, the combination of these two units will still leave us with `0`, which satisfies the condition of eliminating all units.\n\nTherefore, the correct move is to combine the units at indices 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Given the board state:\n\n0 \/1\n\nThe only units available are 0 and \/1.

We can pair it with a negative number to try to get as close to zero as possible. The best candidate here is -10 (Unit 7), as it is the largest negative number.\n\nCombining 21.9259 (Unit 0) with -10 (Unit 7) results in:\n\\[ 21.9259 + (-10) = 11.9259 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find a way to eliminate 11.9259.

We have -6 and -5, which are negative numbers, and 11.925899999999999, which is a positive number. We can use the multiplication units to adjust the values.\n\nA good strategy is to use the multiplication units to reduce the value of 11.925899999999999 to a manageable size that can be combined with -6 and -5.\n\nLet's multiply 11.925899999999999 by *7 (Unit 0):\n\n11.925899999999999 * 7 = 83.48129999999999\n\nNow, let's multiply the result by *9 (Unit 2):\n\n83.48129999999999 * 9 = 751.3316999999999\n\nThis value is too large, so we need to find a way to reduce it. We can use the floor operation to reduce the value:\n\n751.3316999999999 -> floor(751.3316999999999) = 751\n\nNow, we need to find a way to combine this with -6 and -5. Since 751 is much larger than -6 and -5, we need to find a way to reduce it further. However, the best immediate step is to combine -6 and -5 to get -11:\n\n-6 + -5 = -11\n\nNow, we need to combine -11 with 751. This is not possible directly, so we need to find another way to reduce 751. We can use the reciprocal operation to reduce it significantly:\n\n1 \/ 751 ≈ 0.001331558\n\nNow, we can combine this with -11:\n\n-11 + 0.001331558 ≈ -10.998668442\n\nThis is still not zero, but we can use the floor operation to round it down to -11:\n\n-10.998668442 -> floor(-10.998668442) = -11\n\nFinally, we can combine -11 with 11.925899999999999 to get zero:\n\n-11 + 11.925899999999999 = 0.925899999999999\n\nWe can use the floor operation again to round this down to 0:\n\n0.925899999999999 -> floor(0.925899999999999) = 0\n\nThus, the optimal sequence of moves is:\n\n1.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify units that can be combined to simplify the board:**\n   - Units 5 (-6) and 6 (-5) are both negative numbers. They cannot directly combine to zero but can be used to cancel out positive numbers.\n   - Unit 7 (11.925899999999999) is a positive number and can be used to cancel out negative numbers.\n\n2. **Combine units to reduce the complexity:**\n   - Combining unit 5 (-6) with unit 7 (11.925899999999999) will result in 5.925899999999999 (since 11.925899999999999 - 6 = 5.925899999999999).\n\n3. **Next steps:**\n   - Now, we need to use the remaining units to further simplify the board. The remaining units are:\n     - 0 *7\n     - 1 square\n     - 2 *9\n     - 3 square\n     - 4 floor\n     - 6 -5\n     - 7 5.925899999999999\n\n4. **Combine units to achieve the goal:**\n   - Combining unit 6 (-5) with unit 7 (5.925899999999999) will result in 0.925899999999999 (since 5.925899999999999 - 5 = 0.925899999999999).\n\n5. **Final steps:**\n   - We now have the following units:\n     - 0 *7\n     - 1 square\n     - 2 *9\n     - 3 square\n     - 4 floor\n     - 7 0.925899999999999\n\n6. **Combining the remaining units:**\n   - To eliminate the remaining units, we need to find a way to use the operations to get to 0. However, the current units do not provide a straightforward path to 0 without additional operations.\n\nGiven the current state, the best move to continue simplifying the board is to combine unit 5 (-6) with unit 7 (11.925899999999999).\n\nAnswer: 5 7","To achieve the game objective of eliminating all units by combining them to result in 0, we need to carefully select units that can be combined to produce 0 or can be used to manipulate other units to eventually reach 0.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n- **Unit 0**: *7 (Multiplication by 7)\n- **Unit 1**: square (Square operation)\n- **Unit 2**: *9 (Multiplication by 9)\n- **Unit 3**: square (Square operation)\n- **Unit 4**: floor (Floor operation)\n- **Unit 5**: -5 (Negative 5)\n- **Unit 6**: 5.925899999999999 (Approximately 5.926)\n\nThe key to solving this is to find a way to use the operations to create a pair of units that can cancel each other out (i.e., a +5 and a -5).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Combine Unit 5 (-5) with Unit 6 (5.926)**:\n   - Using the floor operation (Unit 4) on Unit 6 will round it down to 5.\n   - Then, we can combine -5 with 5 to get 0.\n\n### Actions:\n\n1. **Apply floor operation (Unit 4) to Unit 6**:\n   - This will change Unit 6 from 5.926 to 5.\n\n2. **Combine Unit 5 (-5) with the new Unit 6 (5)**:\n   - This will result in 0, achieving the goal.\n\n### Final Move:\n\nFirst, we need to apply the floor operation to Unit 6.

The square root of `-35` is not a real number, but for the sake of this game, let's assume it produces a complex number or an error state. Since the game rules do not specify how to handle such cases, we will assume that the game allows us to proceed by selecting the `sqrt` and `-35` units.\n\nThus, the move for this turn is to select the `sqrt` unit at index 0 and the `-35` unit at index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","To eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0, we need to find a way to use the available operations to neutralize the units.
