It seems to indicate two units, indexed 0 and 1.\nUnit 0:  '0'. Since it's just a number without a sign, we can interpret it as '+0'.\nUnit 1: '\/1'. This is a division operation by 1.\n\nNow, let's combine Unit 0 and Unit 1.\nOperation: Unit 0 (operand) operated by Unit 1 (operator).\nHowever, the rule says \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units\". Unit 0 (+0) fits this condition. Unit 1 (\/1) is \"other units\".  So we can combine them.\nBased on the examples, it looks like the order is:  Unit 0 is operated *by* Unit 1.\nIn our case, Unit 0 (+0) is operated by Unit 1 (\/1).\nThis means we perform the operation of division by 1 on the number +0.\nCalculation: (+0) \/ 1 = 0.\n\nSince the combination results in 0, no new unit is produced, and both Unit 0 and Unit 1 are eliminated.\nThus, we have eliminated all units on the board, and the final combined result is 0, which is the game objective.\n\nThe operation we performed was combining Unit 0 and Unit 1.\nThe required output format is to provide the indices of the two combined units, separated by a space.\nThe indices are 0 and 1.\n\nSo the answer is \"0 1\".\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 1 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 1 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 1 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 1 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 1 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0\nAnswer: 0 0","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Let's interpret this as representing two units, and their values are both 0. We can assume these units are represented as +0 and -0, or simply 0. Since the rule states \"units that consist of a sign (+ or -) followed by a number can combine with other units\", and '0' can be considered as both +0 and -0 in terms of value, we can assume these units can be combined.\n\nLet's consider the units as having values 0 and 0, and they are at index 0 and 1 respectively.\nWe can choose to combine unit at index 0 and unit at index 1.\nCombining these two units means performing an operation between them. Let's assume the operation is addition since we have units represented by numbers.\nSo, combining unit 0 and unit 1 results in 0 + 0 = 0.\nAccording to the rule, \"if the combination of two units results in 0 ... no new unit is produced\".\nTherefore, after combining unit 0 and unit 1, no new unit is produced. This means the units at index 0 and 1 are eliminated.\nAfter this operation, there are no units left on the board.\nThe final combined result is 0, which is also 0.\nThus, the objective of eliminating all units and achieving a final combined result of 0 is achieved by combining unit 0 and unit 1.\n\nThe question asks for the operation for the current turn by providing the two corresponding unit indices. In this case, we combined unit at index 0 and unit at index 1. So, the indices are 0 and 1.\n\nThe required output format is \"Answer: $YOUR_ANSWER\", where YOUR_ANSWER is the two unit indices separated by a space.\nTherefore, for combining unit 0 and unit 1, the answer is \"0 1\".\n\nFinal Answer: 0 1\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 0","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1","Answer: 0 1\nAnswer: 0 1"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
