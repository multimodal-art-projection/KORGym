Our goal is to eliminate all units, resulting in a final combined result of 0.\n\nLet's analyze possible moves:\n1. Combining 6 and 2 is not ideal as it won't directly lead to -8.0. Combining them using + or - will lead to 8 or 4. Multiplication will lead to 12 and division will lead to 3 or 1\/3.\n2. Combining 6 and -8.0 gives us -2 or 14.\n3. Combining 2 and -8.0 gives us -6 or 10.\n\nWe need to find a combination that can eliminate all units. Let's try multiplying 6 and 2, resulting in 12. Then we would need -12. Let's try dividing -8 by some number. Let's think step by step.\n\nThe simplest approach is adding the positive numbers. 6 + 2 = 8. Then combining that with -8.0 will result in 0. We don't have '+' operation though, so this cannot be done by combining indices. However, we *can* only output 2 indices to combine.\n\nWe can observe that 6+2-8 equals zero. The available operations are implicit, so we can combine.\nWe are only allowed to combine two numbers at a time.\n\nLet's try something else. Could we do something like:\nsqrt(6) -> sqrt(6), then multiply by 2, giving us 2*sqrt(6). How could we get -8.0?\nSince we are only allowed to combine 2 units, the answer should be indices to the game board units.\n\nI think I misread the rule regarding '+' and '-'. '+'number and '-number' imply addition or subtraction. Therefore we can combine 6 and -8.\n6 + (-8) = -2. Then we combine -2 with the remaining 2, thus: -2+2=0.\n\nSo we can combine indices 0 and 2 first, then combine the result with index 1.

If we divide by -10 and divide by 5, maybe we could achieve 0 with the other values.  It's not immediately obvious, but let's try the initial simpler calculations. Let's combine units 3 and 5: -2 + (-7) = -9\n0: 80\n1: 5\n2: \/5\n3: -9\n4: \/-10\n5: -7\n\nOkay, I will make a move that simplifies the board state.\nI will perform the division operations at index 2.\n\nAnswer: 1 2\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the board sums to zero, using the allowed operations. Let's analyze the current board:\n\n0: 80\n1: -2\n2: \/-10  (Division by -10)\n3: -7\n4: 1.0\n\nMy primary focus will be to eliminate or significantly reduce the '80' on the board since it's the largest number and therefore the most difficult to work around.\n\nLet's evaluate possible moves:\n\n*   Combining `0` (80) with `1` (-2): Would result in -160. Doesn't seem helpful.\n*   Combining `0` (80) with `2` (\/-10): Would result in -8. Still doesn't eliminate 80, but significantly reduces it.\n*   Combining `0` (80) with `3` (-7): Would result in -560. Very bad.\n*   Combining `0` (80) with `4` (1): Would result in 80. Very bad.\n*   Combining `1` (-2) with `2` (\/-10): Would result in 0.2.\n*   Combining `1` (-2) with `3` (-7): Would result in 14.\n*   Combining `1` (-2) with `4` (1): Would result in -2.\n*   Combining `2` (\/-10) with `3` (-7): Would result in 0.7.\n*   Combining `2` (\/-10) with `4` (1): Would result in -0.1.\n*   Combining `3` (-7) with `4` (1): Would result in -7.\n\nThe combination of `0` (80) with `2` (\/-10) reduces `80` to `-8`. Then combine `1`(-2) with `3`(-7) gets us `14`. Lastly, `14` and `4` results in `14`. This is not the optimal direction to minimize the board sum towards zero.\n\nHowever, there isn't a clear path to immediately getting close to zero. The best bet, I think, is to reduce `80` significantly.\n\nAnswer: 0 2\n","Let's analyze the board to find a combination that moves us closer to zeroing out the units.\n\nWe have:\n-2\n-7\n1\n-8\n\nIf we combine -2 and 1, we get -1. Then -7 and -8 would be -15. -1 and -15 would be -16. Not ideal.\n\nLet's try to make a positive number to cancel with the negative numbers. We already have 1. If we focus on getting 7 or 8, we might have something. However, using multiplication or division with the existing numbers won't help much.\n\nLet's look for direct cancellation. 2 (1.0) could cancel with 0 (-2) if we can manipulate 2 somehow.\n\nA simple approach could be to combine 0 and 2. It results in (-2 + 1.0) = -1.0. The board would then be:\n-1.0\n-7\n-8.0\n\nNow, none of these combine to 0.\n\nLet's see.\nCombine 0 and 1 which is (-2 + -7) = -9\nCombine 2 and 3 which is (1 + -8) = -7\nboard now has -9 and -7.\n\nLet's think outside the box, is there a way to use multiplication or division somehow to our advantage to reduce the units?\nIf we combine 0 (-2) and 3 (-8) it would result in -2 + (-8) = -10\nCombine 1 (-7) and 2 (1) it would result in -7 + (1) = -6.\nboard now has -10 and -6\n\nNone of the combinations work. The goal here is to arrive at 0.\nLet's try to make numbers that cancel out.\n\nCombine 2 and 3 (1 + -8) = -7.\nThe board would be:\n-2\n-7\n-7\n\nWe need a 2 and a 14.\n\nCombine -2 and -7. (-2 + -7 = -9). We now have -9, -8 and 1.\n\nLet's re-examine the initial state:\n-2\n-7\n1\n-8\n\nWe need to find a way to pair them to reach to zero.\n\nWhat if we use multiplication to get a + number.\n\nConsidering we're looking for the single next move, the goal is likely to create numbers that can cancel out in the future.\n\nIf we add the 1 to one of the negative numbers maybe?\nCombining 2 with 0 (-2 + 1 = -1) will result in the following board:\n-1\n-7\n-8\n\nLet's choose 0 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2\n","Let's analyze the board to find a combination that moves us towards zero. We have three negative numbers: -7, -8.0, and -1.0. To reach zero, we need to introduce positive numbers that cancel out these negatives. Since there are no operations available, the only way to achieve a combined zero result is to get values with equal absolute values that can combine.\n\nCurrently, no combination directly leads to zero, since all numbers are negative. The best strategy is to find a way to combine to have equal and opposite values. It's impossible to get a zero result in one step. We can sum the numbers as follows: -7 + (-8) + (-1) = -16\nLet's attempt combining -7 and -1. Since we can only combine '+' and '-' numbers, we can either combine 0 and 2, or 1 with either 0 or 2. This will result in adding the numbers. This won't lead us closer to zero.\n\nTherefore, since we can not make any beneficial move to reduce the overall value towards zero, any operation is useless.

I see -4 and 2,6, and -8. If I make 2 to 4, then combine with -4, it can result in 0. So, use index 1 (\/2) to make 4 to 2, and then use index 3 (6) multiply it.\n(3 \/ 2) * 2 = 6.

To do this, I can use \/2 to convert +2 to 1, and then multiply by 8 becomes 8, then combine with -8.\n\nLet's try to find the simplest way. The best way is using 2 and 0, 2+(-4), which results to -2. Not 0. Then, make 4 into 8, which combines -8. In order to make it work, use index 1 (\/2) and index 3 (6), 6\/2 = 3.

However, combining units 0 and 1 might be useful. We can combine -4 with 2 to get -8 if we multiply.  We can also combine -4 and 2 by adding them to get -2, which is also not helpful.\n\nHowever, notice that units 0 and 3 have the same value of -4.  So, if we can somehow create +4, then we are done. Unit 1 is 2 and Unit 2 is 6. So we can't combine them to get +4.\n\nLet's try another approach. Notice we have two -4s. If we can somehow get two +4s, then we are done. We have one 2 and one 6. We cannot combine them to get 4.\nBut wait, unit 0 is -4 and unit 3 is -4. So, -4 + (-4) = -8. We need to somehow find a way to get +8. We have 2 and 6. 2+6 = 8.\n\nThus, we can do the following:\n1. Combine 0 and 3 (add them) to get -8\n2. Combine 1 and 2 (add them) to get 8\n3.

Since we only have a negative number -8, we must find a way to combine the two positive numbers, then combine with -8 to get zero.\nThere are no operators to combine positive numbers.\n\nThe goal is to get a combination that results to 0, so let us explore possible combinations that would result in +8.\nCurrent units are 2 and 6.\nOperations:\n2+6 != 8, but we cannot directly add the numbers\n2*6 = 12, does not help\n2\/6 = 0.33..., also does not help\nWe can start from the other side:\n-8\/2 = -4, -8\/6 = -1.33..., -8 * 2 = -16, -8 * 6 = -48, -8 + 2 = -6, -8 + 6 = -2\nNone of these operations can combine the numbers to create 0.\n\nLet's assume the question has a typo.

Let's check how other numbers will combine with 1 to see if we can make it 0 at the end.\nNow look at -27.7447, if we can make the number close to 27, we can divide it by 9 to get 3. Then we can make use of -6 and 3 to achieve 0.\n\nHere is the plan:\nCombine 1 and 7, and then 2 and the result of 1 and 7.\n\nAnswer: 1 7\n","Let's analyze the board and find a combination that moves us closer to zeroing out the units.\n\nWe have positive numbers at indices 0, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Negative numbers are at indices 3 and 4. We also have a ceil operation at index 1.\n\nLet's try combining the ceil operation (index 1) with the positive number at index 0. This won't give us zero.\n\nLet's try combining the negative number at index 3 (-27.7447) and the positive number at index 2 (10). This won't result in zero.\n\nLet's try combining index 3 (-27.7447) and index 5 (3). This also won't give us zero.\n\nNow, let's explore options that directly cancel each other. We're looking for a positive and negative number with the same magnitude. There isn't an obvious combination right now.\n\nNotice that sqrt, square, reciprocal, floor and ceil operation are not present in the board.\n\nLet's re-examine the numbers, paying closer attention to potential decimal results. We can try to combine 3 and -6 to get -18 with multiplication.\n\nInstead, let's see if we can manipulate a number to get close to 0 by using multiplication or division and the other numbers. It seems we need an operation like sqrt or square to somehow relate 9 with 3, however, they are not available.\n\nSince no direct operation results in 0, let's try to reduce the numbers towards zero by combining them.\n\nI choose to combine 2 and 4, 10 and -6, to get -60.\n\nAnswer: 2 4\n","Okay, I understand the game. My goal is to find a combination of two units that will eventually lead to eliminating all units and achieving a final result of 0.

So I need to combine 1 ceil with 2 -27.7447 which results in a new unit of -27.\n\nNow the board becomes:\n\n0: 9\n1: -27\n3: 3\n4: 10\n5: 1\n6: 4\n\nNotice how 3 * 9 = 27. Therefore it is possible to eliminate the positive and negative 27, resulting in a zero. Thus combining 0 with 3 can make a useful +27 term to cancel out with the ceilinged -27 value. Therefore my move will be to multiply 0 and 3 together\n\nAnswer: 0 3\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the result is 0. I can only combine a '+number' or '-number' unit with another unit.

I'll start by trying to combine the negative number (-27.7447) with a positive number. The numbers I have available are 10, 1, 4, and 12. None of these alone will get me to zero. However, I notice I have several positive integers. Let's focus on using the floor operation (if it were available) on -27.7447, but since its not, lets try other methods. \nLet's see if some multiplication can get me to a manageable number close to 27.7447, I could use units 2, 3, 4, and 5 which represent 10, 1, 4 and 12.\n\nSince there are no operations I can perform right away, I'll have to make a somewhat arbitrary choice and hope it leads to something useful later. I will combine the -27.7447 with 12 hoping this gives me a manageable value\n\nAnswer: 1 5\n","Let's analyze the board and find a way to combine units to reach 0.\n\nThe board is:\n0: ceil\n1: 10\n2: 1\n3: 4\n4: -15.744700000000002\n\nFirst, apply `ceil` to 10. It remains 10. The board conceptually becomes:\n\n1: 10\n2: 1\n3: 4\n4: -15.744700000000002\n\nNow consider 1 * 4 = 4.

Board:\n1: 10\n2: 1\n3: 4\n4: -15.744700000000002\n\nThen, 1+2+3 = 10+1+4= 15. The board conceptually becomes\n1: 15\n4: -15.744700000000002\n\nThis still doesn't work out to 0.\n\nLet's reconsider. Apply `ceil` to 10 to give us 10. The board is:\n1: 10\n2: 1\n3: 4\n4: -15.744700000000002\n\nIs there something we can multiply to make 15.744700000000002?\n\nNo obvious moves present themselves here leading to a zero sum game. Without the option to combine units that *don't* have a plus or minus sign, it's difficult to see a clear path to eliminate everything.\n\nHowever, let me proceed under the assumption that I **must** provide an answer based on the instructions:\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","Okay, I understand the game and the rules. The goal is to eliminate all units, achieving a final combined result of 0. I need to choose two units to combine in each turn.\n\nHere's the board:\n0: 1\n1: 4\n2: -15.744700000000002\n3: 10\n\nA simple approach would be to find positive and negative numbers that cancel each other out. However, we don't have two numbers that perfectly do that right now. We need to think a little more strategically.\n\nLet's try to get two numbers that are opposites to make zero. It's worth noting that we can only directly combine units with a leading '+' or '-'. Thus, we need to combine 1 (+4) and 3 (+10) to make 14 and then somehow make unit 2 which is -15.744700000000002 into -14.\n\nSince we only have numbers we can directly add to other numbers, it is more practical to combine indices 0 and 3. It is a bit of a gamble though as if you are left with a number that is not easily combined, the puzzle may become impossible.\n\nAnswer: 0 3\n","We need to find a combination of units that results in 0. We have the numbers 4, -15.744700000000002, and 11.\n\nIf we add 4 and 11, we get 15. Then we can combine with -15.744700000000002 to almost achieve 0, but not exactly.\n\nInstead, let's consider directly combining 0 and 1. This means 4 + (-15.744700000000002) = -11.744700000000002. This does not combine to make it 0 with the remaining unit, 2.\n\nHowever, it seems there is a typo in the board information, the second unit should be -4.\n\nboard:\n0 4\n1 -4\n2 11\n\nNow, we can combine 0 and 1.\n4 + (-4) = 0\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","The objective is to eliminate all units, meaning the final combined result should be 0.\n\nWe have two units:\nUnit 0: 11\nUnit 1: -11.744700000000002\n\nCombining these directly through addition\/subtraction won't result in 0. Since we only have two units, our only option is to try to manipulate one unit to become the negative of the other. That is, we want either:\n* Unit 0 -> -Unit 1, i.e., 11 -> 11.744700000000002\n* Unit 1 -> -Unit 0, i.e., -11.744700000000002 -> -11\n\nHowever, we can't simply perform an operation between these two to directly get 0. It looks like there's no direct way to combine the numbers to get zero with the limited operations. Since we need to eliminate all units, and we only have these two, there is no way to win.\n\nIf the instruction implies that we are allowed to perform calculations, and get close to zero by cancelling out close-to-opposite values, then we could make use of the floor function. Since we need an exact zero to win, that strategy will not work here.\n\nTherefore, there is no valid move. However, the prompt requires that I choose two indices.

After that, we combine 1 and 3.\n1: \/7 on 3: 2, the result is 2\/7 which is near 0.285. Next, combine 2 and 3 will get a value of -1. Also 4 is equal to *-6, combined with 3 result into -12. I think the best approach to make more numbers is to make smaller. \n\nConsider combining 3 (2) and 4 (*-6). This results in 2 * -6 = -12.\nThen we can combine unit 6 (-10) with the result from the above operation (-12). Since it won't lead to immediate cancellation. Let's try other possibilities.\nConsider combining unit 1 (\/7) and unit 3 (2). This gives us 2\/7, which isn't very helpful by itself.\n\nLet's focus on creating smaller, more manageable numbers.

This doesn't immediately cancel anything, but it simplifies the values somewhat.\nCombining 4 (*-6) with 5 (0.0133) yields approximately -0.0798, which is closer to zero.

A simple way is to apply the reciprocal operator to 0.0133, followed by multiplying with the unit 1. However, this operation requires two steps.\nInstead, let's explore a different route.\nIf we perform 1 \/7 and reciprocal, we can create 7.\n\nLet's apply reciprocal to unit 3 (0.0133). 1\/0.0133 is approximately 75.188. So let's try another combination.\n\nConsidering the negative values -3, -10, -12, we need to create +25.\nLet's try to combine reciprocal to 1. It gives 7. Now, let's perform 1\/7 to reciprocal of 0 to achieve the inverse.\n\nAfter careful consideration, since units that do not contain a + or - sign can't combine directly, and reciprocal can only combine with a + or - followed by a number, the only legal operations allowed here are when a unit with reciprocal combines with a \/ or * followed by a number to create a new + or - number. It's difficult to reduce the overall number of units if we can't combine numbers with the same sign.\n\nGiven the rules, I'm having trouble finding a combination that immediately leads to a significant simplification. I need to pick something. Let's try to create reciprocal of unit 1 (1\/7).\n\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0.\n\nHere's my reasoning for this turn:\n\n1. **Simplify with reciprocal:** Applying reciprocal to unit 0 modifies 0 (reciprocal) to 1.\n2. **Eliminate -10 with combination of other units:** Applying division to units 1 and 7 creates the +number 7.\n\n3. **Now the board contains 1, \/7, -3, 0.0133, -10, -12**\n\nNow let us consider how to make two of them zero:\n\nWe should aim at turning \/7 into +3 to offset the -3. That would mean to multiply the \/7 unit by a number to result to 3. That means\n7 * 3 = 21\nCombining reciprocal will be difficult here. How about reciprocal unit 0 and combining with unit 3 to result in 75.18\n\nThis is a difficult board.

I'm not seeing an obvious path to 0 right away. Maybe a reciprocal followed by strategic multiplications\/divisions can reduce the other numbers, But it is not leading to zero directly.\n\nSince I have to make a move, and I don't see a clear path to victory in one move, I'll try reciprocal on 0.0133, resulting in a larger number that might be combined.

This operation results in unit 5 becoming 40.\n- After applying ceil to 39.5822, unit 5 becomes 40.\n- Then I will apply square root to unit 5. And will result in the unit 5 becomes 6.3245...\n- So, applying ceil on unit 5 doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, I will focus on making 3 to be 10.\nIf I can turn one of them to be +10 or -10.\n\nLet's try another possible move, I'll choose 4 and 6.\nCombining index 4 (-3) with index 6 (3) will give 0 when combined with +3. But we need to find a way to use * \/ operations on 3. This looks promising.\n\nLet's rethink.\n\nI see now. We have -10 at index 3. Index 1 is 10.\n\nAnswer: 1 3\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the entire board sums to zero, and certain combinations create new units.\n\nHere's my strategy for this board:\n\n1. **Prioritize direct cancellation:** Look for a +number and -number that can directly cancel each other.  Here, we have `-3` (index 2).  We need to create a `+3`.\n\n2. **Creating a +3:** Let's try creating a +3.\n* We can get closer to 3 using `sqrt` on 39.5822, which will be close to 6.29. It does not seem to help reduce other units.\n* We can use `ceil` to round up any floating point number.\n\n3. **Simplifying Divisions and Multiplications:** The `\/ -1` at index 6 will simply negate whatever it is applied to.\n\n4. **Let's use `\/ -1` on `-3` to create a `+3`**: Combining unit 2 (`-3`) and unit 6 (`\/ -1`) results in `3`. Now we have two `3`'s on the board. This may not be the best move, but we will need the combination in later steps.\n\n5. **Combine**: `2 6` will create a `+3` in the board.\n\n```\nboard:  \n0 ceil\n1 sqrt\n2 3\n3 39.5822\n4 3\n5 4\n6 None\n```\n6. **Consider `ceil`:** `ceil` on `39.5822` will result in `40` which is not helpful.\n\n7. **Consider `sqrt`:** `sqrt` on `39.5822` will result in `6.2914...`.\n\n8. **Combine the two `3`'s**: Index `2` and `4` does not result in a zero, as it becomes `6`. Let us ignore this.\n\nLet us reconsider the initial steps. A key thing to keep in mind is that if a positive and negative number with equal absolute values are operated on, no new unit is produced;\n\nTherefore, a simpler, optimal step would be to find a positive\/negative pair. I initially thought that combining `-3` and `\/ -1` on `-3` to get `3`, but this does not eliminate an element from the board.\nThere is no such direct operation.\n\nSo, let's re-evaluate and try to create opportunities. Since applying the sqrt is difficult to work with, let's just multiply with `\/ -1`.\n\n```\nboard:  \n0 ceil\n1 sqrt\n2 -3\n3 39.5822\n4 3\n5 4\n6 \/-1\n```\nOne more option can be to multiply the sqrt of 39.5822 and then ceil it. But that doesn't seem to help to eliminate units.\n\nThere is no apparent optimal move. Let us choose one randomly from the units.\nLet's multiply -3 by 4, and see if that produces a better setup. That means combining 2 5.\n\nAnswer: 2 5\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units to eventually reach zero. Let's analyze the board and find a good move.\n\nHere's the current board:\n\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: \/-1\n5: 1\n\nMy strategy is to look for operations that will result in easily manageable numbers.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate a sequence of actions:\n\n*   Apply `\/` operation on index 4 and 5.\n\n    *   `\/ -1` applied to `1` becomes `-1`\n    *   Now, let's operate the ceil function on 39.5822 at index 2. Index 0 (ceil) is operated on index 2 becomes 40.\n    *   Now take the sqrt of 40, the result is ~6.32\n    *   let's operate index 3 with the new calculated value in index 1. `3 * 6.32` and this is already not zero.\n\nLet's see if other combinations yields better results.\nIf we first apply the sqrt to 39.5822 at index 2, sqrt(39.5822) = 6.2914.\nThen we take the ceiling of that result at index 0 -> ceil(6.2914) = 7. Let's call this updated value as \"newValue\".\n\nNow we are left with the board\n1: newValue (7)\n3: 3\n4: \/-1\n5: 1\n\nThen operate \/ with indices 4 and 5. \/ (-1) with 1 = -1.\n\nNow the board becomes.\n1: newValue (7)\n3: 3\n4: -1\n\nIt is impossible to make this result in 0.\n\nLet's re-evaluate.\nLooking at index 4, since it is `\/ -1`, it will basically turn any number into its negative form.\n\nIf we combine index 5 `\/ -1`, we will have value -1.\nSo now index 4 = -1\nThen the original number 5 = 1.\nThen index 4, can be combined with index 5 by addition.\n\nLet's work this strategy:\nFirst `\/ -1` is performed on number 1. index 4 operating on index 5.\nThe result should be -1.\n\nAnswer: 4 5\n","Let's analyze the board and devise a strategy to reach zero.\n\nCurrent board state:\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the non-arithmetic operations. We can apply `ceil` to `39.5822`.\n`ceil(39.5822)` becomes `40`. The board is now:\n0: 40\n1: sqrt\n2: 3\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nLet's find the square root of 3.\n`sqrt(3)` becomes approximately `1.732`.\n0: 40\n1: 1.732\n2: 3\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nThis doesn't seem very helpful. Let's try a different initial operation.\n\nLet's reconsider the initial state:\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nWe want to end up with zero.  That means we need to combine the -1 with positive numbers. Let's aim to get a +1.\n\nIf we `sqrt(39.5822)` that would give us approximately `6.29`. Then `ceil(6.29)` would give us `7`. Then `7` and `3` could multiply to give `21`. Then we need `-21` to combine with the existing `-1`.\n\nLet's start with taking the ceiling of 39.5822:\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n`ceil(39.5822)` becomes `40`.\n0: 40\n1: sqrt\n2: 3\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nNow let's try something else. Let's try multiplying 3 by 3 to get 9.\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\nMultiplying indices `3` and `3` doesn't change the board. That wasn't smart.\n\nOkay. The simplest thing to do is use the ceil and the -1 directly.\n\nIf we take the `ceil` of the `-1`, we get `-1`. `ceil(-1)` is -1. Not helpful.\n\nLet's go back to the sqrt strategy. The square root of 39.5822 is around 6.29. Applying ceil to that gives us 7. Let's try that.\n`sqrt(39.5822)` becomes `6.29`.\n0: ceil\n1: 6.29\n2: 3\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\nApply ceil to 6.29, result is 7\n0: 7\n1: 3\n2: 3\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nWe have +7, +3, +3, +3 and -1. That's +16 -1 = 15.\n\nNo clear immediate solution. Let's rethink.\n\nIf we can make +1, we can cancel out -1. We have only integers here.\n\nLet's look at other options for combining.\nI can't see a direct and obvious solution. Let me choose ceil and sqrt. It won't achieve the desired result but will help assess if there's any immediate value in these two operations.\nAnswer: 0 1","Okay, let's analyze the board and find a suitable operation to move towards the goal of eliminating all units.\n\nCurrently, we have:\n0: ceil\n1: sqrt\n2: 39.5822\n3: 3\n4: -1.0\n\nMy thought process is as follows:\n1. **Apply `ceil` to `39.5822`**: `ceil(39.5822)` results in `40`. This might be a good starting point as we can then use `sqrt` and other operations.\n2. **Apply `sqrt` to the result `40`**: the square root of 40 is around 6.32, not ideal, perhaps try `sqrt` on unit 2.\n3. **Apply `sqrt` to `39.5822`**: sqrt(39.5822) is nearly 6.29. We can then apply the ceil function to get 7. But there is no direct way to combine it with -1 to get closer to the target.\n4. **Consider ceil(3) which remains 3**. sqrt of 3 is 1.73.\n\nNow, let's explore applying operations to the existing integer values. Specifically, let's try `ceil` on `3`.\n0: ceil(3) -> 3\n\nSince it does nothing, let's now try `sqrt` on unit 3.\n1: sqrt(3) = ~1.732\n\nSince we need to obtain 1 or -1 to cancel -1.0, we should focus on unit 2.\n\nLet's try `ceil` on unit 2.\n0: ceil(39.5822) = 40.\nNow, let's consider unit 1: sqrt(3).\n\nHowever, nothing directly cancels the -1. Thus, our best bet is to modify unit 2 into 1 (or a similar value).\n\nWhat we should prioritize is to manipulate the value to obtain +1 to offset -1. After some more thought, there isn't a clear immediate move that significantly simplifies the board towards reaching zero. We should look for operations that can combine directly with the existing units.\n\nTherefore, a reasonable starting move would be to try `ceil` on `39.5822`:\n\nAnswer: 0 2\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and find a valid move to eliminate units, aiming for a final result of 0.\n\nCurrent board:\n0: sqrt\n1: 3\n2: -1.0\n3: 40\n\nFirst, let's apply the square root to the number 40 using the 'sqrt' unit. This does not lead to an integer. Instead let's try squaring the 3 by taking the square root of 40 and see if this brings the -1 to -3.\n\nOperation idea:\n1. sqrt 40 = 6.32..\nThis doesn't lead to anything.\n\nAlternative:\nApply sqrt to 40. Then there's no clear way to combine the result to produce 1, to nullify -1.\n\nLet's analyze by value:\nsqrt(40) ~ 6.32\n3\n-1\n40\n\nIf we can create the number '1' through the game, we can combine it with '-1'\nLet's see if we can get 1\n3 \/ 3= 1\nsqrt(1) =1\nor create something with abs(value) of '1' by applying operations to others.\n\nApplying sqrt to index 3 would transform 40 into approximately 6.32. Applying sqrt to 3 turns to 1.73. Neither looks advantageous for getting close to 1, or close to 0 to be able to be combined easily.\n\nHowever, there's a trick we could try. I'm not sure if this is allowed according to your prompt, but it could produce a result of \"1\":\nIf we * 3 by 1\/3, then we get 1 which then leads to canceling out -1.\n\nHowever, there's no 1\/x operation either!\n\nIt appears that there is NO valid operation sequence that can lead to 0. Since the instructions say:\n\"If the combination of two units results in 0 (i.e. when a positive and a negative number with equal absolute values are operated on), no new unit is produced\"\nAnd since sqrt is a special operation on a unit value, and can't be combined like +,-,\/,* I can't make ANY valid operations to reach 0.\n\nTherefore, I can only make a single immediate combination.\n\nThe only immediate combination is +1 and -1, but alas there is no +1. I think there is NO combination that leads to a solution, given the operation constraints.\n\nAnswer: 2 2\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the result is 0. Let's analyze the board:\n\n*   **0:** sqrt\n*   **1:** 3\n*   **2:** -1.0\n*   **3:** 40\n\nHere's a possible strategy:\n\n1.  Apply the square root to unit 3: sqrt(40) ≈ 6.32. This doesn't get us closer to eliminating -1.0.\n2. Try applying sqrt to unit 1: sqrt(3) = 1.732. Still not good.\n3. If we can get sqrt to work with 40, we need to somehow get to 1.\n4. Let's try another approach. Focus on eliminating the -1.0.\n5. We need to create a +1.0 to cancel it. Is there a way to get +1.0? sqrt of 1 = 1.\n6. sqrt of 1 is 1. Let's see if units 1 and 3 can get to sqrt of 1.\n7. If unit 1 and 3 are divided, 3\/40 = 0.075. Let's try something else.\n\nI can't see a clear path to 0 with a single combination. I will select an operation that at least simplifies the board in hopes of future moves leading to elimination. Applying the square root to 40 seems like a good starting point, as it reduces the magnitude of that unit. So I'll combine the square root with 40.\n\nAnswer: 0 3\n","We have the following units:\n0: 3\n1: -1.0\n2: 6.324555320336759\n\nThe goal is to combine units until we reach 0.\nWe can start by exploring combinations.\nIf we add units 0 and 1: 3 + (-1.0) = 2. This doesn't lead to 0.\nSince there is no operation to perform using units that do not contain + or -, simply adding them may not work.\nHowever, 3 and -1.0 can be combined to obtain 0 using other operations or units.\nNotice that 6.324555320336759 is approximately the square root of 40.\nSince we need to somehow reach 0, simply adding 3 and -1.0 doesn't help.

Similarly, -1.0 and 6.324555320336759 don't help us.\n\nThere seems to be no straightforward combination that leads to 0 in one step. Therefore, the problem is impossible to solve in one step.\nLet's assume that sqrt(9)=3. If we have 9 and sqrt, it can become 3.\n\nGiven units 3 and -1.0, we need to eliminate all units. There is no obvious way to combine the units to achieve a result of zero. Since the rules also mention that if non + or - units are present, they may not directly combine.\n\nWith units 3 and -1, one possible, though indirect, interpretation is we perform 3 + (-1) = 2. We are left with 2. To achieve zero, we need -2. However, this is not the correct method.\n\nSince the question asks for an operation for the current turn, there isn't a valid operation with the current units to reach 0.\nWe are given 3 and -1.

Since we do not have square root, it is less likely that we can get to 0 directly.\n\nConsider unit 8. The reciprocal of it will be 6\/7.

I see -6 at index 0 and -6 at index 5.\n2. **Target 6:** I need to create a +6. We have \"7\" (index 1) and \"7.4495\" (index 4) that could be potentially manipulated.\n3. **Square root & Square:** We have square root at index 3. We have a \"7.4495\". \"7.4495\" is the square root of \"55.5\". \"7\" squared is 49 which will not help us. Applying square root to 7.4495 is not efficient. However, the number 7 at index 1 if squared can make 49, but no direct use for now.\n4. **Division:** We have \"1.1666666666666667\", which looks like 7 divided by 6.\n\nLet's try to make positive 6 first. We have 7 and 1.1666666666666667 at hand.  7 - 1.1666666666666667 * x = 6. x= 1. So, we can not combine to make 6 directly.\nLet's consider other options.

Let's analyze the board and find a good move.\n\nHere's the board:\n0: -6\n1: -10\n2: square\n3: 7.4495\n4: -6\n5: 4\n6: 8.166666666666666\n\nFirst, I observe that I have two '-6' units (0 and 4), these can combine with a '+12' unit. I will attempt to create it using other available units.\nI also observe that 3 and 6 looks like the square root and value square root of 64.\n\nSquare root of (5) is 2 and 7.4495 approx. sqrt(55.5). Lets not consider it.\nIf i square 3 I will get a positive number.\n\nI can combine 2 (square) with 3 (7.4495) to give 55.49... which is approx 55.5\n\nNow consider unit 6. Looks like cube root of 4 is almost 1.58... which is not useful.\n\nLets square the number at index 5:\nsquare 4 = 16.\n\nLets consider a square root, no sqrt operation.\n\nLets try to get positive 12.\n\nIf i multiply 10 by 1.2 or 6 by 2 or 4 by 3.\n\nlets try to create 12.\n\nLets try 0 and 4. The sum is -12.\n\nLet's try square unit at index 5. square(4) = 16\nsquare root of 16 = 4. which doesn't help me much.\n\nLet's look at indexes 0 and 4. Together -12. We need positive 12.\n\nIndex 5, 4. Lets try 4*3=12\nis there a 3 unit.\n\nLet's try unit 3. We can see that 3 is almost sqrt(55.5) and 6 is cube_root(540).\nLets look at index 2. square. 2(5) = 16. Now we have 16 and 0 and 4 which are -6.\n\nSince 0 and 4 are same, lets target that, -12. Lets get a positive 12.\n\nLet's try index 5, which is 4. Lets * 3 = 12. No 3 available.\n\nHere's my plan: Combine units 0 and 4 to get -12. Then, create +12 from other units.\n\nI can create 12 if i combine unit 5 with some other.\n\nHowever, a quick win would be to use 0 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 0 4\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until I reach 0.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1. **Prioritize + and - combinations**: Since the objective is to reach 0, the easiest way to do that is by cancelling out positive and negative numbers. I have -10 (index 0) and -12 (index 5).\n2. **Exploit Square root and Square relationship**: I see 7.4495 (index 2) and square(index 1) and 4(index 3). square root 7.4495 is arround 2.7, 2.7square is 7.4495\n3. **Look at Multiplication and Division operations**: Multiplication and Division operations usually lead to bigger results that are hard to balance.\n4. **Floor and Ceil** In this situation, it will not lead to an immediate solution.\n5. **Try to Combine 0 and 5** If I can combine them to near 0, maybe other value can combine other value to 0.\n\nBased on the board, the best first move is to try and manipulate the existing numbers to be closer to 10 or 12.\n\nLet's calculate 2 square: 7.4495 * 7.4495 which is 55.49\n4 * 4 = 16\n\nConsidering all of the above, I think I can choose square and the result from index 2\nLet's see if I square 2 and can get close to 10.\n\nLet's also try to change index 3 to near 10 or 12 using other index.\n\nA good approach might be to try to get `4` closer to a multiple of `10` or `12`. I could manipulate 8.166666666666666 closer to 10 or 12, or use square on 4(index 3), result in 16.\n\nGiven the current board state, the best move is to combine square(index 1) to 7.4495(index 2)\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the overall result is 0. Let's analyze the board and try to find a good move.\n\nCurrently, we have:\n-10\n4\n8.166...\n-12\n55.495...\n\nIt's hard to combine these directly to get 0 right away. I need to find combinations that simplify the board and potentially lead to cancellation.\n\nLet's start with the two negative numbers, 0 and 3. Combining them would give -22. That's not very helpful. Let's look at 1 and 2; those aren't easily combined either. 4 seems very difficult to deal with due to its large value.\n\nMy current strategy is: find combinations that might get me closer to smaller, more manageable numbers. Since there is no direct addition possible, it's hard to eliminate units by combining. I need to think about how to create equal and opposite numbers.\n\nLet's rethink. I don't see a direct combination that will lead to quick elimination. The numbers are not easily compatible. Given the constraints and without further operations available, it is impossible to reduce the units to zero with only the existing operations in the current state.\n\nSince a valid answer that adheres to the required format is mandatory, I will choose two units at random, even if they don't seem to be the most strategic choice. I'll pick unit 0 and unit 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units to reach zero. I need to look for combinations that result in zero or lead to a state where zero can be achieved.\n\nCurrently, I have the following values:\n0: 8.166666666666666\n1: -12\n2: 55.49505024999999\n3: -6\n\nI notice that no two numbers directly add up to zero. I don't have any operators to easily manipulate these numbers to make them opposites. I can try to combine some negative numbers to approach the positive number more closely.\n\nLet's combine -12 and -6 using addition. That is, I want to add -12 and -6 to get closer to 8.166666666666666 or to -55.49505024999999, which is possible using -12-6 = -18, by not directly adding them will be useless here.\n\nBut there's another consideration: if combining two values never leads to a cancellation, it's useless. I'll examine more closely.\n\nI will combine index 1 and index 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3\n","We need to find a way to combine the units to reach 0. Currently, we have 8.166666666666666, 55.49505024999999, and -18.\n\nLet's consider combining 0 and 2:  8.166666666666666 + (-18) = -9.833333333333334.  This doesn't get us closer to 0 with unit 1.\n\nLet's try to manipulate unit 1 to something closer to 18 or 8.166666666666666. Since we only have + and - operators to combine, let's just add them.\n\nThere's no clear simple combination here to get to 0. We need more operators to manipulate the numbers into a more useful state.\n\nBecause there's no immediate solution, this likely means no moves are possible in the current state based on the allowed operations.\n\nAnswer: 0 0\n","The goal is to reach 0 by combining units.

This yields *4 * -1 = -4, which can be added to one of the negative numbers to get closer to zero.\nConsider elements 4 and 1. The result is *(-1 * 4)=*-4\n\nLet's try a specific set of operations:\n\n1.  Unit 3 (square) on Unit 2 (0.5528) : square(0.5528) ≈ 0.305588\n2.

Combining these directly to get 0 would be ideal. However, we can't directly combine them.

We need to transform them into something we can combine or use in a different operation.\n- `0` is reciprocal, could be applied to transform the numbers on the board.\n- `3` is division by -5.\n- `7` is ceil, which could turn -3.5 into -3.\n- `8` is -3.5\n- `9` is 4.1667\n\nIf we apply `ceil` to `8`, we get -3.\nThen we can divide `6` (9) by `3` which is -5.\nThen we can multiply it against another number.\n\nIf we do `0 9`, we get 1\/4.1667 which is approximately 0.24. No help there.\n\nLet's try something simpler. `7 8` applies ceil to -3.5. `8` becomes -3.\n\nNow our board is:\n0 reciprocal\n1 -9\n2 107.9254\n3 \/-5\n4 2\n5 1\n6 9\n7 ceil\n8 -3\n9 4.1667\n\nNext, do division.\n\nLet's divide `6` by 3. `3 6`. 9 \/ -5 = -1.8\n\nNow our board is:\n0 reciprocal\n1 -9\n2 107.9254\n3 \/-5\n4 2\n5 1\n6 -1.8\n7 ceil\n8 -3\n9 4.1667\n\nNo clear moves. Let's try `ceil` and `4`.\n\nLet's try dividing by `4`.\n3 4. 2 \/ -5 = -0.4.\n\nI think a good approach is trying to turn some numbers to the additive inverse of another number.\n\nFirst, let's use the reciprocal. `0 4` -> 1\/2 = 0.5\nThe board is:\n0 reciprocal\n1 -9\n2 107.9254\n3 \/-5\n4 0.5\n5 1\n6 9\n7 ceil\n8 -3.5\n9 4.1667\n\nNext: `7 8` -> -3\nThen we have a `-9` and a `9`, but no '+'.\n\nI will perform the first move:\n\nAnswer: 7 8\n","Let's analyze the board and find a combination that leads to simplification or elimination.\nWe have:\n0: reciprocal\n1: -9\n2: 107.9254\n3: \/-5\n4: 2\n5: 1\n6: 9\n7: 4.1667\n8: -3\n\nNotice that we have -9 at index 1 and 9 at index 6. Combining them isn't a direct elimination, but consider using the division operation at index 3, which is '\/-5'. If we could create a unit with the value '5' and combine it with '\/-5', the resulting unit would be -1. Then, we look for ways to create '3' or similar combinations to approach zero.\n\nAlso, we have a '-3' at index 8. Combining '+9' (index 6) and '-9'(index 1) would lead to zero directly. Let's start by trying to get '9' and '-9' closer.\n\nLet's try to utilize the reciprocal operator at index 0. Finding which unit apply to the reciprocal operator that can produce useful result.\nIf we apply the reciprocal operator to 1 (index 5), it becomes 1. This doesn't help.\nIf we apply it to 2 (index 4), it become 0.5. This also does not seem directly useful.\nApplying it to 4.1667 (index 7) would not produce a simple number.\n\nLet's try to utilize the division operation at index 3. Applying '\/-5' to 2 results in -0.4 which isn't helpful.\n\nNotice that 9 (index 6) and -3 (index 8), combining them can lead to simplification. 9 + (-3)*3 = 0. So, we should try to make the number at index 8 becomes -3.\nWe can use the fact that 1 (index 5) * 2 = 2, but there is no operation to get to 3.\n\nWe have +9 and -9. If we can turn index 8 (-3) into 3, then we have -3 * 3 = -9 and +9 can cancel it.\n\nHowever, let's look at the simplest combination first. 1 + (-9) + 9 + (-3) + 2 = 0.\nThen we apply reciprocal to index 7 (4.1667). It becomes 0.24.\nWe have 107.9254 \/ -5. = -21.5851\nI think the key is to try to zero out the value step by step.\n\nIndex 1 (-9) and index 6 (9), 1+6 = 0\nIndex 8 (-3) + 1 (reciprocal 5)-> we divide 2\/-5 and we get -4.\nNow, let's consider 1 (index 5), 4 (index 4), and 6 (index 1), and 8 (-3).\n\nThe easiest way is to combine 1 (index 5) + 8 (index -3), let us see if anything leads to 3.\nThe trick might be the use of \/ by a number.\nIndex 1 ( -9) and 6 (9). This might cancel out.\nLet's see 0 reciprocal with 7 4.1667. Reciprocal of this is 0.24.\n\nLet's use 1 + 6 since -9 + 9 = 0.\n\nAnswer: 1 6\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the board evaluates to 0. Let's analyze the board:\n\n0: reciprocal (acts on the next number)\n1: 107.9254\n2: \/-5  (division by -5)\n3: 2\n4: 1\n5: 4.1667\n6: -3\n\nHere's my strategy. First, perform the reciprocal operation. Then, multiply by -5. Then, perform the square operation. Finally, sum everything up.\n1. Apply reciprocal to 107.9254. 1\/107.9254 = 0.0092656\n\nSo the new board is (after applying the reciprocal):\n1. 0.0092656\n2: \/-5\n3: 2\n4: 1\n5: 4.1667\n6: -3\n\nNow let's try to approximate 0 by multiplying by -5. \n\/-5 acting on 4.1667 = -0.83334.\nSince the square operation can generate positive numbers and is powerful, let's try to create some opposite numbers.\n\nLet's combine the division by -5 with 4.1667:\n\n2 5\n\nThis results in -0.83334. Our board is now:\n\n0. 0.0092656\n1: 2\n2: 1\n3: -3\n4: -0.83334\n\nThis is very difficult because we have to get extremely precise.\n\nI want to attempt to remove some elements so the board is shorter.\nLet's look at the original board again:\n0 reciprocal\n1 107.9254\n2 \/-5\n3 2\n4 1\n5 4.1667\n6 -3\nWhat if we just try to get rid of some values first?\nLet's just add 2 + 1 -3 and see what we get.\n3 4 6\nThis will result in 0, but that's not legal because that's not an operation.\n\nLet's try reciprocal on 107.9254 again.\n\nAfter which we apply divide by -5 on that new value to create more manageable values:\n0 1\n2 1 (after the reciprocal changes the board)\nThis gives approximately -0.001853. Not helping.\nSo we need bigger numbers.\n\nLet's try to use 2 to multiply 4.1667 to get 8.3334 and somehow cancel out the -3 to become -5, and then cancel it out with the division by -5. But I don't see an obvious way to do that.\n\nI'm going to focus on eliminating -3 from the board, since that's the largest number.\nIf I can make 4.1667 to 3 and add -3, it would be helpful. But that's not an operation we have.\n\nI see no clear moves, and the game is very difficult. I am going to just eliminate two numbers in the hope that future turns will provide opportunities. I can eliminate 4.1667 and 2, or 1 and -3. I will just eliminate 2 and 4.1667. Since there is no way to directly combine these.\nLet's operate on 2 and 5\n\nAnswer: 3 5\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the board state effectively sums to zero. Let's analyze the board:\n\n*   **0 reciprocal:** This turns 107.9254 into its reciprocal: 1\/107.9254 ≈ 0.009265.\n*   **1 107.9254:** A positive number.\n*   **2 \/-5:** This divides 1 by -5 which equals -0.2.\n*   **3 1:** A positive number.\n*   **4 -3:** A negative number.\n*   **5 6.1667:** A positive number.\n\nFirst, let's try to make the value of index 1 into 3, and combine with index 4.\nMultiply index 1 by index 2:\n1 * 2 = 107.9254 \/ -5 = -21.58508\n\nNext, we can apply the 'floor' operation to index 5: `floor(6.1667) = 6`.\n\nThe board becomes:\n0 reciprocal\n1 107.9254\n2 \/-5\n3 1\n4 -3\n5 6.1667\n\nLet's use reciprocal on unit 1\n0 reciprocal\n1 0.009265\n2 \/-5\n3 1\n4 -3\n5 6.1667\n\nMultiply 3 by 5\n0 reciprocal\n1 0.009265\n2 \/-5\n3 6.1667\n4 -3\n5 6.1667\n\nLet's try combining unit 3 and unit 4, so that we can make an approximately 0 value. First we must use the multiplication.\n\nMultiply unit 2 by unit 5:\n\/-5 * 6.1667 = -1.23334\n\nThen add to unit 4\n-1.23334 + -3 = -4.23334\n\nWe have not found the best answer. Let's reconsider from the beginning.\nCombine index 3 and 4: 1 + (-3) = -2\nCombine index 2 and 5: -5 \/ 6.1667 = -0.8107\n\nLet's perform the reciprocal operation on index 1. This turns 107.9254 into 0.009265. Since no operation makes the total value to zero, this task is impossible.\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","Let's analyze the board and try to find a combination that leads to simplification or cancellation.\n\nWe have the following units:\n0: \/-5 = -0.2\n1: 1\n2: -3\n3: 6.1667\n4: 0.009265659427715811\n\nIf we combine units 2 and 3, their sum is close to 3.1667. This doesn't seem immediately useful.\nIf we combine units 0 and 1, we get -0.2 + 1 = 0.8. This doesn't seem immediately useful either.\nLet's try to get a positive and negative number with equal absolute values. We have one negative number, -3.\nLet's see if we can manipulate other units to get a positive 3.\nIf we combine unit 1 (1) with 0 (\/-5), we get 0.8. Then adding unit 3 (6.1667) and 4 (0.009265659427715811) will be around 6.17, far from 3.\nLet's consider the units 3 and 4 first. The unit 3 is 6.1667. This looks suspiciously like 37\/6, which is close to 6.1666... Also, 0.009265659427715811 is close to 1\/108.\n\nIt doesn't seem obvious to find pairs to sum to zero. Let's rethink the goal. Can we find an approximation to zero using combinations of more than two units?\nThe simplest thing is to try to combine more units until the board is reduced.\n\nConsider combining 2 and 3 first. -3 + 6.1667 = 3.1667\nThen we have:\n0: \/-5 = -0.2\n1: 1\nnew: 3.1667\n4: 0.009265659427715811\n\nCombining 0 and 1 gives 0.8. Then combine with unit 4 gives 0.809265659427715811\nNow we have:\nnew: 0.809265659427715811\nnew: 3.1667\n\nThis does not seem useful.\n\nAfter some inspection, I noticed 6.1667 is approximately equal to 37\/6. And 0.009265659427715811 is approximately 1\/108.\nSo 37\/6 + 1\/108 = 667\/108 = 6.1759259... Close to 6.1667\n-0.2 + 1 = 0.8\n-3 + 6.1667 + 0.009265659427715811 + 0.8  = 3.9759\n\nThis isn't leading anywhere.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is finding an approximation that leads to zero. Since it is hard, I need to give a solution. There might be a clever trick I'm missing. I am going to give the solution that involves units 2 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 2 3\n","Okay, I understand the game and the goal. I need to find a pair of units that, when combined according to the game's rules, will either result in zero or allow me to progress towards the final goal of eliminating all units.\n\nIn this particular board, the most direct approach to creating zero is to find a positive and negative number with the same absolute value. Since this isn't possible, and there are no + or - operations, I will look for a move that simplifies the board and potentially leads to a zero later.\n\nConsider the following:\n*   Units 1 (1) and 2 (0.009265659427715811): Neither of these are operators, they can't be combined.\n*   Unit 0 (\/-5): this means divide by -5.\n*   Unit 3 (3.1666999999999996):\n\nLet's try combining unit 1 (1) with unit 0 (\/-5): 1 \/ -5 = -0.2.

Combine unit 0 with unit 2. This gives 21.9259 * 21.9259 = 479.  Now, let's try the same with 4 to remove non integer numbers. 4 and 4 should square the integer. Since 4 is already squared in index 4 let's try indices 0 and 4.\n2. **Aim for +9 and +10**: My current negative numbers are -9, -10 and -2. I need to create +9 and +10 to eliminate.\n3. **Utilize multiplication:** Multiplication can significantly change the value, helping to create the desired positive numbers.\n4. **Square root could be valuable if we get a perfect square.**\n5. **Floor will always get rid of decimal numbers.**\n\nNow, here's my first move: Let's square 21.9259.\nCombine 0 with 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2\n","Okay, I understand the game. I need to find a pair of units that, when combined, will either directly result in 0 or lead to a state where eliminating all units becomes more feasible.

In this case, I see that I have -9 (index 4). I should aim to generate +9. Given the presence of multiplication and square operations, creating positive numbers from negatives seems hard. Let's try to modify the existing positive numbers to cancel the -9. Given that I also have -2 and -10, my best bet is trying to reduce the value of 480.74 to something close to those values, such as *7 or *9 which would result into +9. Let us try *7 (index 0) with 480.74 (index 7). Unfortunately, this won't work.\n\nInstead, let's focus on squaring and flooring. The square operation (index 2) can turn -2 (index 6) into 4. If we square -2 to become 4, it does not lead to much use of -9 or -10. So it won't work here.\nHowever, looking at *9 and -9, I think I need to eliminate the multiplication operations first to have easier time.\nIn fact, if I apply the \"floor\" operation to index 7, it becomes 480.\nIf I do floor (3) to 480.745 (7), it becomes 480. And then, doing division by 7, it won't produce +9 or +10.\nThe best strategy here is simply finding two that sums to 0. Given that the numbers here do not cancel out, I believe this game is not solvable.\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and find a valid move. The objective is to combine units to eventually reach 0.\n\nHere's a possible strategy: We should try to combine units to obtain '+number' and '-number' with the same absolute value.\nLooking at the board:\n\n*   We have -9 at index 4.\n*   We can obtain +9 in several ways. For instance, we can apply `floor` to 480.74509080999997 (index 7) which will result in 480. Then we can divide by 7 (index 0) and 9(index 1), which is not what we want.\n\nLet's try another approach.\nIndex 6 has -2. If we square it, which results in 4 using unit with index 2, it become 4. Then use floor operation, which is 4 using unit index 3. It's not useful to reach the final goal 0.\n\nLet's think about eliminating numbers from index 5, -10. Is there a way to get +10?\nFrom index 7, floor operation will get 480. We can't get 10 through multiplication or division with this unit.\n\nLet's try to use `-9` at index 4. What can we do with other operations?\nLet's focus on `480.74509080999997` at index 7.\n\nSince our ultimate goal is to reach 0, let's explore how we can generate equal positive and negative numbers that cancel out. The presence of floor, square, multiplication, and division operations suggests that we can manipulate the numbers to reach a common value.\n\nNotice we have -9 at index 4. Is there a way to generate +9?\nIf we apply square operation at index 2 to `-2` at index 6 we get 4, which is not what we want.\n\nThe number 480.74509080999997 (index 7) is suspicious. It might be possible to manipulate it into an integer after the `floor` operation. If we apply `floor` to it using unit at index 3, we get 480. Now, if we divide this by 7 (index 0), we get 68.57. Then divide by `*9` (index 1), and we get `7.6`.\n\nLet's re-evaluate. We need to find two numbers that add up to zero. We have negative numbers at indices 4, 5 and 6. We need to somehow create positive numbers that match these values in absolute value.\n\nAfter spending some more time, there doesn't seem to be an immediately obvious pair that leads to a quick solution. We will proceed with Floor and index 7 as this will reduce the number and make it manageable.\n\nAnswer: 3 7\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0. I'll analyze the board and try to find a move that gets us closer to that goal.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Prioritize creating opposing values:** Look for combinations that can produce positive and negative numbers with the same absolute value. This is the most direct way to reach 0.\n2. **Handle larger values first:** 480 is a large number. It's likely easier to reduce it through division before attempting to make it a smaller value to cancel.\n3. **Consider square and square root:** These could significantly change the values, but might not be immediately helpful.\n4. **Multiplication can significantly increase the numbers.**\n\nLet's try to use the `\/` operations to reduce the value of 480. However there are no such operations available in the board.\nAlso, we are not allowed to combine two units that do not contain a \"+\" or \"-\" sign. This means 0, 1, 2, 6 can not combine with each other. \n\nLet's examine what we have:\n*7, *9, square, -9, -10, -2, 480.\n\nWe can apply square to 3: square, -9 => 81,-9.\n\nIt is hard to eliminate all the units. \nHowever, we are asked to provide the operation for the current turn.\nGiven the constraints, there aren't many useful moves. The best option seems to be squaring -9.\n\nAnswer: 2 3\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the result is 0. Let's analyze the board:\n\n0: *7\n1: *9\n2: -10\n3: -2\n4: 480\n5: 81\n\nMy strategy will be to try to create positive and negative values that cancel each other out.  I see '480' and potential ways to create '-480'. Let's try something with 4 and 3:\n\nIf I multiply '4' (480) and '3' (-2), then the new value becomes -960\n\nIf I multiply '4' (480) and '2' (-10), then the new value becomes -4800\n\nIf I multiply '0'(*7) and '1'(*9), then the value becomes *63\nIf I multiply '1'(*9) and '5'(81), then the value becomes 729\n\nWhat about starting with '4' 480 and create the -480 value.\n\nIf I divide 480 by 240, it becomes 2.\n\nIt seems like I will need multiple steps before I can cancel the numbers.\n4(*480) and 3(-2) -> -960\n\nI will choose *9 and 81 so the value becomes 729. And '480' \/ 48 = 10. And finally, I can have +10 and -10.\n\nLet me first address the large numbers.\nMultiply 0 and 1: *7 and *9 results in *63\n\nThen, 4 \/ 0: 480 \/ 63 = 7.619\n\nThis seems going to be an infinite loop.\n\nI think I should simplify them first by division.\n4 \/ 5: 480 \/ 81 = 5.92\n\n4 \/ 1: 480 \/ 9 = 53.33\n\n4 \/ 0: 480 \/ 7 = 68.57\n\nHow about multiplying -2 and *7? Then it's -14. Then *9 * -14 = -126\n\nHow about multiplying 81 * 9 = 729?\n\n4 \/ 5 results in 480 \/ 81 = 5.9259. So it doesn't help.\n\nLet's multiply 3 and 0: (-2) * 7 = -14\n1 * 5 = 9 * 81 = 729\n4 = 480\n2 = -10\n\nNow I have -14, 729, 480, -10\n\n4+2 = 480 - 10 = 470.\n\nI will try to get a -480.\n3(-2) * 0(*7) -> -14\n1(*9) * 5(81) -> 729\n\n4(480)\n2(-10)\n\nIt still doesn't work.\nI need one positive and one negative number.\n\nOkay, here's a strategy. I will try to combine such that 2 and 3 will cancel.\nLet's combine 3 and 5. The division results in a small number.\nHow about 3 * 5 = -2 * 81 = -162\n\nLet's find two numbers that are the same, then cancel them.\n\nLet's multiply 0 and 3. *7 and -2.\n3(-2) * 0(*7) = 14\n\n4(480), 5(81), 1(*9), 2(-10)\n\nI'll combine indices 2 and 4. This could be a starting point to getting zero: -10 + 480 = 470.\nIf I can get -470 at the end.\n\nLet's focus on the largest number (480) and the closest negative (-10).\n\n2 4\n\nAnswer: 2 4\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the board's value reaches zero. The available units are:\n\n0: *7\n1: *9\n2: -2\n3: 81\n4: 470\n\nI need to find a sequence of operations that eventually leads to a combined result of 0. It looks like this board is not set up to reach a zero result. I cannot combine numbers in the given board to reach zero. Since the game requests a move regardless, I will just make a move involving the negative number to minimize the overall value.\n\nAnswer: 0 2\n","Let's analyze the board and look for a strategic combination to move towards eliminating units. The goal is to get closer to zero.\n\nWe have:\n* 9\n81\n470\n-14\n\nOne approach could be to try to get close to zero by using the multiplication to make -14 a bigger negative number. However, that would make it harder to combine the numbers to become zero.\nAnother approach is trying to reduce the 470 as this is a large number that's going to be difficult to eliminate. We don't have the tools here to reduce 470 right now.\n\nLet's see if multiplication leads anywhere. The largest number is 81. If we use -14, we don't have operations to make it a factor of 81 to reduce them.\n\nSince none of the units currently produce a 0 when combined, let's consider that multiplication will usually cause the units to grow larger, making it more challenging to eliminate them.\nSince there's no apparent immediate combination which will result in zero. A reasonable approach would be to multiply *9 and -14 to reduce number 470.\nSo let's select unit 0 and unit 3.\n\nAnswer: 0 3\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the total sum is zero. I can only combine a '+number' or '-number' unit with another unit.\n\nLooking at the board:\n0: 81\n1: 470\n2: -126\n\nI need to find a way to combine -126 with either 81 or 470 to get closer to zero. Since 81 is smaller, let's consider using it.\n\nWe could aim to make the 81 equal to 126. 126-81=45 so if we had -45 that would cancel with a step before this. \n\nLet's combine 2 -126 and 1 470. That would make -126 * 470 = -59220. This does not work so let's revert back to the idea of cancelling out with the 81\n\nLet's consider adding -81 instead to the -126 and 81 to the 470. To do that with the current operation types, this is not possible.\n\nLet me try something different. How about I use -126 to cancel with part of 470. What if 126* 470 makes a number, and the resulting number is negative, and I can turn 81 into a positive of equal absolute value.\n\nHowever, the operations allowed are limited (+number,-number) with (*number, \/number, sqrt, square, reciprocal, floor, ceil).\n\nThe easiest approach might be something like this: if I had -470 and added it to the 470, I could reduce the board size to 1 unit (81). So, I could try to create a -470 from -126, 81 etc.\n\nThis approach isn't very helpful. Let's think more clearly. The only way to combine units is to start with a '+' or '-' unit. That limits me to starting with the -126. I need a way to use the 470 and 81 to create something that will cancel -126.\n\nLet's try this. Can I divide 470 by a number to get close to 126?\n470\/126 = 3.73 (approximately).\nCan I multiply 81 by something? 81 * 1.55 = 126 (approximately)\n\nThis doesn't look promising either.\n\nOkay, I need to re-evaluate my strategy. Since my target is 0, I must eventually combine -126 with a +126. I need to find a path using the given operations.\n\nIt seems no immediate combination readily results in 0.\n\nThere seems to be no possible next move.\n\nAnswer: 1 2\n","Okay, I understand the game.

Combining them will result in -2.8232.\n\nGiven all the above analysis, the best move is to combine element 7 and element 8, which is -0.8232 and 0.20976176963403032 respectively. This gives the minimum value (-0.6134382303659697).\n\nAnswer: 7 8\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0. I need to choose two units and indicate their indices. It seems like focusing on creating opposite values is a good strategy.\n\nLet's try to reduce the numbers first. The `ceil` operation does not seem helpful here. The multiplication operations are useful. Let's start by focusing on units `5` and `1`, which will result in `9 * -7 = -63`.\n\nThen, let's operate `2` and `1`. This would give 9*8=72. I want to find a combination resulting in opposite signs and close absolute values.\nUnits 0 and 7 already represent opposite signs. Let's aim for something like 2 and 5, resulting in *8 * -7 = -56. I can also see the relationship between indices `5` and `6` (*-7 and *7). However, operating these two is not optimal.\n\nFocusing on directly canceling is less useful in the start.\n\nLet's consider 1 and 6 to get 9 * 7 = 63. Then combine 5 and 0 to get -2 * -7 = 14.\nI am trying to see some clever strategy but can only think of operating 0 and 1. Let me think about combining 5 and 6 first.\n\nLet's try combining 0 and 1. 0 -2 and 1 9 -> -2+9 = 7\nCombining indices 0 and 1 doesn't seem helpful.\nLet's combine indices 2 and 5 to get *8 * -7 = -56\nLet's combine indices 5 and 6 to get *-7 *7 = -49\n\nLet's look at units 0 and 7: -2 and -0.6134382303659698\n\nI need a clear strategy here. It may involve many steps to get to zero. Let's start by reducing the large numbers using multiplication operations first.\n\nLet's try to use square operation first.\n\nCombine index 1 and index 4 which is 9 and square, which means 9 * 9 = 81. Not useful.\nHow about square root the 9? But I don't have sqrt.\n\nI should make use of * operations. Let me consider index 2 and 5.\n2 and 5 means *8 * -7 = -56\n\nI can use 5 and 6.\n5 6 means *-7 *7 = -49\n\nConsidering the order of operations doesn't really matter here, I want to try a combination that may get it closer to zero. Let's start with operating on the smallest two values in absolute terms, meaning indices 0 and 7:\nAnswer: 0 7\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0. I can only combine a '+number' or '-number' unit with another unit.

Not helpful to reach 0.\n*   **Combining with unit 2 (ceil):** The Ceil operation will round the number, the result would be -2\n*   **Combining with unit 3 (square):** The square operation will calculate the square of this number. The result will be 6.82.\n*   **Combining with unit 4 (\\*-7):** The multiplication operation will result in 18.29406761256179\n*   **Combining with unit 5 (\\*7):** The multiplication operation will result in -18.29406761256179\n*   **Combining with unit 0 (9):** 9 + (-2.61343823036597) = 6.38656176963403.\n\nLet's try ceil first, and after that multiply by 7 and -7.\nFirst, combine unit 6 and 2, the result would be -2.\nThen the board would be:\n0 9\n1 *8\n3 square\n4 *-7\n5 *7\n6 -2\n\nThen, combine unit 6 with 5, the result would be -14.\nThen the board would be:\n0 9\n1 *8\n3 square\n4 *-7\n6 -14\n\nThen, combine unit 6 with 4, the result would be 98.\nThen the board would be:\n0 9\n1 *8\n3 square\n6 98\n\nThis is not a good approach.\n\nLet's consider combining 0 with 1:\n0 9 * 8 = 72\n\nThis doesn't lead us to 0.\n\nLet's analyze again:\n\nI need a positive and negative version of the same number.\nIf I multiply 6 with 5, then I will obtain -18.29406761256179.\nIf I multiply 6 with 4, then I will obtain 18.29406761256179.\n\nCombine 6 and 5: the result is -18.29406761256179\nCombine 6 and 4: the result is 18.29406761256179\nCombine 0 with 6: the result is 0.\n\nSo,\nFirst combine 6 and 5\nSecond combine 6 and 4\nThen combine these two results.\n\nBut I can only perform one operation per turn.\n\nThe key is to create two equal numbers of opposite signs that can be added.\n\nHere's a possible strategy:\n\n1.  Combine 6 (-2.61343823036597) with 5 (*7). This yields -18.29406761256179.\n2. Now consider 0 (9): combine it with reciprocal.

I need to find a combination of two units that will eventually lead to eliminating all units and achieving a final result of 0.\n\nLet's analyze the board:\n\n0: 9\n1: *8\n2: ceil\n3: square\n4: *-7\n5: -18.29406761256179\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **Focus on the target:** The goal is to reach 0. This means we need to find a way to create positive and negative numbers that cancel each other out.\n\n2. **Identify potential candidates:**\n   - We have a negative number: -18.29406761256179 (index 5)\n   - We have a positive number: 9 (index 0)\n\n3. **Look for operations that can link these numbers:**\n   - We also have operations that can transform numbers.\n   - We have multiplication `*8` at index 1 and `*-7` at index 4\n\n4. **Strategize to bring total value close to 0:**\n   - Current total value: `9 + (-18.29406761256179) = -9.29406761256179`\n   - We need positive value approximately equal to 9.29406761256179\n\n5. **Experimenting:**\n   - I can multiply the +9 unit with *8 or *-7 to obtain +72 or -63 respectively, which leads to nowhere, so it's not a valid operation\n   - I can apply the ceil operation to -18.29406761256179, which would result in -18. If I do that, I will need to find +18, so applying square to the number 9 to generate a unit which is 81 is not correct.\n   - There are no square root\/reciprocal operations available, so it is hard to reduce -18.29406761256179 to -9 to cancel out +9 directly.\n\nSince no moves directly lead to the result, I will try to simplify the existing values and see whether it brings a better situation.\n\nHere, I'll choose ceil (index 2) to operate on -18.29406761256179 (index 5), rounding it up to -18.\nThis changes the board values to:\n0: 9\n1: *8\n2: ceil\n3: square\n4: *-7\n5: -18\n\nAnswer: 2 5\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and find a valid move. The goal is to eventually reach 0.\n\nHere's the board:\n0: 9\n1: *8\n2: square\n3: *-7\n4: -18\n\nMy thought process:\n1. I need to find a combination that leads towards zeroing out the numbers.\n2. Directly combining the +9 and -18 isn't ideal yet. I should try to modify them first.\n3. Let's see, I can consider combining *8 and *-7. That might make a larger number I can't get rid of.\n4. Let's analyze index 2, and apply square to index 0: 9 square = 81. That's even further. Applying to index 4, (-18) square = 324.\n5. Applying square to index 3, (*-7) square = *49. I think this is still too complicated.\n\nLet's try this, combining (1) and (3):\n(*8) * (*-7) = *56\n\nNow the board is:\n0: 9\n1: *56\n2: square\n3: -18\n4: square\n\nI have to find ways to make +18, so that I can use the existing -18 to neutralize it.\nHowever, using index 1 and multiplying something will result in a huge number. It is not a good way. \nConsider index 2. This will require square to be performed. 9 square, then * 56?\nIf only I have something divided by 56. That would be great.\n\nHowever, I have found a good solution:\nCombine (0) 9 and (1) *8 to get *72\nCombine (3) *-7 with (4) -18. However, this does not seem to be a good solution.\nCombine (0) 9 square, (2) to get 81. Now (1) *8 =648\nThen (3) *-7, (4) -18. No good.\n\nLet's try combining 1 and 3, to get *8*-7 = *-56. Now my values are 9 and -18, square.\n9 + -18 + something = 0.\n\nAha!\nCombine 0: 9, and 4: -18 to result in -9.\nboard:\n0: -9\n1: *8\n2: square\n3: *-7\n4: -18\nThen combine 0: -9 and 2: square to get: 81\n\nHere is a solution:\nSquare root the value, or reciprocal the value.\nOr maybe I can multiply. Let me think harder.\nCombine 4 (-18) with 1 (*8): -144.\n\nMy current thinking: I need to eliminate all units.\nLet's revisit this. combine 1 and 3, to get *8 and *-7 -> *-56\nboard: 0 9, 1 *-56, 2 square, 4 -18\nI want to make 9, 18.

The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0. I need to choose two units to combine on each turn.\n\nHere's my reasoning for this turn:\n\n1. **Calculate the current values of derived units:**\n    * Unit 2 (square) applied to Unit 0 (9) results in 9 * 9 = 81.  However, this is not how 'square' combines with another unit.  Instead, a numerical value must be present before square, so it can be operated on. In this case, it should be index 0 and 2, 9 square = 81.\n    * Unit 1 (*8) and unit 3 (*-7) can be used to combine. This is because, these two unit are the multiplying factor. In this case, it should be index 1 and 3, which gives 8 * -7 = -56.\n\n2. **Combine units to get 18.**\n    * After the above two steps, we have three units, 81, -56 and -18. It is hard to combine these two into 0.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate units.**\n    * The question doesn't specify which order the unit has to be operated on.\n    * Let's start from -18 from index 4 and combine with *8 from index 1, we have -18 * 8 = -144.\n    * Next we can combine 9 square from index 0 and 2, so we have 9 square = 81.\n    * Then we have *-7, which gives -7\n    * After this, we have -144, 81, -7. This won't be able to get to 0.\n\n4. **Focus on getting equal positive and negative numbers:**\n    * We have -18 at index 4. I need to generate +18 somehow.\n    * if we do 9 square = 81, and then * -7. It is even harder.\n    * if we do * 8 * -7 = -56, which is not good either.\n\n5. **Try square at index 2 with *8 at index 1**\n    * since \"square\" requires a value to operate on. Therefore, square cannot operate with *8\n    * So index 2 square combined with index 0, gives 9 square = 81\n    * Index 1 and index 3 gives, *8 * -7 = -56\n    * Then we have -18. it seems impossible to combine all these three.\n\nLet's try to get 18 from other units:\n-18 can be obtained from -7, *8, and square. This seems impossible.\n\nAfter more attempts to combine the units, I noticed the combination of index 1 and 3 is promising.\nindex 1 *8\nindex 3 *-7\nindex 1 * index 3 = -56\n\nSince none of the unit square root, reciprocal, floor and ceil can be combined with other unit, I will focus on + and -\nIt seems I am not able to eliminate all units with the above operations.\n\nAnswer: 1 3\n","Okay, I understand the game. The goal is to combine units until the final result is 0. Here's my thought process for this board:\n\nCurrently, the board contains:\n0: 9\n1: *8\n2: square\n3: *-7\n4: -18\n\nHere's a possible strategy:\n1. Apply the \"square\" operation to 9, to get 81. This doesn't directly help us get to zero. So, we need to change other units and seek opportunities\n2. Combine 1 (*8) and 3 (*-7) to get *(-56).\n3. Now, multiply 9 *(-56) = -504.\n4. If we \"square\" the first element which is 9, we get 81. Then square root 81 and we get 9 again. However, it seems like we do not want to simply operate on the same element several times.\n\nAnother strategy:\nFocus on -18 in index 4, and try to eliminate it using some positive number.\nFirst let's multiply 9 (*8) which gives *72. This is not beneficial since it doesn't allow us to use the -18.\n\nLet us operate *-7 and square. If we calculate the square of -7, it becomes 49. However, if square is operating on the board index. 9 square results to 81.\n\nLet us multiply *8 by 9. That gives 72.\nLet us multiply *-7 by -18 to get +126. 72+126 = 198.\nThat still does not give us the option of eliminating this completely.\n\nFinal approach: I need to create +18 to cancel out the -18.  If I take the square root of 9 it will be 3. It won't help here.\nMultiply 9 by *8 to have 72.\n\nCombine *(-7) and -18 by multiplying: -7*-18=126. We don't have -126.\nAlso, it does not make much sense.\n\nIf we square 9, we get 81. Still not helpful.\nSince we want to reach to 0, and there are multiplication operations, the only way to get zero is that eventually some element itself is zero.\n\nHowever, I'll try to combine the two multiplication operations.\n1 3\n\nAnswer: 1 3\n","Okay, let's analyze the board and find a way to eliminate all units and achieve a final result of 0.\n\nCurrent board state:\n0: 9\n1: *8\n2: square\n3: *-7\n4: -18\n\nStrategy:\n1.

So let's consider if we can add to -18 or find a way to get a positive 18.\n\nIf we multiply 81 by -7, we get -567. Then we multiply the result by 8 we get an even bigger number.\n\nLet's try to find a different strategy. We could perform a multiplication of *8 and *-7, yielding a new unit: *(-56).

The target is to eliminate units to reach a net 0. We need to look for creating additive inverse pairs. Since the target is zero, we want to turn some of them into their additive inverse and combine them. We have -18 and 81.

Since we have -18 already, it's good to try to create +18.\n\nHere's a possible move that creates 18:\n* Multiply 0 and 1: 8 * -7 = -56\nThen this value could be used in some other way. But it seems unlikely to result in an easy +18.\nHow about taking the sqrt of 81, which is 9, and then multiplying it with 2 to get 18.\n\nAnother approach is to obtain 18 using unit 0 and 1. However, this is very difficult.\n\nI think a better approach is to use 3 and the operations with 0 and 1 to get 18. Then we can simply cancel out with the value in 2.\n\n*   The square root of 81 is 9.\n*   9 times 2 would be 18.\n\nHere's my move:\n1.

Then we need a +56 to cancel with *-56. Currently we have 63, so if we perform a floor, ceil or sqrt operation on 63, we won't get 56. But If we first perform *8 * -7 = -56 and then combine it with a new +56, the final answer will be zero. However, this requires a further step, and it is not allowed to create new units according to the game rules. Therefore, a simple combination between the available units cannot bring the result to 0.\n\nIs there any way to combine multiplication and number unit? It can be done, but it won't make the final result to 0 directly. Since we need to choose two units to output their indices, let's select the two multiplication operators. It might be a start, or at least output a valid answer based on the available choices.\n\nAnswer: 0 1\n","Let's analyze the board:\n- Unit 0: *8 (multiplication by 8)\n- Unit 1: *-7 (multiplication by -7)\n- Unit 2: 63 (the number 63)\n\nThe goal is to combine these units to achieve a final result of 0. One possible strategy is:\n\n1. Multiply 63 by -7: 63 * -7 = -441\n2. Multiply the result -441 by 8. -441 * 8 = -3528.\n\nThis approach doesn't lead to 0, and it involves chaining multiplication. We need to introduce addition and subtraction.\n\nLet's consider multiplying 63 by *8 which result in 504. We can achieve 0 if *-7 will lead to -504. That requires that the input to *-7 needs to be equal to 504\/(-7) which result in -72\n\nLet's try another approach:\n- combine the *8 and *-7 first:  *8 * -7 = *-56\nNow we have the units:\n0: *-56\n1: 63\n\nWe need the result of 63 * -56 to be 0. That doesn't work.\n\nLet's revisit our first approach.\n1. Combine *8 and *-7 to get *-56 (multiply by -56)\n2. Now we have *-56 and 63.\n3. If 63 were -63, and we multiply by -56, that doesn't work.\n\nLet's rethink this. We need a +number and a -number of equal magnitude. Multiplication alone won't get us there. There's no straightforward way to combine these to get 0. It looks like we can't eliminate all units.\n\nHowever, based on the game's rules, we must pick two units. With the current board, one potential operation could be multiplying the number 63 by 8 and then by -7.\n\nI'll combine index 0 and 2 first.\nAnswer: 0 2\n","We have two units: `*-7` and `504`. Our goal is to eliminate all units, meaning the final combined result is 0. We need to find a way to combine these two units to achieve a result of 0.
