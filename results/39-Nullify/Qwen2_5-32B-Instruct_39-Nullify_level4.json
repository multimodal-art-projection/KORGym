To reach 0, we need to add 96 to -96. However, since we only have 1.0, it's clear that direct addition or subtraction won't work. Instead, we can consider operations like reciprocal or square, but given the simplicity and the goal to reach zero, it seems the most straightforward way is to reconsider our initial approach.\n\nSince the only numbers we have are -48, 2, and 1.0, and considering the operations available, the most straightforward way to make the total sum zero would be to try and use division or multiplication effectively. Given the presence of 1.0, we might think of it as a neutral element in some operations, but here it seems more practical to multiply -48 by 2 first, then find a way to counteract -96.\n\nHowever, without additional units, achieving exactly zero directly from the current set seems impossible without using an operation that could transform one of the units into a form that would allow for cancellation with the others.

We have division and multiplication operations available, which can help manipulate the numbers effectively.\n\nOne approach is to use the division operation first to reduce one of the larger numbers. Since 33.3333 divided by 10 equals 3.3333, we can use the division operation on 33.3333 to make it smaller.

To reach zero, we need to add 1.0 to -5.0. However, since we cannot directly add these without more operations, we must reevaluate the initial steps.\n\nInstead, we could try another combination:\n- Use *-3 on 5 to get -15.0\n- Then divide -15.0 by 10 to get -1.5\n- Finally, add -1.5 to 1.0 and 33.3333 to eliminate all units.\n\nBut to follow the instructions strictly and provide an immediate step:\n\nThe best immediate action would be to apply the division operation (\/10) on the larger number (33.3333).

This operation yields 400, which seems to complicate rather than simplify the situation.\n\nHowever, if we consider the goal of simplifying to zero, combining `-7` (unit 1) with `0.2` (unit 2) using division (\/0.2) results in -35. This doesn't immediately help but can be part of a longer strategy.\n\nSince direct combinations aren't immediately leading us to a simple path to zero, and aiming for simplicity and immediate effect, combining `-7` (unit 1) with `1.0` (unit 3) doesn't make sense as it doesn't simplify.\n\nTherefore, considering the aim to eliminate units and simplify towards zero, the best immediate move appears to be combining `-7` (unit 1) with `0.2` (unit 2) using division to start forming a base for further simplification.\n\nAnswer: 1 2","Given the game objective to eliminate all units, meaning the final combined result should be 0, we need to look at the available units and think about how they can be combined to achieve this goal.\n\nThe units available on the board are:\n0: 80\n1: 1.0\n2: -6.8\n\nSince the game involves combining units, let's consider what combinations could lead us towards our goal of achieving a zero-sum state. \n\nWe can start by looking at the possibility of combining units 0 and 2 because their signs are opposite.

Combining 34 (\/position 4) with \/-3 (\/position 0) would give us -11.33..., but since we aim to eventually reach 0, let's choose an operation that might simplify future steps.\n\nA better approach might be to use the division operation on a smaller number to keep the board manageable.

Since 3 * -0.3333333333333333 = -1, we can use the number 5 to get closer to our goal. However, the exact multiplication isn't available directly, but we can use division to manipulate it.\n\nA strategic move would be to divide 5 by 3 to get approximately 1.6666666666666667, then multiply this by -0.3333333333333333 to get -0.5555555555555556, which isn’t ideal but showcases the process.\n\nHowever, without more specific operations or additional numbers, the most direct path to elimination given the current units involves looking for immediate cancellation or manipulation towards that end.\n\nGiven the units present, the best immediate step would be to attempt a multiplication that brings us closer to an easily cancellable state.

Therefore, our first step should be to combine units 2 and 3 to get 6.\n\nHowever, since the aim is to provide the operation for the current turn, and given the available units, the most immediate action towards achieving the goal would be to use the floor function on one of the non-integer numbers to simplify the board.

One straightforward way is to use the '0' unit (index 4) since combining any number with it will result in that number itself, but more importantly, combining any operation with '0' can often simplify our path to achieving the goal.\n\nHowever, given the current setup, a more direct approach would be to combine numbers that might lead to a neutralization effect. Since there's already a '0', we can aim to make use of it indirectly by neutralizing other numbers through operations.\n\nLooking at the numbers available, combining `-9` (index 0) with `5` (index 5) seems like a logical step because it results in `-4`, moving us closer to a strategy that could eventually reach zero.\n\nThus, the operation for this turn would be to combine `-9` with `5`.\n\nAnswer: 0 5","Given the current game board and the objective to eliminate all units by reaching a final combined result of 0, we need to look at the available units and think about which operations can lead us towards this goal.\n\nThe board is as follows:\n0 floor\n1 -56\n2 -0.7957000000000001\n3 0\n4 -4\n\nFirstly, we notice that unit 3 is already 0, which means it does not contribute to any combination that aims to reach 0 as an end result since adding or subtracting 0 doesn't change the value.\n\nNext, let's consider potential combinations:\n- Combining -56 (unit 1) with -4 (unit 4) would yield a non-zero result, so this isn't immediately useful for our goal.\n- Unit 2 (-0.7957000000000001) is a decimal, which complicates direct elimination unless combined with a reciprocal or another specific operation that could simplify it to a form that can eventually lead to 0.\n\nConsidering the available operations and aiming to create a path to zero, one effective strategy could involve using the floor operation (unit 0). Applying the floor operation to a number rounds it down to the nearest integer. However, without a positive or negative number that could cancel out another to make 0, we might need to think about creating such a scenario through combination.\n\nGiven the options, a promising move might be to use the floor operation on unit 2 (-0.7957000000000001) to transform it into -1, which could then potentially be used to cancel out another unit later on.\n\nThus, a strategic first step could be applying the floor operation to unit 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","To eliminate all units, we need to strategically combine them so that the final result is 0.

However, we notice that the unit at position 1 is already 0, which means it doesn't contribute to any calculation but can serve as a placeholder or a neutral element.\n\nSince our goal is to make the entire board sum up to 0, and given the current setup, the best immediate step would be to try and combine the units in such a way that they cancel each other out or lead towards a state where we can easily reach 0.
