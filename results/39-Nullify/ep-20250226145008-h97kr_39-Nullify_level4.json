If we square the result (using the unit at index 2, square), \\((153.4813)^{2}=23556.41\\), which makes the value even larger.\n\nLet's try a different combination. We know that we have negative numbers and multiplication operations.\n\nIf we take the unit at index 5 (4) and the unit at index 1 (*7), we get \\(4\\times7 = 28\\)\n\nThen if we square it using the unit at index 2 (square), we have \\(28^{2}=784\\)\n\nThis still doesn't seem to be a good path to reach 0.\n\nLet's consider a combination that can balance positive and negative values.\n\nIf we take the unit at index 5 (4) and the unit at index 2 (square), we get \\(4^{2}=16\\)\n\nThen if we multiply it by the unit at index 3 (*9), we have \\(16\\times9 = 144\\)\n\nWe have negative numbers on the board.

Then we can start to subtract the negative - numbers.\nLet's first perform the multiplications:\nMultiply the number at index 0 (21.9259) with the number at index 1 (*7). The result of \\(21.9259\\times7 = 153.4813\\).\nThen multiply this result with the number at index 2 (*9). The result of \\(153.4813\\times9=1381.3317\\).\nNow, we have a large positive number.

We want to get a final result of 0.\nIf we multiply the numbers in indices 0 and 1, we have \\((-7)\\times7=-49\\).\nLet's try to combine other numbers to balance this result.\nIf we take the number at index 2 and multiply it by the number at index 3, \\(0.20976176963403032\\times72\\approx15.102847413650183\\). This doesn't seem to lead to a good combination.\nLet's consider combining the multiplication operations first. The numbers at index 0 and 1 are both multiplication - related units. When we multiply \\(-7\\) and \\(7\\), we get \\(- 49\\).\nNow, if we square the number at index 4 (\\(4.0\\)), \\(4^2 = 16\\). And if we multiply it by the number at index 5 (\\(1\\)), the result is still \\(16\\). But this combination also doesn't seem to lead to a way to eliminate all units.\nLet's try to combine the two multiplication units. When we combine the units at index 0 and 1, we perform the multiplication operation \\((-7)\\times7=-49\\).\nWe need to keep combining other units to get to 0.\nLet's try to use all the units step - by - step. First, combine the multiplication units at index 0 and 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","To start eliminating units, we can try to use the multiplication operations to change the values of the numbers. Let's multiply the number in index 2 with the multiplication unit at index 0.\n\nThe multiplication of the unit at index 0 (* - 7) and the unit at index 2 (0.20976176963403032) will give - 7 * 0.20976176963403032 = - 1.4683323874382122. This is a step towards combining and potentially eliminating units.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","We can first multiply the number in index 0 with the number in index 1. The operation in index 0 is multiplication by 7, and the number in index 1 is 72. So \\(7\\times72 = 504\\).\nThen we can combine the result with the number in index 2. Let's continue to deal with the subsequent numbers to try to get the final result of 0.\n\nIf we first perform the operation between index 0 and index 1:\nThe result of \\(0 *7\\) and \\(1 72\\) is \\(7\\times72=504\\).\nThen we can try to use other numbers to neutralize this result.\n\nLet's start with the first step of operation. We choose to operate on the units at index 0 and index 1.\n\nAnswer: 0 1","1. First, understand the rules and the game board:\n   - The goal is to eliminate all units by combining them to get a final result of 0.\n   - The units on the board are:\n     - Unit 0: 4.0\n     - Unit 1: 1\n     - Unit 2: - 1.4683323874382121\n     - Unit 3: 504\n2. Analyze possible combinations:\n   - If we combine unit 0 (4.0) and unit 1 (1), we can perform an addition operation \\(4.0 + 1=5\\). This doesn't seem to be a step towards getting 0 quickly.\n   - If we combine unit 0 (4.0) and unit 2 (-1.4683323874382121), we get \\(4.0+( - 1.4683323874382121)=2.5316676125617879\\). This also doesn't seem to lead to 0 easily.\n   - If we combine unit 1 (1) and unit 2 (-1.4683323874382121), we get \\(1+( - 1.4683323874382121)= - 0.4683323874382121\\).\n   - However, if we consider that we want to balance out larger numbers, we can try to combine unit 0 (4.0) and unit 3 (504). We can think of it as an addition problem. If we assume we can later balance out the sum. But if we first combine unit 1 and unit 3, we get \\(1 + 504=505\\), which is even larger and harder to balance.\n   - A more strategic approach is to first try to combine the smaller - valued numbers. Let's combine unit 0 (4.0) and unit 2 (-1.4683323874382121).\n   - The operation of combining these two units will give us a new value that might be easier to work with in subsequent combinations to reach 0.\n\n3. Output the answer:\n   - The two unit indices for the operation in the current turn are 0 and 2.\n\nAnswer: 0 2","There is no information indicating which units can be combined based on the given board and rules.

This also doesn't seem promising.\nLet's consider combining the unit at index 5 (12) and the unit at index 4 (-6). The result of 12 + (-6) is 6.\nThen, if we combine the result 6 with the unit at index 0 (-10), we get 6+(-10) = -4.\nNow, if we combine -4 with the unit at index 1 (\/6), we get \\(-4\/6\\approx - 0.67\\).

If we consider the combination of - 10 and \/6:\n   - The result of \\(-10\\div6\\approx - 1.67\\). This doesn't seem to be a step towards eliminating all units effectively at this stage.\n2. Let's consider the square operation. If we apply the square operation (unit 2) to 7.4495 (unit 3):\n   - \\(7.4495^{2}=7.4495\\times7.4495 = 55.49505025\\). This also doesn't lead us directly to the goal of getting 0.\n3. Now, if we combine - 10 (unit 0) and 6 (unit 4), we get \\(-10 + 6=-4\\). This is also not the best move.\n4. Let's consider dividing 6 (unit 4) by 6 (using the \/6 operation of unit 1). The result of \\(6\\div6 = 1\\).\n   - Now we can think about how to use the remaining units to cancel out.\n   - If we combine - 10 (unit 0) with the result of \\(6\\div6 = 1\\), we get \\(-10+1=-9\\). This is not good.\n5. However, if we combine - 10 (unit 0) and \/6 (unit 1), we get \\(-10\\div6\\approx - 1.67\\).\n   - If we then consider the 7.4495 (unit 3), we are still far from 0.\n6. Let's first use the \/6 operation on 6. The operation between unit 1 and unit 4 gives \\(6\\div6 = 1\\).\n   - Then we can combine - 10 (unit 0) and the result of the operation between unit 1 and unit 4. But a better first - step is to combine the \/6 (unit 1) and 6 (unit 4) because it simplifies one of the non - trivial operations.\n\nSo, the operation for the current turn is to combine the units at indices 1 and 4.\n\nAnswer: 1 4","First, we analyze the possible operations on the given board.\nWe have a negative number - 10 at index 0, a square operation at index 1, a number 7.4495 at index 2, and a number 1.0 at index 3.\nIf we use the square operation on - 10 (index 0), we get \\((-10)^2=100\\).

Performing the square - root operation on 110.1852 gives approximately 10.5.\n    - Then, if we take the floor of this result (using the unit at index 1), `floor(10.5)` gives 10.\n    - We have a unit at index 4 which is `-10`. When we combine the result 10 (from the previous operations) with - 10, we get \\(10+( - 10)=0\\).\n    - And we still have the unit `-7` left. But if we don't perform the operations in this order, it will be difficult to eliminate all units.\n\nSo, the first operation we should do is to apply the square - root operation on 110.1852. The indices of these two units are 2 and 3.\n\nAnswer: 2 3","First, let's analyze the possible operations.\nIf we use the `floor` operation on the number `10.496913832169911`, we get `10` (since the floor of a number rounds it down to the nearest integer).\nThe `floor` operation is at index 1 and the number `10.496913832169911` is at index 3. After applying the `floor` operation on the number at index 3, we get a new unit of `10`.\nWe already have a unit `-10` at index 2. If we combine the result of the floor operation (new `10`) with `-10`, they will cancel each other out (because \\(10+(- 10)=0\\)).\nSo the first step is to perform the floor operation on the number at index 3 using the `floor` operation at index 1.\nThe operation for the current turn is to use the unit at index 1 on the unit at index 3.\n\nAnswer: 1 3","We can see that unit 1 is -10 and unit 2 is 10.
