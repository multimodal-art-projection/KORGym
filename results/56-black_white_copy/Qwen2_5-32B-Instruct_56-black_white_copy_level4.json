This can be done with two 'column' operations.\n   \n2. **Adjust specific rows or diagonals**: After turning columns 1 and 4 black, we need to adjust some specific rows or diagonals to match the remaining part of the target pattern. Rows 2, 5, and 6 have black pieces in positions that don't align with the columns already turned black, so we might need to use diagonal operations to correct these.\n\nBased on this analysis, here's a possible sequence of operations to achieve the target pattern:\n\n1.

Let's analyze the target pattern:\n\n```\nBWWWBW\nWWWWWW\nBWBWWW\nBBWWWW\nBWWWWW\nBWWWWW\n```\n\nThe goal is to use at most three operations to match this pattern. Given the constraints, we can see that changing rows or columns extensively might not be efficient. Instead, focusing on diagonals might provide a more direct path to achieving the desired pattern.\n\nLet's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Diagonal Operation ('diagonal_black')**: We notice that there are several 'B's that align along a diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right. Specifically, if we choose the diagonal that starts from the bottom-left corner and moves towards the top-right, we can cover most of the 'B's in the target pattern. This would be the diagonal starting from the bottom-left corner up to the third cell from the right on the top row. This diagonal operation will turn these positions to black.\n\n2. **Row Operation ('row')**: After performing the diagonal operation, we notice that the first row still needs one more 'B' at the first position, which is not covered by the diagonal. We can achieve this by turning the entire first row to white and then performing the diagonal operation again, but since we have only three operations, we must optimize. Instead, we can directly change the first row to include the 'B' by setting it to white and then manually placing the 'B'.\n\nHowever, considering the limit of operations and the pattern, the optimal approach seems to be:\n\n1. Perform a 'diagonal_black' operation on the diagonal that covers the majority of 'B's.\n2. Use a 'row' operation to correct any discrepancies in rows.\n\nBased on the analysis, the operations can be:\n\n1. `['diagonal_black', 0]` - This will turn the diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the top-right, covering most of the 'B's.\n2. `['row', 0]` - To adjust the first row to have a 'B' at the start.\n\nThis approach uses two operations, which is within the limit of three operations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 0], ['row', 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Given the complexity and the limit of three operations, it's important to focus on areas that can be changed efficiently with the available operations.\n\nLooking at the target pattern, we notice that the majority of the board is white except for specific areas that are black. To minimize the number of operations, we should focus on changing large areas with fewer operations. Here, we can see that changing entire rows or columns might not be efficient since there are mixed colors in almost every row and column. However, focusing on diagonals could be more effective because they can cover multiple cells with a single operation.\n\nGiven the target pattern, let's consider the following operations:\n\n1. Perform a 'diagonal_black' operation on the diagonal that goes from the bottom left to the top right, passing through positions like (5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4), (0,5). This will turn the necessary cells black along this diagonal.\n2. Perform a 'diagonal_white' operation on the diagonal that goes from the top left to the bottom right, passing through positions like (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5). This will ensure that the cells along this diagonal remain white, which matches the target pattern.\n3. Finally, perform a 'column' operation on column 5 (index 5) to turn all pieces in this column black. This is necessary because the last column has more black pieces than white ones.\n\nThus, the operations would be:\n1. ['diagonal_black', 5]\n2. ['diagonal_white', 0]\n3. ['line', 5]\n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 5], ['diagonal_white', 0], ['line', 5]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Initially, all cells contain white pieces. You can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Row operation (row): Turns all pieces in the selected row to white.\n2. Column operation ('line'): Turns all pieces in the selected column to black.\n3. Diagonal operation ('diagonal_black') (from bottom-left to top-right): Turns all pieces on the selected diagonal to black.\n4. Diagonal operation ('diagonal_white') (from top-left to bottom-right): Turns all pieces on the selected diagonal to white.\n\nGiven a target pattern and a limited number of operations, your task is to achieve the target pattern starting from an all-white board.  \nOutput your solution as a list in the format '[[operation_name, position], ...]',e.g.'Answer: [['row', 3], ['line', 0], ['diagonal_black', 6], ...]'\nTarget Board:\nWWWWWB\nWWWWWB\nWWWWBB\nWWWBWB\nWWBWBB\nWBWBWB\nLimited Number:\n3\n","epoch":1,"seed":49,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
