Here's the detailed explanation and solution:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Analyze the Target Board\n\nThe target board is:\n```\nWWWWBW\nWBBWBB\nWWWWBW\nBWWBBW\nWBBWBW\nWBWWBB\n```\n\n- `W` represents a white piece.\n- `B` represents a black piece.\n  \nWe need to figure out which operations will turn the all-white board into this target configuration.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strategy Based on Operations\n\n**Operation Overview:**\n- A **row operation ('row')** turns the entire row to white, erasing all black cells in that row.\n- A **column operation ('line')** turns the entire column to black.\n- A **diagonal_black ('diagonal_black')** operation turns all cells on the bottom-left to top-right diagonal to black.\n- A **diagonal_white ('diagonal_white')** operation turns all cells on the top-left to bottom-right diagonal to white.\n\nWe will carefully analyze how to selectively apply these operations to match the target board while limiting the number of operations to the allowed maximum (8 in this case).\n\n---\n\n### 3. Solution Construction\n\n#### Step-by-Step Plan:\n1. All rows and columns initially start as all `W`. To efficiently create the target pattern, we will focus on applying column and diagonal operations.\n2. I'll examine the rows top to bottom and analyze where the black cells (`B`) appear.\n\n---\n\n#### Initial Observations:\n\n- Column operations (`line`) are the most efficient way to toggle entire columns to black. Therefore, I notice the pattern:\n  - Column 4 and Column 5 must change from white (`W`) to black (`B`).\n  \n- At some positions, additional fine-tuning is required using diagonal operations.\n\n#### Operations to Apply:\n\n1. **Turn Column 4 (0-indexed) to black using `'line'`:**\n   - This will turn all pieces in column 4 to black.\n  \n2. **Turn Column 5 (0-indexed) to black using `'line'`:**\n   - This will turn all pieces in column 5 to black.\n\n3.

There are black (B) pieces in specific places in the columns:\n   - Column 1 (0-indexed): Row 0 has B.\n   - Column 2 (0-indexed): Rows 1, 2, and 4 have Bs.\n\n2. The black pieces align diagonally (from bottom-left (row 4, column 2) to top-right (row 0, column 0)). This can be addressed using a `'diagonal_black'` operation.\n\n3. To address the rest of the cells effectively, we can combine column operations and other diagonal operations if necessary.\n\n### Plan\nConsidering the limit of 5 operations, we aim for an efficient solution:\n1. Apply `'diagonal_black'` on the bottom-left to top-right diagonal (index 3).\n2. Apply line\/column operations to fine-tune columns with black pieces.\n\n### Solution\nBased on the observations:\n1. Perform a `'diagonal_black'` operation at index 3. This operation will set all pieces on the diagonal from bottom-left to top-right to black.\n2. Perform `'line'` operations for columns that still have disproportionately many white pieces where black pieces are needed:\n   - `'line', 1`: This will make all pieces in Column 1 black.\n\nNo further operations are needed because all black pieces on the board are covered.\n\n### Answer\nThe final list of operations is:\n```\n[['diagonal_black', 3], ['line', 1]]\n```\n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 3], ['line', 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
