The key is to identify operations that efficiently cover the maximum number of target black (B) cells while minimizing overlaps that would require additional corrections.\n\n### Analysis of Target Board\nThe target board has 13 B cells. By examining the positions of these B cells, we notice that many of them lie on specific diagonals (bottom-left to top-right, defined by \\( r + c = d \\)), which can be efficiently covered using the `diagonal_black` operation.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Diagonal \\( r + c = 5 \\)**: This diagonal includes cells (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0), all of which are B in the target.

Using a column operation (`line`) on column 3 sets all cells in column 3 to black initially. \n3. **Row Operations for Rows 4 and 5**: To correct column 3 in rows 4-5 (which need to be white), we use row operations (`row`) on rows 4 and 5.

(0,2) and (1,1) are target B positions, while (2,0) is not but can be fixed later.\n3. **Diagonal_black (10)**: This diagonal (i+j=10) includes only (5,5), which is a target B position.\n4. **Diagonal_white (2)**: This diagonal (i-j=2) includes (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), (5,3). (2,0) was set to B by the previous diagonal_black (2) operation and needs to be turned back to white. (5,3) was set to B by the column operation (line, 3) but is not a target B position, so it is turned to white.\n5. **Row Operation (row, 4)**: This operation turns all cells in row 4 to white.

Applying a diagonal_black operation on this diagonal will set these cells to black.\n\n### Verification\n- **Column 5 (line 5)**: Sets all cells in column 5 to black, covering (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5).\n- **Diagonal 6 (diagonal_black 6)**: Sets cells (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) to black (since \\(i + j = 6\\)).\n- **Diagonal 8 (diagonal_black 8)**: Sets cells (4,4), (5,3) to black (since \\(i + j = 8\\)).\n\nAll operations combined cover all black cells in the target board while leaving white cells unchanged.\n\nAnswer: [['line', 5], ['diagonal_black', 6], ['diagonal_black', 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Initially, all cells contain white pieces. You can perform the following operations:\n\n1. Row operation (row): Turns all pieces in the selected row to white.\n2. Column operation ('line'): Turns all pieces in the selected column to black.\n3. Diagonal operation ('diagonal_black') (from bottom-left to top-right): Turns all pieces on the selected diagonal to black.\n4. Diagonal operation ('diagonal_white') (from top-left to bottom-right): Turns all pieces on the selected diagonal to white.\n\nGiven a target pattern and a limited number of operations, your task is to achieve the target pattern starting from an all-white board.  \nOutput your solution as a list in the format '[[operation_name, position], ...]',e.g.'Answer: [['row', 3], ['line', 0], ['diagonal_black', 6], ...]'\nTarget Board:\nWWWWWB\nWWWWWB\nWWWWBB\nWWWBWB\nWWBWBB\nWBWBWB\nLimited Number:\n3\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
