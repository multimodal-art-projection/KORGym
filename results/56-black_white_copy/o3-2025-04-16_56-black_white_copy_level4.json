Diagonal operation ('diagonal_white') (from top-left to bottom-right): Turns all pieces on the selected diagonal to white.\n\nGiven a target pattern and a limited number of operations, your task is to achieve the target pattern starting from an all-white board.  \nOutput your solution as a list in the format '[[operation_name, position], ...]',e.g.'Answer: [['row', 3], ['line', 0], ['diagonal_black', 6], ...]'\nTarget Board:\nWWWWWB\nWWWWWB\nWWWWBB\nWWWBWB\nWWBWBB\nWBWBWB\nLimited Number:\n3\n","epoch":1,"have_image":false,"base64_image":""}
