One solution is as follows. Note that the bottom‐left-to–top‐right diagonal (diagonal_black) always flips all cells for which row+column equals the chosen number, and the top–left-to–bottom–right diagonal (diagonal_white) flips all cells for which row–column equals the chosen number.\n\nLooking at the target board:\n Row0: W W W B B W\n Row1: W W W B W W\n Row2: W B B W W W\n Row3: B B W W W B\n Row4: B W W W B W\n Row5: W W W B W B\n\nWe can “create” most black pieces by “painting” three key diagonals black. In particular, observe that:\n• Cells with row+column = 4 are exactly {(0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0)} which we want black.\n• Cells with row+column = 8 are exactly {(3,5), (4,4), (5,3)} matching the target.\n• Many remaining black cells are in the diagonal row+column = 3. That diagonal would include {(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)}. The target wants (0,3), (2,1) and (3,0) black, but (1,2) is supposed to be white. So we can use diagonal_black with parameter 3 and then “fix” the extra black at (1,2).\n\nAfter these three operations, the board (starting all white) becomes:\n Row0: _ _ _ B (from 3) B (from 4) _\n Row1: _ _ B (from 3; note extra) B (from 4) _\n Row2: _ B (from 3) B (from 4) _ _\n Row3: B (from 3) B (from 4) _ _ _ B (from 8)\n Row4: B (from 4) _ _ _ B (from 8 remains white here until fixed)  [actually (4,0) from op1 and (4,4) from op2]\n Row5: _ _ _ B (from 8) _ _\n\nNow we need to fix two details with two remaining moves:\n1. The unwanted black at (1,2) can be “erased” (turned white) by using a diagonal_white op. Note that the top–left-to–bottom–right diagonal for (1,2) is the set of cells where row–column = 1–2 = –1. That diagonal is {(0,1), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5)}; all of these should be white according to the target.\n2. Finally the cell (5,5) is still white but must be black. Notice that the bottom–left to top–right diagonal with row+column = 10 contains only (5,5) in a 6×6 board. A diagonal_black op on parameter 10 will convert (5,5) to black.\n\nThus a valid 5–move solution is:\n 1. diagonal_black on parameter 4\n 2. diagonal_black on parameter 8\n 3. diagonal_black on parameter 3\n 4. diagonal_white on parameter –1\n 5. diagonal_black on parameter 10\n\nIn the required format the answer is:\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 4], ['diagonal_black', 8], ['diagonal_black', 3], ['diagonal_white', -1], ['diagonal_black', 10]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

So one diagonal_black operation with parameter 2 will cover these cells.\n• The target requires column 3 to be black in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 – so we use a column (“line”) operation on column 3. (This unfortunately paints row4 col3 black too.)\n• Row 4 must be entirely white except its column 5. Therefore, we fix row 4 by an operation “row 4” (which sets the whole row to white, undoing the unwanted black at col3).\n• Finally, column 5 must be entirely black.

One way to do it is as follows:\n\n• Notice that the cells (2,5), (3,4), (4,3) and (5,2) all lie on the same anti‐diagonal (their row+column equals 7). So a diagonal_black operation on diagonal 7 will set these four cells to black.\n\n• The cell (0,0) is alone (its row+column is 0) so we can turn it black with a diagonal_black operation on diagonal 0.\n\n• The cell (5,4) is not “covered” so far. It lies on the anti‐diagonal for which row+column = 9. However, doing a diagonal_black on 9 would also color (4,5) black even though we want row4 to have only the cell (4,3) in black. This extra “accident” can be fixed by first applying diagonal_black 9 to get (5,4) black and then “cleaning” row4 (which currently would have an extra black at col5) by using a row operation on row4 to force all its pieces white. But that row op would also remove the black (4,3) that we need. Fortunately, if we then re‐apply the diagonal_black 7 (which covers (4,3)), the row4 will again get the desired black at column 3 while (4,5) remains white because row4’s op came later. \n\nThus a valid sequence is:\n\n1. Use diagonal_black on diagonal 9. This sets (4,5)and (5,4) black.\n2. Use row on row4. This turns the entire row4 white (fixing the unwanted (4,5)) but also erases (4,3) which we need.

Notice that in every row the first three cells must eventually be black. A very efficient way to get that is to “paint” the entire first three columns black by doing a column operation (\"line\") on columns 0, 1, and 2. This changes every cell in those columns to black while leaving the rest white.\n\nLet’s see the board after these three operations:\n • For every row, columns 0, 1, 2 become black.\n • The remaining columns 3, 4, 5 stay white.\n\nThat produces:\n Row 0: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B W W W)\n Row 1: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B W W B)\n Row 2: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B W B W)\n Row 3: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B B W W)\n Row 4: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B W W W)\n Row 5: B B B W W W  (Target: B B B W W W)\n\nNow, aside from the columns already black (0,1,2), we only need to blacken three extra pieces:\n • Row 1, column 5\n • Row 2, column 4\n • Row 3, column 3\n\nA clever observation is that these three cells all fall on the same bottom‐left to top‐right diagonal. For a 6×6 board (with row and column indices 0–5), the cells on a diagonal defined by constant r + c = S share a common sum S. Here:\n – (row 1, col 5): 1 + 5 = 6\n – (row 2, col 4): 2 + 4 = 6\n – (row 3, col 3): 3 + 3 = 6\n\nMoreover, if we list all cells with r + c = 6, we get:\n (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) and (5,1).\nNotice that (4,2) and (5,1) already are black from the column operations, so applying one diagonal operation will set (1,5), (2,4), (3,3) to black (and leave the rest as black naturally).\n\nThus, the fourth operation is to apply a \"diagonal_black\" operation on the diagonal with r + c = 6.\n\nAfter applying these 4 operations, the board becomes exactly:\n Row 0: B B B W W W  \n Row 1: B B B W W B  \n Row 2: B B B W B W  \n Row 3: B B B B W W  \n Row 4: B B B W W W  \n Row 5: B B B W W W  \n\nwhich matches the target board.\n\nThe operations in order are:\n 1. Apply \"line\" on column 0.\n 2. Apply \"line\" on column 1.\n 3. Apply \"line\" on column 2.\n 4.

Notice that every row in the target has a black piece in the first column (column 0). So if we perform a column (“line”) operation on column 0, then every row will have its cell in column 0 turned to black.\n\nThen look at the “extra” black pieces. Besides column 0, they are at:\n • Row 0, column 4\n • Row 2, column 2\n • Row 3, column 1\n\nObserve that for each of these cells the sum row+column is 4:\n • 0+4 = 4\n • 2+2 = 4\n • 3+1 = 4\n\nOne might think to use a diagonal_black operation on the anti‐diagonal corresponding to sum = 4. (Remember that “diagonal_black” applies to the diagonal running from bottom‐left to top‐right – the anti‐diagonals – which are defined by constant i+j.)\n\nHowever, applying diagonal_black on sum 4 will also affect cell (1,3) because 1+3 = 4 and cell (4,0) (which is already black because of column 0, so that is fine). The target for (1,3) is white though.\n\nTo fix this unintended black in cell (1,3) we can use the other operation: diagonal_white. (This operation turns all cells black on the top‐left to bottom‐right diagonal – those with constant difference i–j – to white.) Notice that cell (1,3) has a difference of 1–3 = –2. In fact, if we apply diagonal_white on diagonal –2, it will affect cell (1,3) as well as other cells which are already white (for example, (0,2), (2,4), and (3,5); check that 0–2 = –2, 2–4 = –2, 3–5 = –2). Thus the only “damage” is that (1,3) is corrected back to white.\n\nIn summary, the sequence is:\n1. Use a column operation (“line”) on column 0 to create the left‐edge of blacks.\n2. Use a diagonal_black operation on diagonal with sum = 4; this turns (0,4), (2,2), (3,1) black but unfortunately also sets (1,3) to black.\n3.

One possible solution is as follows.\n\nStep 1. Notice that if we “paint” along diagonals (bottom‐left → top‐right) we can cover the two desired black cells but will “overpaint” a few extra pieces. For example, if we choose the diagonal with constant (row+column)=2 then cell (0,2) (our target in row0) is made black but so are (1,1) and (2,0). Also, if we choose the diagonal with (row+column)=3 then cell (3,0) is painted black (our target in row3) but the extra cells (0,3), (1,2) and (2,1) are also turned black.\n\nAfter these two moves (operations 1 and 2) the board becomes\n\n Row0: cells (0,2) and (0,3) are black  \n Row1: cells (1,1) and (1,2) are black  \n Row2: cells (2,0) and (2,1) are black  \n Row3: cell (3,0) is black  \n Rows4 and 5: all remain white\n\nStep 2. Now, we want rows 1 and 2 completely white. So we use the row‐white operation on those rows. (Recall: the “row” operation turns a whole row to white.) Do this for row1 and row2 (operations 3 and 4). Now the board is\n\n Row0: (0,2) and (0,3) remain black  \n Row1: all white  \n Row2: all white  \n Row3: (3,0) black  \n Rows4 and 5: all white\n\nStep 3. At this point the only extra black cell is (0,3) in row0 (we want only (0,2) in that row). We need to “undo” (0,3) without disturbing (0,2). We can use the “diagonal_white” operation (which paints along a diagonal from top‐left to bottom‐right) on the diagonal that passes through (0,3). In such diagonals the index is given by (row – column). For (0,3), 0–3 = –3. Note that the top–left to bottom–right diagonal of constant –3 contains only (0,3), (1,4) and (2,5). Since (1,4) and (2,5) are already white it is safe to white‐out the diagonal. (That is our operation 5.)\n\nAfter this, the board is as required:\n\n Row0: White, White, Black, White, White, White  \n Row1: White all along  \n Row2: White all along  \n Row3: Black in col 0 and White elsewhere  \n Rows4 and 5: White\n\nWe used 5 operations, which is within the allowed 7.\n\nThus one acceptable answer is: \n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 2], ['diagonal_black', 3], ['row', 1], ['row', 2], ['diagonal_white', -3]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Notice that in the target, columns 3 and 4 are black in every row. So if we paint column 3 and column 4 black (using the \"line\" operation on each), those cells are done.

One valid solution is as follows. (Note that many solutions exist; here’s one way to “paint” the board correctly.)\n\nLet’s index rows 0–5 and columns 0–5.

Use a diagonal operation “diagonal_black” along the diagonal from bottom‐left to top‐right having constant r+c = 5. This turns the cells (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) and (5,0) black. (These cells already match the target.)\n\nStep 2. Use “diagonal_black” on the diagonal with r+c = 2. This makes the cells (0,2), (1,1) and (2,0) black. Notice the target wants (1,1) and (2,0) black but (0,2) should be white. We will correct that later.\n\nStep 3. Use a column (“line”) operation on column 5. This makes every cell in column 5 black. In the target column 5 every row is supposed to be black except row3. (At this point, row3 col5 becomes mistakenly black.)\n\nStep 4. To “fix” the two unwanted black cells – one from step 2 at (0,2) and the one from step 3 at (3,5) – use a diagonal operation “diagonal_white” along the diagonal running from top‐left to bottom‐right with constant (row – column) = –2. (Because (0,2) has 0–2 = –2 and (3,5) has 3–5 = –2. The diagonal covers (0,2), (1,3), (2,4) and (3,5). In the target all these cells are white.)

After this step the board is\n\n Row0: W W W W B W  \n Row1: W W W W B W  \n Row2: W W W W B W  \n Row3: W W W W B W  \n Row4: W W W W B W  \n Row5: W W W W B W  \n\nStep 2. Next, perform a diagonal_black operation on the diagonal identified by 4. (For the “diagonal_black” operation the parameter is taken to be the constant i+j value, so using 4 means every cell (i, j) with i+j = 4 becomes black.) On a 6×6 board the cells with i+j = 4 are  \n (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0).  \nAfter step 2 the black cells become as follows:\n • (0,4) was already black and remains so.\n • (1,3) becomes black (good for row1).\n • (2,2) becomes black (but the target row2 col2 must be white).\n • (3,1) becomes black (good for row3).\n • (4,0) becomes black (good for row4).  \nNow the board looks like\n\n Row0: W W W W B W  (target row0 is WWWWBW)  \n Row1: W W W B B W  (target row1 is WWWBBW)  \n Row2: W W B W B W  (target row2 is WWWWBW → error at col2)  \n Row3: W B W W B W  (target row3 is WBWWBW)  \n Row4: B W W W B W  (target row4 is BWWWWW → error at col4)  \n Row5: W W W W B W  (target row5 is WWWWBW)\n\nTwo cells are wrong: row2 col2 is black (should be white) and row4 col4 is still black (should be white).\n\nStep 3. We fix these with a diagonal_white operation that uses the main diagonal (top‐left to bottom‐right). (Here the parameter is taken to be the value of i–j. Choosing 0 fixes the main diagonal with i–j = 0.) The main diagonal cells are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5). Operating “diagonal_white” with parameter 0 turns these white. Thus row2 col2 becomes white and row4 col4 is corrected to white while none of the other black pieces (which are not on this diagonal) are affected.\n\nThe final board is\n\n Row0: W W W W B W  (WWWWBW)  \n Row1: W W W B B W  (WWWBBW)  \n Row2: W W W W B W  (WWWWBW)  \n Row3: W B W W B W  (WBWWBW)  \n Row4: B W W W W W  (BWWWWW)  \n Row5: W W W W B W  (WWWWBW)\n\nThis exactly matches the target.\n\nThus one valid solution in the required format is:\n[['line', 4], ['diagonal_black', 4], ['diagonal_white', 0]]\n\nAnswer: [['line', 4], ['diagonal_black', 4], ['diagonal_white', 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One solution is to “paint” the tricky column (column 3) entirely black—and then “fix” the two bottom rows that should have a white piece in that column—before finally “restoring” the other columns that are uniformly black. Notice that in the target the cells in\n\n • column 0 are black in every row,\n • column 2 are black in every row, and\n • column 3 is black for rows 0–3 but white for rows 4–5.\n\nBecause our “line” operation turns an entire column to black, we use it for the uniform columns (col 0 and col 2). For column 3 we first “paint” it black (knowing this will “over‐paint” rows 4–5 where it must be white) and then fix rows 4 and 5 by “row” operations (which set an entire row to white). Finally, re‐applying the column operations for col 0 and col 2 (which come later) ensures that even after resetting rows 4–5 to white the desired cells are black again.

One valid solution is as follows. (Note that many valid answers exist and the following is only one possibility.)\n\nLet’s explain our idea briefly. We start from an all‑white board. Notice that almost every row should have column 3 and column 5 black except row 3 (which must stay mostly white, with only column 4 black). So one way is to “force” columns 3 and 5 into black everywhere and then later “fix” row 3. Also the pattern shows that in rows 1 and 2 the missing “extra” blacks (at col2 and col1, respectively) can be supplied by coloring the diagonal with “r+c = 3” (this diagonal includes (1,2) and (2,1)). In addition, we must “add” row 5’s missing black at col2 and at the same time repair row 3 by restoring its proper lone black at col4. We achieve both by blackening the diagonal with sum = 7 (which hits (3,4) and (5,2)).\n\nA concrete five‐step sequence is:\n\n1. Use a column (“line”) operation on column 3. This makes every cell in col3 black.\n2. Use a column (“line”) operation on column 5. Now every cell in col5 is black.\n   • At this point every row has col3 and col5 black. In particular, rows 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5 match the target in these columns. (But note: row 3 must not have col3 black and col5 black.)\n3. Use a diagonal operation “diagonal_black” with parameter 3. (This op paints every cell for which row+column = 3 black.) In our 0‐based board, that diagonal is {(0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0)}. Its effect is to add a black piece at (1,2) and (2,1) – exactly what is needed in rows 1 and 2. (It does also color (3,0), an unwanted cell in row 3.)\n4. “Fix” row 3 by “resetting” it to white using the row operation. That is, apply a “row” operation on row 3. (This resets the entire row 3 to white; it clears the mistakes in row 3 including the wrongly colored cells at (3,0), (3,3) and (3,5).)\n5. Finally, we need to supply the one black cell that row 3 should have (cell (3,4)) and also add one missing black for row 5 (cell (5,2)). We achieve both by applying a diagonal operation “diagonal_black” with parameter 7. (The diagonal with r+c = 7 is {(2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2)}. Notice that (2,5) and (4,3) were already black while this op makes (3,4) black – exactly row 3’s required black – and (5,2) becomes black to complete row5’s pattern.)\n\nAfter these five operations the board becomes exactly:\n\nRow0: W W W B W B  \nRow1: W W B B W B  \nRow2: W B W B W B  \nRow3: W W W W B W  \nRow4: W W W B W B  \nRow5: W W B B W B  \n\nwhich is precisely the target board.\n\nThus one valid answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['line', 3], ['line', 5], ['diagonal_black', 3], ['row', 3], ['diagonal_black', 7]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Also, almost every row (except row 5) requires column 2 to be black; so we use the “line” move on column 2 – even though that temporarily sets row 5–column 2 black (it should be white in the target). We will later “correct” that cell by selectively “whitening” its diagonal using the diagonal_white move. Finally, the remaining black cells (in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5) all lie on two diagonals (when you compute the sum r+c): one diagonal with constant sum 3 (covering row0 col3 and row2 col1) and a second diagonal with constant sum 6 (covering row1 col5, row3 col3, and row5 col1).\n\nHere is one valid sequence:\n\n1.

One valid sequence is as follows.\n\nStart with an all‐white 6×6 board. We want the target (indexing rows 0–5 and columns 0–5) with\n\n Row0: W W B B W W  \n Row1: W B W B W W  \n Row2: W W W B W W  \n Row3: W W W B W W  \n Row4: W W W W W W  \n Row5: W W W W W B\n\nOne idea is to “paint” a whole column black (using the column operation “line”) that makes most of the needed blacks appear (namely in column 3), then fix the extra errors in rows that must remain white (using a row op and\/or a diagonal white op), and finally “add” the missing blacks using a diagonal black op. For example, consider this sequence:\n\n1. Use a column (line) op on column 3.\n • Operation: [\"line\", 3]  \n • Effect: All cells in col 3 become black.  \n  Now rows 0–5 have a black in col 3.  \n  (This gives row0–3 their needed black at col3 but also makes row4 and row5 have an extra black at col3.)\n\n2. Use an anti‐diagonal black op to add (5,5).\n • For an anti‐diagonal (“diagonal_black”), the index is the sum (r+c). For cell (5,5) the sum is 10.  \n • Operation: [\"diagonal_black\", 10]  \n • Effect: All cells with r+c = 10 become black. In a 6×6 board the only valid cell is (5,5).\n\n3. Use a row op to fix row 4.\n • Operation: [\"row\", 4]  \n • Effect: Row 4 becomes entirely white (thus clearing its unwanted black at col3).\n\n4. Use an anti‐diagonal black op to add two more black cells.\n • Notice that (0,2) and (1,1) (which we need black) both lie on the anti‐diagonal where r+c = 2. (Indeed, 0+2 = 2 and 1+1 = 2.)  \n • Operation: [\"diagonal_black\", 2]  \n • Effect: All cells with r+c = 2 become black. This turns (0,2) and (1,1) black but also inadvertently turns (2,0) black (since 2+0 = 2). (At this point many rows are as in the target except that row2 now has an extra black at col0 and row5 still has its extra black at col3.)\n\n5. Finally, fix those “extra” blacks by using a diagonal white op.\n • The “diagonal_white” op works along a main diagonal (from top‐left to bottom‐right) where the constant is r–c. We want to white the cell (2,0) (since 2–0 = 2) and also clear (5,3) (because 5–3 = 2) while not affecting our needed blacks (note that (0,2) has 0–2 = –2 and (1,1) has 0, so they stay black).  \n • Operation: [\"diagonal_white\", 2]  \n • Effect: All cells with r–c = 2 become white. For our board, these are (2,0), (3,1), (4,2), and (5,3).  \n • This fixes row2 (removing the unintended black at (2,0)) and clears row5 col3 (so row5 keeps only the desired black at col5).\n\nLet’s check the final board after these 5 operations:\n\n• Row0 initially had col3 black from op1 and then gets col2 black from op4. (r–c for (0,2) is –2 so op5 does not affect it.) Final row0: W, W, B, B, W, W  \n• Row1 gets col3 black from op1 and col1 black from op4. (r–c for (1,1) is 0, so unaffected by op5.) Final row1: W, B, W, B, W, W  \n• Row2 had col3 black from op1; op4 temporarily turned (2,0) black but op5 cleared (2,0). Final row2: W, W, W, B, W, W  \n• Row3 has col3 black from op1; op5 clears (3,1) (which is not needed). Final row3: W, W, W, B, W, W  \n• Row4 was cleared by op3. Final row4: W, W, W, W, W, W  \n• Row5 got col3 black from op1 (but turned white by op5) and got (5,5) black from op2. Final row5: W, W, W, W, W, B  \n\nThis exactly matches the target board.\n\nThus one valid answer is:\n\nAnswer: [['line', 3], ['diagonal_black', 10], ['row', 4], ['diagonal_black', 2], ['diagonal_white', 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Any valid 5–operation solution is acceptable.) Starting from an all–white 6×6 board, we note that the target board is\n\n Row0: W B W W W W  \n Row1: W B W W W W  \n Row2: W B W B W W  \n Row3: W B B W W B  \n Row4: W B W W B W  \n Row5: B B W B W W  \n\nOne idea is to use a column (“line”) operation to fix the column that is black everywhere (column1) and then “paint in” the other black cells with anti–diagonals (“diagonal_black”). Because the anti–diagonals will “over‐paint” a few cells that should remain white, we use the white–diagonal (“diagonal_white”) operations to “clean up.”\n\nStep 1. Use a column operation on column 1 (“line”, 1).  \n • This turns every cell in col1 black. (Note that target col1 is all black.)  \n\nStep 2. Use a diagonal_black operation with index 5.  \n • Interpreting “diagonal_black” as operating along the diagonal running from bottom–left to top–right (that is, along all cells with r+c = constant) the diagonal with sum = 5 covers cells:  \n  (5,0), (4,1), (3,2), (2,3), (1,4) and (0,5).  \n • This paints (5,0), (3,2) and (2,3) as needed. It does “over–paint” (1,4) and (0,5). (Other cells such as (4,1) already were black.)  \n\nStep 3. Use another diagonal_black operation with index 8.  \n • The anti–diagonal with r+c = 8 contains: (5,3), (4,4) and (3,5).  \n • Exactly those cells that were still white but should be black in rows 3, 4 and 5 are now painted black.  \n\nAt this point the board is almost correct. Compare:\n • Row0 now has black in col1 and –erroneously– in col5.  \n • Row1 now has black in col1 and –erroneously– in col4.\n • The other rows match the target.\n\nStep 4. Use a diagonal_white operation to “clean” the unwanted cell in row1 (and any others along that diagonal that must be white).  \n • The “diagonal_white” is taken along the top–left to bottom–right directions (the cells on the same TL–BR diagonal share r–c = constant). Notice that cell (1,4) has 1–4 = –3. In fact the TL–BR diagonal for –3 is: (0,3), (1,4) and (2,5).  \n • Applying diagonal_white with index –3 turns all these cells white. (Neither (0,3) nor (2,5) were supposed to be black so no harm is done; (1,4) is corrected.)  \n\nStep 5. Use one more diagonal_white operation for the remaining mistake.  \n • Notice that (0,5) has 0–5 = –5. Its TL–BR “diagonal” (with index –5) contains only (0,5).  \n • So applying diagonal_white with index –5 corrects that cell.\n\nAfter these 5 operations the board becomes exactly\n\n Row0: W B W W W W  \n Row1: W B W W W W  \n Row2: W B W B W W  \n Row3: W B B W W B  \n Row4: W B W W B W  \n Row5: B B W B W W  \n\nwhich is our target.\n\nThus one valid solution is:\n\n[['line', 1], ['diagonal_black', 5], ['diagonal_black', 8], ['diagonal_white', -3], ['diagonal_white', -5]]\n\nAnswer: [['line', 1], ['diagonal_black', 5], ['diagonal_black', 8], ['diagonal_white', -3], ['diagonal_white', -5]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

(Below is one valid solution; there may be others.)\n\nOur idea is to “paint” large parts of the target black with operations that “force” entire columns or diagonals to the needed color, and then “fix” any extra black cells by “erasing” (turning white) a carefully chosen diagonal. In our solution the target board (with rows numbered 0–5 and columns 0–5) is\n\n Row0: B B W W B W  \n Row1: W B W W B W  \n Row2: W B W W B B  \n Row3: W B W W B W  \n Row4: W B W B B W  \n Row5: W B W W B B\n\nStarting from an all‐white board, note that column 1 must be entirely black and column 4 must be entirely black. Also the “isolated” black cells at (0,0) and (5,5) can be “sized” by picking a diagonal (bottom‐left to top‐right) that has only one element; indeed, for a 6×6 board the “diagonal_black” of index 0 (r+c = 0) affects only cell (0,0) and that of index 10 (r+c = 10) affects only cell (5,5).\n\nOne challenge was that the two “middle extra” black positions we still need – at (2,5) and (4,3) – lie on the same bottom‐left–to–top‐right diagonal (they share r+c = 7). If we “paint” that whole diagonal black with a single operation (which also turns (3,4) black   [but (3,4) is meant to be black]   and (5,2) – an unwanted extra – black) we then must “fix” the extra cell (5,2). We do so by using a diagonal “white” op. (The “diagonal_white” operation works along the diagonal from top‐left to bottom‐right; that is, it turns every cell with the same r–c to white.) Notice that although (5,2) lies on the diagonal with r–c = 3, that same diagonal also meets cell (4,1); and fortunately target row4 must have a black piece at col1. So we plan our moves in an order that “re‐adds” the lost black in col1 afterward.\n\nHere is one valid 6–move solution. The moves (in order) are:\n\n1. Apply a diagonal_black op with index 0. This “paints” cell (0,0) black.\n2. Apply a diagonal_black op with index 7. This makes every cell with r+c = 7 black – that is, it turns (2,5), (3,4), (4,3) black, but it also paints (5,2) black (an error).\n3. Apply a diagonal_black op with index 10. (Only cell (5,5) is affected, as it is alone on that diagonal.)\n4. Now “erase” the undesired black at (5,2) (and possibly other unwanted cells on that diagonal) by applying a diagonal_white op with index 3. (Recall: the “diagonal_white” op acts on all cells with a constant value of r–c. With index 3 the cells (3,0), (4,1), and (5,2) are turned white. In the target (3,0) is white; although (4,1) should be black, we will restore col1 in a later move.)\n5. Apply a “line” op (column operation) on column 1. This forces every cell in col1 to black (so row4, col1 becomes black as desired).\n6. Apply a “line” op on column 4. This forces every cell in col4 to black.\n\nLet’s quickly “read‐off” the final board:\n• Row0 becomes: [B (from move1), B (move5), W, W, B (move6), W] → BBWWBW  \n• Row1 becomes: [W, B, W, W, B, W] → WBWWBW  \n• Row2 becomes: [W, B, W, W, B, B (from move2)] → WBWWBB  \n• Row3 becomes: [W, B, W, W, B, W] → WBWWBW  \n• Row4 becomes: [W, B (restored in move5), W, B (from move2), B (move6), W] → WBWBBW  \n• Row5 becomes: [W, B (move5), W (fixed in move4), W, B (move6), B (move3)] → WBWWBB  \n\nAll rows now match the target.

So we begin by “painting” these two columns using the “line” (column) operation.\n\nStep 1. Operation: [\"line\", 4]  \n• After this, every cell in column 4 becomes black.\n\nStep 2. Operation: [\"line\", 5]  \n• Now every cell in column 5 is black.\n\nAfter these two operations, every row looks like this (columns 4 and 5 are black, the others remain white):\n Row0: W W W W B B  \n Row1: W W W W B B  \n Row2: W W W W B B  \n Row3: W W W W B B  \n Row4: W W W W B B  \n Row5: W W W W B B\n\nNow compare with the target for each row:\n• Row0 needs col3 black.\n• Row1 needs col2 black and col3 black.\n• Row2 needs col1 and col2 black.\n• Row3 needs col0 and col1 black.\n• Row4 needs col0 and col3 black.\n• Row5 needs col2 black.\n\nIt turns out that many of those missing blacks lie on “diagonals” (bottom‐left to top‐right, which are defined by constant sum i+j). For example, notice these missing black cells:\n (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0) all have i+j = 3.\n\nStep 3. Operation: [\"diagonal_black\", 3]  \n• This sets all cells on the diagonal i+j = 3 to black, namely: (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,0).\n\nNow the board becomes:\n Row0: W W W B B B (correct)  \n Row1: W W B W B B (missing (1,3))  \n Row2: W B W W B B (missing (2,2))  \n Row3: B W W W B B (missing (3,1))  \n Row4: W W W W B B (missing (4,0) and (4,3))  \n Row5: W W W W B B (missing (5,2))\n\nWe still need to blacken:\n (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0). Notice these four cells all lie on the diagonal where i+j = 4.\n\nStep 4. Operation: [\"diagonal_black\", 4]  \n• The diagonal i+j = 4 includes: (0,4) [already black], (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), and (4,0). This operation blacks the missing ones in rows 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\nAfter this, the board updates to:\n Row1: W W B B B B (correct)  \n Row2: W B B W B B (correct)  \n Row3: B B W W B B (correct)  \n Row4: B W W W B B (still missing (4,3))  \n Row5: W W W W B B (still missing (5,2))\n\nNow missing are (4,3) and (5,2). They both lie on the diagonal with i+j = 7:\n (4,3): 4+3 = 7  \n (5,2): 5+2 = 7  \n(the diagonal i+j = 7 also contains some already‐black cells such as (2,5) and (3,4), but that does not hurt).\n\nStep 5. Operation: [\"diagonal_black\", 7]  \n• This blacks every cell on the diagonal i+j = 7, which turns (4,3) and (5,2) black.\n\nAt this point the board is:\n Row0: W W W B B B  \n Row1: W W B B B B  \n Row2: W B B W B B  \n Row3: B B W W B B  \n Row4: B W W B B B  \n Row5: W W B B B B  \nwhich exactly matches the target board.\n\nWe achieved the transformation in 5 operations (within the allowed 6).\n\nAnswer: [['line', 4], ['line', 5], ['diagonal_black', 3], ['diagonal_black', 4], ['diagonal_black', 7]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One way to do so is to notice that several groups of black cells lie exactly on anti‐diagonals (i.e. the “diagonal_black” moves that run from the bottom‐left to the top‐right of the board). In our convention we label the anti‐diagonals by the sum (row + column) of their cell coordinates (with the top row as row 0 and the leftmost column as column 0). For example, the anti‐diagonal with sum = 5 covers (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) and (5,0). Looking at the target pattern\n\n Row0: B B W B W B  \n Row1: B W B W B W  \n Row2: B B W B W W  \n Row3: B W B W W B  \n Row4: B B W W B W  \n Row5: B W W B W B  \n\nwe notice that many of the black cells lie exactly on the following anti‐diagonals:\n • For sum = 1, the cells are (0,1) and (1,0) – both should be black.\n • For sum = 3, the cells are (0,3), (1,2), (2,1) and (3,0) – all desired black.\n • For sum = 5, the cells are (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) and (5,0) – exactly as needed.\n • For sum = 8, we cover (3,5), (4,4) and (5,3) – again all target black.\n • For sum = 10, we have just (5,5) – which must be black.\n\nAfter these five diagonal_black moves the board has black pieces in all positions marked by these anti‐diagonals. What remains are the leftmost cells in rows 0, 2 and 4 (at positions (0,0), (2,0) and (4,0)) that are black in the target but were not included in any anti‐diagonal so far. (In fact, column 0 in the target is entirely black.) We then finish by a “line” (i.e. column) operation on column 0 to paint it entirely black.\n\nThus, with a total of 6 operations we have:\n 1. diagonal_black with parameter 1 → paints (0,1) and (1,0)\n 2. diagonal_black with parameter 3 → paints (0,3), (1,2), (2,1) and (3,0)\n 3. diagonal_black with parameter 5 → paints (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) and (5,0)\n 4. diagonal_black with parameter 8 → paints (3,5), (4,4) and (5,3)\n 5. diagonal_black with parameter 10 → paints (5,5)\n 6. line on column 0 → paints the entirety of column 0 black (thus ensuring that (0,0), (2,0) and (4,0) become black)\n\nWhen we take the union of all these black “strokes” (and noting that the board started all‐white and none of our operations ever “undo” black except by white moves, which we do not need here), we obtain exactly the target board.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 1], ['diagonal_black', 3], ['diagonal_black', 5], ['diagonal_black', 8], ['diagonal_black', 10], ['line', 0]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

One solution is as follows.\n\nStep 1. Use a column (“line”) operation on column 1 to blacken every cell in that column. This correctly sets (0,1), (1,1), (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1) to black (although (5,1) becomes black by accident, it will be fixed later).\n\nStep 2. Notice that the target needs (0,2), (1,1) and (2,0) to be black. The diagonal running from bottom‐left to top‐right (the “diagonal_black”) for which r+c = 2 covers cells (0,2), (1,1) and (2,0). So perform a diagonal_black operation with parameter 2. (Even though (1,1) was already black, that is fine.)\n\nStep 3. Next, the pattern requires (3,5) and (4,4) to be black. They lie on the diagonal with r+c = 8 (since 3+5 = 8 and 4+4 = 8). (This diagonal also hits (5,3) which we do not want, but we will fix row 5.) So perform a diagonal_black operation with parameter 8.\n\nStep 4. Finally, row 5 now has extra blacks at (5,1) and (5,3). But the target requires row 5 to be entirely white.

One valid solution is as follows. (Here we interpret the diagonal‐operations using a number parameter where for\n\n• “diagonal_black”: the parameter is the sum r+c of every cell on that “anti‐diagonal” (the bottom‑left‐to‑top‑right diagonal), and \n• “diagonal_white”: the parameter is the difference r–c of every cell on that “main diagonal” (the top‑left‐to‑bottom‑right diagonal).\n\nNote that we start with an all‑white 6×6 board and our target board has black pieces only at positions (row, column):\n\n  (0,1), (1,2), (2,2), and (4,2).\n\nThe idea is to use a “line” (i.e. column) operation on column 2 to set that column black (which correctly produces the needed blacks for rows 1,2,4 but also “overpaints” rows 0,3,5) and then “erase” the extra black cells by using the diagonal_white operations. However, before doing the line on col2 we want to “add” the lone black at (0,1) on row 0. (Using a “line” on column 1 would blacken that column entirely even though we want that only for row 0.) Fortunately, the “diagonal_black” operation lets us add a black piece “with a twist”: if we paint the anti‑diagonal with r+c = 1 it covers (0,1) (because 0+1 = 1) but it also covers (1,0) – an extra black that we must later “erase.”\n\nA possible 5‐operation solution is:\n\n1. Use diagonal_black with parameter 1. This turns (0,1) black (as desired) but also (1,0) becomes black (an extra error since row 1 should be WWBWWW).\n2. Use the “line” operation on column 2. This paints every cell in col 2 black. Now row1 gets its desired black at (1,2) but note that this op paints col 2 in every row – so rows 0,3,5 also have a black in col 2 (errors) while row1 already has an unwanted (1,0) from op 1.\n3. Use diagonal_white with parameter –2 (i.e. r–c = –2) to clear the extra black at (0,2). (For example, (0,2) has 0–2 = –2; other cells on that diagonal, such as (1,3), (2,4), (3,5) will also be restored to white.)\n4. Use diagonal_white with parameter 1 (i.e. r–c = 1) to clear both (1,0) and (3,2) (note that (3,2) on row 3 should be white). (The diagonal with r–c = 1 contains (1,0), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (5,4).)\n5. Use diagonal_white with parameter 3 (i.e. r–c = 3) to clear (5,2). (The diagonal with r–c = 3 contains (3,0), (4,1), (5,2).)\n\nAfter these 5 operations the board is as follows:\n\n• Row 0 becomes: white from col0, black at col1 (from op 1) and white for all the other cells (its extra col2 was erased by op 3) → WBWWWW.\n\n• Row 1 becomes: white except that col2 is black (from op 2) and its extra (1,0) was erased by op 4) → WWBWWW.\n\n• Row 2: col2 is black (from op 2) → WWBWWW.\n\n• Row 3: its unwanted black in col2 is erased by op 4) → WWWWWW.\n\n• Row 4: col2 remains black (from op 2) → WWBWWW.\n\n• Row 5: its black in col2 is erased by op 5) → WWWWWW.\n\nThis exactly matches the target.\n\nBelow is the answer in the required format.\n\nAnswer: [['diagonal_black', 1], ['line', 2], ['diagonal_white', -2], ['diagonal_white', 1], ['diagonal_white', 3]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Use the column (“line”) operation on column 1. This paints the entire column 1 black. (Now col1 is black in every row—even if that creates extra blacks in row2 and row5.)\n2. Then “fix” row 2 by making it all white using the row operation (this resets row 2 completely; we lose any undesired black on col1—but row2 is supposed to be white except where later repainted).\n3. Next, perform diagonal_black with parameter 5. This paints (0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0) black. (After this step, all cells match the target except for one cell: row5 col1 is still black from step 1, where it should be white.)\n4. Finally, we “fix” row 5’s column 1 by applying a diagonal_white (from top‐left to bottom‐right) on the diagonal that runs through (5,1). In a top‐left to bottom‐right diagonal all cells have constant (row – column). For cell (5,1) the value is 5 – 1 = 4. That diagonal (r – c = 4) in a 6×6 board has only (4,0) and (5,1).

Notice that in the target every cell in column 5 (i.e. the last column) is black. So we first use a column operation to “line‐black” column 5. That fixes col5 in every row.\n\nNext, observe that aside from col5 the following cells need to be black:\n• In row 2: col4.\n• In row 3: col3.\n• In row 4: col2.\n• In row 5: col1.\n\nThese four cells (plus the already–black cell at (1,5)) lie on the diagonal (bottom–left to top–right) whose elements satisfy row+column = 6. Hence, we use a diagonal_black operation on the diagonal labelled “6” (i.e. all cells with r+c = 6). This will turn (2,4), (3,3), (4,2) and (5,1) black.\n\nFinally, there are still two more black cells needed:\n• In row 4: col4.\n• In row 5: col3.\nThey both lie on the diagonal (bottom–left to top–right) with r+c = 8 (also (3,5) would be turned but it is already black from our earlier column op). So a third operation, a diagonal_black on the diagonal “8”, turns (4,4) and (5,3) black.\n\nThe sequence of three operations therefore is:\n1. Use a column operation (“line”) on col 5.\n2. Use a diagonal_black operation on diagonal with sum = 6.\n3. Use a diagonal_black operation on diagonal with sum = 8.\n\nWhen we simulate these on an all–white board we obtain exactly the target:\nRow0: WWWWWB\nRow1: WWWWWB\nRow2: WWWWBB\nRow3: WWWBWB\nRow4: WWBWBB\nRow5: WBWBWB\n\nAnswer: [['line', 5], ['diagonal_black', 6], ['diagonal_black', 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
