(0,0) = 1, (0,1) = 4 (valid in block 0,0).\n- **Row 3**: Column 3 missing 4, so (3,3) = 4. Column 5 missing 6, so (3,5) = 6. Column 1 missing 7, so (3,1) = 7.

Remaining missing in row 4: (4,8) = 6.\n- **Row 5**: Block 1,2 (columns 6-8, rows 3-5) missing 1, so (5,8) = 1. Column 5 missing 5, so (5,5) = 5. Column 1 missing 2, so (5,1) = 2. Remaining missing in row 5: (5,0) = 4.\n- **Row 6**: Column 0 missing 7, so (6,0) = 7. Column 7 missing 5, so (6,7) = 5.\n- **Row 7**: Column 4 missing 1, so (7,4) = 1.

The remaining cells are filled by analyzing column 3 and 3x3 blocks, leading to (3,3) = 1, (3,6) = 2, and (3,7) = 5, completing the row.\n5. **Row 4**: Missing numbers are 2, 4, 6, 7, 8. By analyzing the 3x3 block (rows 3-5, cols 0-2) and column 1, we place (4,1) = 7. The remaining cells are filled by checking column 3 and 3x3 blocks, leading to (4,3) = 2, (4,5) = 6, (4,6) = 8, and (4,7) = 4, completing the row.\n6. **Row 5**: Missing numbers are 3, 5, 6.

Since 7 is already in column 0 (row 6,0), (1,0) must be 2.\n- Block (0,0) (rows 0-2, cols 0-2) now has 2 (row 1,0). Row 1 becomes [2, 1, 8, 6, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0].\n- Column 4 (for cell (1,4)): Missing 1, 5, 6. Row 1's missing numbers include 5, so (1,4) = 5. Row 1 now has [2, 1, 8, 6, 5, 9, 4, 3, 0].\n- The last missing number in row 1 is 7, so (1,8) = 7.

Missing numbers: 1, 5, 6, 8.\n- Block (0,1) (rows 0-2, cols 3-5): Missing 1, 8. Thus, (0,4) = 1 and (0,5) = 8. Row 0 becomes [4, 3, 7, 2, 1, 8, 0, 0, 9].\n- Block (0,2) (rows 0-2, cols 6-8): Missing 5, 6. Column 6 (for (0,6)) is missing 6, so (0,6) = 6 and (0,7) = 5.

The last missing number in row 3 is 2, so (3,8) = 2. Row 3 is filled: [1, 8, 6, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 2].\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Row 4 and Block (1,0)\n- Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6]. Missing numbers: 2, 4, 9.\n- Block (1,0) (rows 3-5, cols 0-2): Missing 4, 9. Column 1 (for (4,1)) is missing 9, so (4,1) = 9 and (4,2) = 4. Row 4 becomes [5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6].\n- Column 5 (for (4,5)): Missing 2. (4,5) = 2.

Thus, (4,1) = 2.\n8. **Row 4, Columns 5-6**: Block 5 (rows 4-6, columns 4-6) is missing 5, 8. Row 4 is missing these values, so (4,5) = 5, (4,6) = 8.\n9. **Row 3, Columns 1-3**: Block 1 (rows 1-3, columns 1-3) is missing 1, 5. Row 3 is missing these values, so (3,1) = 1, (3,3) = 5.\n10. **Row 3, Column 7**: Block 3 (rows 1-3, columns 7-9) is missing 4, and row 3 is missing 4. Thus, (3,7) = 4.\n11. **Row 2, Columns 1-3**: Block 1 (rows 1-3, columns 1-3) is missing 6, 2, 1.

This resolves row 5 as `[6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1]`.\n6. **Row 6**: Using the bottom-left and bottom-middle blocks, we determine the missing values are 7, 8, 1, 5, and 2. This resolves row 6 as `[7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2]`.\n7. **Row 7**: By checking the bottom-left and bottom-right blocks, we fill in the missing values as 9, 2, 7, 4, 3, and 6.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Row 0\nRow 0: [9, 4, 1, 6, 0, 8, 0, 5, 3]. Missing numbers: 2, 7.  \n- Column 4 (5th column) in Row 0 is part of the top-middle 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). This block has numbers 6, 8, 1, 7, 5, 3, missing 2, 4, 9. Since Row 0 already has 9, 4, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, the only possible value for Row 0, Column 4 is 2.  \n- This leaves Row 0, Column 6 (7th column) with 7.  \nRow 0 becomes: [9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3].\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Row 2\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 0].

Row 2, Column 0 must be 6 (since 2 is in Row 3, Column 0).  \n- Row 2, Column 1 (2nd column) is 2 (remaining from the block).  \n- The top-right 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8) has numbers 7, 5, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, missing 1, 6. Row 2, Column 8 (9th column) must be 1.  \nRow 2 becomes: [6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1].\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Row 1\nRow 1: [0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 8].

The missing numbers are 1, 2, 7, 9. Using column and block constraints, we find row 8 must be `[8, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3]`.\n\n3. **Row 7** is `[1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 5]`. The missing numbers are 3, 4, 6, 8, 9. By analyzing the 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) and column constraints, we determine row 7 must be `[1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7, 5]`.\n\n4. **Row 5** is `[0, 9, 0, 3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 0]`. The missing numbers are 2, 4, 6. Using block constraints (rows 3-5, columns 0-2), we find row 5 must be `[2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 4]`.\n\n5. **Row 4** is `[3, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6]`. The missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, 7, 9. By analyzing the 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) and column constraints, we determine row 4 must be `[3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6]`.\n\n6. **Row 3** is `[5, 1, 4, 0, 9, 0, 3, 8, 0]`. The missing numbers are 2, 6, 7. Using block constraints (rows 3-5, columns 3-5), we find row 3 must be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7]`.\n\n7. **Row 2** is `[0, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 0, 0, 0]`. The missing numbers are 3, 6, 7, 8. By analyzing column and block constraints, we determine row 2 must be `[7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8]`.\n\n8. **Row 1** and **Row 0** are filled by analyzing remaining column and block constraints, ensuring all numbers 1-9 are unique in each row, column, and block.\n\n### Final Solution:\nThe completed Sudoku grid is as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[4, 2, 8, 6, 3, 1, 7, 5, 9], [6, 3, 9, 7, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1], [7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8], [5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7], [3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6], [2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 4], [9, 6, 3, 8, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2], [1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7, 5], [8, 7, 5, 1, 4, 2, 9, 6, 3]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The last cell (column 8) is then 2.\n2. **Row 4**: The missing numbers are 2, 5, 6. The middle-left 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) lacks 2, so row 4, column 2 is 2. Column 4 (index 4) in the middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) lacks 5, so row 4, column 4 is 5. The remaining cell (column 7) is 6.\n3. **Row 5**: The middle-left 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) lacks 8, so row 5, column 0 is 8. The middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) lacks 2 and 3, so row 5, column 4 is 3 and column 5 is 2. The middle-right block (rows 3-5, columns 6-8) lacks 4 and 7, so row 5, column 6 is 4 and column 8 is 7.\n4. **Row 7**: Column 4 (index 4) in the bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, columns 3-5) lacks 7, so row 7, column 4 is 7. The bottom-right block (rows 6-8, columns 6-8) lacks 6 and 9, so row 7, column 6 is 6 and column 8 is 9. The remaining cell (column 1) is 2.\n5. **Row 6**: The bottom-left block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) lacks 7 and 8, so row 6, column 1 is 7 and column 2 is 8. The bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, columns 3-5) lacks 6 and 9, so row 6, column 3 is 6 and column 5 is 9.\n6. **Row 8**: The bottom-left block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) lacks 9, so row 8, column 2 is 9. The bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, columns 3-5) lacks 4, so row 8, column 5 is 4. The bottom-right block (rows 6-8, columns 6-8) lacks 5 and 7, so row 8, column 6 is 5 and column 7 is 7.\n7. **Row 2**: The top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) lacks 6, so row 2, column 2 is 6. The top-right block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8) lacks 2 and 4, so row 2, column 6 is 2 and column 7 is 4.\n8. **Row 1**: The top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) lacks 2, 4, 5, 9. Column 0 (index 0) lacks 2, so row 1, column 0 is 2. The top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5) lacks 7, so row 1, column 3 is 7.

Column 3 (row 8, column 3) must be 1 (since column 3 is missing 1), so row 8 becomes `[5, 4, 6, 1, 9, 3, 2, 8, 7]`.\n2. **Row 7**: The missing numbers are 1, 3, 5, 6. Column 0 (row 7, column 0) must be 1 (since column 0 is missing 1), so row 7 starts with `[1, 9, ...]`.\n3. **Row 6**: Column 5 (row 6, column 5) is in a 3x3 block missing 6, so row 6, column 5 = 6. Later, column 1 (row 6, column 1) is missing 8, so row 6, column 1 = 8.\n4. **Row 0**: Columns 4 and 5 (row 0, columns 4-5) are in a 3x3 block missing 3 and 2, so row 0, column 4 = 3 and row 0, column 5 = 2. The remaining missing numbers (7, 8) fill columns 6 and 7.\n5. **Row 2**: Column 0 (row 2, column 0) is missing 8 (from column 0), and column 2 (row 2, column 2) is missing 5 (from its 3x3 block). The remaining missing numbers (3) fill column 7.\n6. **Row 1**: Columns 1 and 2 (row 1, columns 1-2) are missing 3 and 2 (from their 3x3 block), so row 1, column 1 = 3 and row 1, column 2 = 2. The remaining missing numbers (4, 1) fill columns 6 and 8.\n7. **Row 3**: Column 2 (row 3, column 2) is missing 9 (from its 3x3 block). Columns 5 and 6 (row 3, columns 5-6) are missing 8 and 7, so row 3, column 5 = 8 and row 3, column 6 = 7.\n8. **Row 4**: Column 0 (row 4, column 0) is missing 7 (from column 0). Columns 3 and 4 (row 4, columns 3-4) are missing 6 and 1 (from their 3x3 block), so row 4, column 3 = 6 and row 4, column 4 = 1. The remaining missing number (8) fills column 8.\n9. **Row 5**: Column 5 (row 5, column 5) is missing 4 (from its 3x3 block). Columns 6 and 8 (row 5, columns 6-8) are missing 6 and 9 (from their 3x3 block), so row 5, column 6 = 6 and row 5, column 8 = 9.\n10. **Row 7**: Column 2 (row 7, column 2) is missing 3 (from its 3x3 block).

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Block (0,0) and Column 0\n- Block (0,0) (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) has missing numbers 3 and 8. Since row 1 cannot contain 8 (already present in row 1, column 3), row 1, column 0 (r1c0) is 3. Thus, row 2, column 0 (r2c0) is 8.\n- Column 0 now has [4, 3, 8, 9, 2, 5, 0, 0, 6]. Missing numbers 1 and 7 are placed in rows 6 and 7, column 0 (r6c0=7, r7c0=1).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Row 2, Column 5\n- Row 2 is missing 7. Thus, row 2, column 5 (r2c5) is 7.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Row 0\n- Row 0 is missing 3, 5, 6. Column 8 for row 0 (r0c8) must be 6 (since 3 and 5 are in columns 3 and 4). Thus, row 0 becomes [4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6].\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Row 5\n- Row 5 is missing 1 and 2. Column 3 for row 5 (r5c3) is 2 (since 1 is in column 1). Thus, row 5, column 1 (r5c1) is 1. Row 5 becomes [5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3].\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Row 4\n- Row 4 is missing 1, 7, 8, 9. Block (1,1) (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) requires 7 and 9. Thus, row 4, column 3 (r4c3)=9 and row 4, column 4 (r4c4)=7. Row 4 becomes [2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8].\n\n### Step 6: Analyze Row 1\n- Row 1 is missing 2, 6, 9. Column 4 for row 1 (r1c4)=2 and column 5 (r1c5)=6. Column 7 for row 1 (r1c7)=9. Row 1 becomes [3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7].\n\n### Step 7: Analyze Row 3\n- Row 3 is missing 2, 3, 6. Block (1,0) (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) requires 3. Thus, row 3, column 2 (r3c2)=3. Columns 6 and 7 for row 3 (r3c6=2, r3c7=6). Row 3 becomes [9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4].\n\n### Step 8: Analyze Row 7\n- Row 7 is missing 2, 3, 4, 7. Column 2 for row 7 (r7c2)=2. Column 7 for row 7 (r7c7)=3. Column 4 (r7c4)=4 and column 6 (r7c6)=7. Row 7 becomes [1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5].\n\n### Step 9: Analyze Row 6\n- Row 6 is missing 2, 3, 6, 8, 9. Column 1 (r6c1)=3. Column 8 (r6c8)=9. Row 6 becomes [7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9].\n\n### Step 10: Analyze Row 8\n- Row 8 is missing 7, 9. Column 2 (r8c2)=9. Column 3 (r8c3)=7. Row 8 becomes [6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2].\n\n### Final Solution\nThe completed Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6],[3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7],[8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1],[9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4],[2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8],[5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3],[7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9],[1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5],[6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) contains 9, 3, 6, 2, 7, so the missing numbers are 1, 4, 5, 8. Since row 3 already has 1, 5, 9, 3, 6, 7, the empty cell in column 5 (row 3) must be 8. Thus, row 3 becomes `[2, 1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 6, 4, 7]`.\n\n2. **Row 4**: Given `[9, 3, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 1, 0]`, the missing numbers are 2, 4, 5, 8. The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) contains 2, 1, 5, 9, 3, 6, so the missing numbers are 4, 7, 8. The empty cell in column 2 (row 4) must be 8. The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) now has 9, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2, so the missing numbers are 1, 4, 5. The empty cell in column 4 (row 4) must be 4. The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 6-8) has 6, 4, 7, 1, 3, 9, 8, so the missing numbers are 2, 5. The empty cells in columns 6 and 8 (row 4) must be 2 and 5. Thus, row 4 becomes `[9, 3, 8, 6, 4, 7, 2, 1, 5]`.\n\n3. **Row 5**: Given `[6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 9, 3, 8]`, the missing numbers are 1, 4, 5, 7. The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) has 2, 1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 6, so the missing numbers are 4, 7. The empty cells in columns 1 and 2 (row 5) must be 4 and 7. The 3x3 block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) has 9, 3, 8, 6, 4, 7, 2, so the missing numbers are 1, 5. The empty cells in columns 4 and 5 (row 5) must be 1 and 5. Thus, row 5 becomes `[6, 4, 7, 2, 1, 5, 9, 3, 8]`.\n\n4. **Row 6**: Given `[3, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 5, 9]`, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6. The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) has 3, 8, 5, 9, so the missing numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 7. The empty cell in column 2 (row 6) must be 2. The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 3-5) has 7, 1, 3, 8, so the missing numbers are 2, 4, 5, 6, 9. The empty cells in columns 3 and 5 (row 6) must be 4 and 6. The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 6-8) has 5, 9, 2, so the missing numbers are 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. The empty cell in column 6 (row 6) must be 1.

The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) has 3, 8, 2, 5, 9, so the missing numbers are 1, 4, 6, 7. The empty cell in column 0 (row 8) must be 1. The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 3-5) has 7, 1, 3, 8, 4, 6, so the missing numbers are 2, 5, 9. The empty cell in column 5 (row 8) must be 6. The 3x3 block (rows 6-8, columns 6-8) has 1, 5, 9, 2, so the missing numbers are 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. The empty cells in columns 6 and 7 (row 8) must be 4 and 7. Thus, row 8 becomes `[1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 6, 4, 7, 2]`.\n\n6. **Row 2**: Given `[7, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 8, 6, 0]`, the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5) has 9, so the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The empty cells in columns 3 and 5 (row 2) must be 1 and 5. The 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8) has 8, 6, so the missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. The empty cell in column 8 (row 2) must be 4. Thus, row 2 becomes `[7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 1, 8, 6, 4]`.\n\n7. **Row 0 and Row 1**: Using similar logic to fill the remaining cells, we deduce:\n   - Row 0: `[4, 6, 1, 7, 2, 5, 3, 9, 8]`\n   - Row 1: `[5, 9, 8, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 1]`\n   - Row 7: `[8, 7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 5, 8, 3]` → Corrected to `[8, 7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 8, 3]` (but adjusted to avoid duplicates): `[8, 7, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 8, 3]` is incorrect.

For example, in block (0,2) (top-right 3x3 block), the missing numbers are 4 and 9. By checking row 0 and column constraints, we determine row 0, columns 7 and 8 must be 4 and 9, respectively.\n\n### Step 2: Fill in Row 1\nRow 1 has missing numbers 4 and 9 in columns 1 and 2 (block (0,0)). Column 1 constraints confirm row 1, column 1 = 4 and row 1, column 2 = 9.\n\n### Step 3: Solve Row 2\nRow 2 has missing numbers 4, 5, 9 in columns 3-5 (block (0,1)). After checking column constraints, we determine row 2, columns 3-5 = 5, 4, 9.\n\n### Step 4: Solve Row 3\nRow 3 has missing numbers 2, 6, 7 in columns 6-8 (block (1,2)). Column and block constraints confirm row 3, columns 6-8 = 2, 7, 6.\n\n### Step 5: Solve Row 4\nRow 4 has missing numbers 4, 5, 8. By analyzing column 5 and block (1,1), we determine row 4, columns 4-5 = 8, 5, and row 4, column 6 = 4.\n\n### Step 6: Solve Row 5\nRow 5 has missing numbers 2, 6, 7 in columns 3-5 (block (1,1)). Column constraints confirm row 5, columns 3-5 = 2, 7, 6.\n\n### Step 7: Solve Rows 6-8\nRows 6-8 are solved by checking remaining missing numbers in their respective blocks, rows, and columns. For example, row 6, column 0 = 7 (block (2,0)), row 7, column 0 = 8 (block (2,0)), and row 8, columns 0-1 = 9, 1 (block (2,0)).\n\n### Final Solution\nThe completed Sudoku grid is as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 8, 5, 4, 9],[5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 8],[6, 3, 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7],[3, 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7, 6],[2, 7, 6, 3, 8, 5, 4, 9, 1],[4, 9, 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 8, 5],[7, 6, 3, 8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2],[8, 5, 4, 9, 1, 2, 7, 6, 3],[9, 1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 8, 5, 4]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Column 0 is missing 1,3,4. The common missing number is 4, so row 0, col 0 = 4.\n\n### Step 2: Complete Row 0\nRow 0 becomes [4, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]. Block (0,0) now needs 5,7,8. Column 2 (third column) is missing 1,2,7. Since 1 is in row 0, row 0, col 2 = 7. Row 0 now has [4, 1, 7, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]. Block (0,1) (rows 0-2, cols 3-5) needs 2,8,9. Row 0 needs 2,8.

Row 6, col 6 (seventh column) = 7. Row 6 is now [3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8].\n\n### Step 9: Complete Row 7\nRow 7: [6, 0, 0, 7, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0]. Block (2,0) (rows 6-8, cols 0-2) needs 1,4, so row 7, col 1 = 4 and row 7, col 2 = 1. Block (2,2) (rows 6-8, cols 6-8) needs 3,5, so row 7, col 6 = 3 and row 7, col 8 = 5. Row 7 is now [6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5].\n\n### Step 10: Complete Row 8\nRow 8: [7, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Block (2,1) (rows 6-8, cols 3-5) needs 5,9, so row 8, col 4 = 9 and row 8, col 5 = 5. Block (2,2) needs 1,6, so row 8, col 6 = 6 and row 8, col 8 = 1. Row 8 is now [7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1].\n\n### Final Solution\nThe completed Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6],[2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7],[9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3],[1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4],[8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2],[5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9],[3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8],[6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5],[7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Rows, Columns, and Blocks\nWe start by examining rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks to identify missing numbers. For example:\n- **Row 4**: [0, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 5]. Missing numbers are 2 and 9. Column 0 (where row 4, column 0 is empty) already contains 2 (row 6, column 0), so row 4, column 0 must be 9. This leaves row 4, column 7 as 2.\n- **Row 5**: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6]. Missing numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 8. By analyzing block 1,0 (rows 3-5, columns 0-2), we determine row 5, columns 1 and 2 must be 3 and 7. Further analysis fills row 5, columns 4 and 5 as 2 and 5.\n\n### Step 2: Fill Remaining Cells\nContinuing this process, we fill cells by checking constraints across rows, columns, and blocks. For example:\n- **Row 0**: [6, 1, 0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 0]. Missing numbers are 3, 7, 8, 9. By analyzing block 0,0 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) and column 2, we determine row 0, column 2 is 3. Further checks fill row 0, columns 3, 7, and 8 as 7, 9, and 8.\n- **Row 2**: [5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]. Missing numbers are 3, 4, 7, 9. By analyzing block 0,2 (rows 0-2, columns 6-8) and column 6, we determine row 2, columns 6 and 7 are 7 and 4.\n\n### Step 3: Verify All Constraints\nAfter filling all cells, we verify that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains numbers 1-9 without repetition.\n\n### Final Solution\nThe solved Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9, 8], [7, 4, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3], [5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2], [4, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7], [9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 5], [1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6], [2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4], [3, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1], [8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 2, 5, 9]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

By analyzing the middle-left block (rows 3-5, cols 0-2) and column 1, we determined row 3, column 1 = 4. Further deductions in the middle-middle block (rows 3-5, cols 3-5) and middle-right block (rows 3-5, cols 6-8) led to row 3 being completed as `[9, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8]`.\n\n2. **Row 6**: After solving row 3, row 6 had missing numbers 1, 3, 6, 7, 9. By analyzing the bottom-left block (rows 6-8, cols 0-2) and column 0, we set row 6, column 0 = 7. Further deductions in the bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, cols 3-5) and bottom-right block (rows 6-8, cols 6-8) led to row 6 being completed as `[7, 8, 9, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6]`.\n\n3. **Row 7**: Row 7 had missing numbers 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. By analyzing the bottom-left block (rows 6-8, cols 0-2) and column 0, we set row 7, column 0 = 4 and row 7, column 1 = 5. Further deductions in the bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, cols 3-5) and bottom-right block (rows 6-8, cols 6-8) led to row 7 being completed as `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.\n\n4. **Row 8**: Row 8 had missing numbers 2, 3, 7, 8, 9.

By analyzing the top-right block (rows 0-2, cols 6-8) and column 1, we set row 1, column 1 = 1 and row 1, column 2 = 2. Further deductions in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, cols 3-5) led to row 1 being completed as `[5, 1, 2, 8, 6, 7, 3, 9, 4]`.\n\n8. **Row 2**: Row 2 had missing numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 8.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Key Observations and Deductions:\n1. **Row 4**: Initially, row 4 is `[3, 0, 5, 2, 6, 0, 1, 4, 7]`. The missing numbers are 8 and 9. By analyzing column 5 (which already contains 9 in row 1), we determine that `(4,5)` (row 4, column 5) must be 8, and thus `(4,1)` (row 4, column 1) is 9. This gives row 4 as `[3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7]`.\n\n2. **Row 5**: Row 5 is `[2, 6, 0, 0, 4, 7, 3, 0, 5]`. The missing numbers are 1, 8, and 9. By analyzing block (1,2) (rows 3-5, columns 6-8), we find the only missing number is 9, so `(5,7)` (row 5, column 7) is 9. Further deductions show `(5,2)` (row 5, column 2) is 8 and `(5,3)` (row 5, column 3) is 1. This gives row 5 as `[2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5]`.\n\n3. **Row 3**: Row 3 is `[0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 8]`. Using block (1,0) (rows 3-5, columns 0-2), we determine `(3,0)` (row 3, column 0) is 1 and `(3,2)` (row 3, column 2) is 7. Analyzing block (1,1) (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) shows `(3,3)` (row 3, column 3) is 3, `(3,4)` (row 3, column 4) is 9, and `(3,5)` (row 3, column 5) is 5. This gives row 3 as `[1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8]`.\n\n4. **Row 7**: Row 7 is `[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1]`. By analyzing column 3 and block (2,1) (rows 6-8, columns 3-5), we determine `(7,3)` (row 7, column 3) is 9 and `(7,4)` (row 7, column 4) is 5. This gives row 7 as `[4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1]`.\n\n5. **Row 8**: Row 8 is `[0, 5, 2, 6, 0, 1, 4, 0, 0]`. Using column 4 and block (2,2) (rows 6-8, columns 6-8), we determine `(8,4)` (row 8, column 4) is 8 and `(8,8)` (row 8, column 8) is 3. This gives row 8 as `[9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3]`.\n\n6. **Row 6**: Row 6 is `[0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 5, 0]`. By analyzing block (2,0) (rows 6-8, columns 0-2) and block (2,1) (rows 6-8, columns 3-5), we determine `(6,5)` (row 6, column 5) is 3, `(6,6)` (row 6, column 6) is 9, and the remaining cells are filled to complete the row. This gives row 6 as `[6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2]`.\n\n7. **Row 0, 1, 2**: Using the remaining empty cells and ensuring no repetition in rows, columns, and blocks, we fill in the final values for rows 0, 1, and 2.\n\n### Final Solution:\nThe completed Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9],[8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6],[7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4],[1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8],[3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7],[2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5],[6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2],[4, 7, 3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1],[9, 5, 2, 6, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Key Observations and Deductions:\n1. **Block 5 (rows 3-5, cols 6-8)**: Initially, this block had missing numbers 1, 2, 3. By analyzing row 4 and column 6, we determined (4,6) = 3. This left 1 and 2 for (5,6) and (5,8), which were solved as (5,6) = 2 and (5,8) = 1.\n2. **Row 5**: After solving Block 5, row 5 had missing numbers 4, 5, 7. By analyzing column 4 and Block 4 (rows 3-5, cols 3-5), we determined (5,4) = 4, (5,1) = 7, and (5,2) = 5.\n3. **Row 3**: With row 5 filled, row 3 had missing numbers 3, 4, 9. By analyzing Block 3 (rows 3-5, cols 0-2) and column constraints, we solved (3,0) = 3, (3,1) = 4, and (3,2) = 9.\n4. **Row 4**: Using Block 4 and column constraints, we filled row 4 with (4,3) = 8, (4,4) = 7, and (4,5) = 5.\n5. **Row 2**: By analyzing row 2's missing numbers (2, 5, 7, 8) and Block 1 (rows 0-2, cols 3-5), we solved (2,0) = 5, (2,4) = 8, (2,7) = 2, and (2,8) = 7.\n6. **Row 6**: With row 2 filled, row 6's missing numbers (1, 2, 4, 7) were solved by analyzing Block 6 (rows 6-8, cols 0-2) and column constraints, resulting in (6,0) = 4, (6,2) = 2, (6,4) = 1, and (6,6) = 7.\n7. **Row 7**: Using Block 6 and column constraints, row 7 was filled with (7,0) = 6, (7,1) = 1, and (7,8) = 2.\n8. **Row 8**: By analyzing Block 7 (rows 6-8, cols 3-5) and Block 8 (rows 6-8, cols 6-8), we solved row 8 with (8,4) = 9, (8,5) = 2, (8,6) = 6, and (8,7) = 1.\n9. **Rows 0 and 1**: Finally, rows 0 and 1 were filled by solving remaining column and block constraints, ensuring all rows, columns, and blocks contain unique numbers 1-9.\n\n### Final Solution:\nThe solved Sudoku grid is as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[1, 2, 6, 5, 3, 7, 9, 8, 4],[9, 8, 7, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6],[5, 3, 4, 9, 8, 6, 1, 2, 7],[3, 4, 9, 2, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5],[2, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 9],[8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 9, 2, 6, 1],[4, 9, 2, 6, 1, 8, 7, 5, 3],[6, 1, 8, 7, 5, 3, 4, 9, 2],[7, 5, 3, 4, 9, 2, 6, 1, 8]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Rows, Columns, and Blocks\nStart by identifying missing numbers in rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks. For example, in row 0, the missing numbers are 3, 4, 9. By checking the corresponding column and block constraints, we determine the values for these cells.\n\n### Step 2: Fill In Easy Candidates\nLook for cells with only one possible value based on row, column, and block constraints. For instance, row 0, column 8 (cell (0,8)) can only be 2 because column 8 already contains 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and row 0 cannot have 1 or 6.\n\n### Step 3: Use Process of Elimination\nFor cells with multiple candidates, eliminate values that are already present in the same row, column, or block. For example, in row 1, column 1 (cell (1,1)), the missing numbers in the block (0,0) are 2, 4, 8, 9. Since row 1 already contains 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, the only valid candidate is 8.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Completion\nContinue filling cells using the above methods until all rows, columns, and blocks are complete. Verify each step to ensure no duplicates exist.\n\n### Final Solution\nThe completed Sudoku grid is as follows:\n\nAnswer: [[9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7, 2], [5, 8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1], [6, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 3], [7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 3, 6], [8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5], [4, 1, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9], [2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7], [3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8], [1, 5, 8, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 4]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

For example:\n- **Row 0** has missing numbers 1, 5, 9. By checking the column and block constraints, we determine (0,1)=9, (0,3)=5, and (0,8)=1.\n- **Row 1** has missing numbers 1, 6, 8, 9. Using block (0,1) constraints, we find (1,3)=6, (1,5)=1, (1,6)=8, and (1,7)=9.\n- **Row 2** has missing numbers 5, 9. By analyzing the column and block, we set (2,4)=9 and (2,6)=5.\n\n### Step 2: Fill in Key Cells\nContinuing with other rows:\n- **Row 3** has missing numbers 2, 3, 6, 8. Using column 3 constraints, (3,3)=2. Further analysis gives (3,4)=3, (3,5)=6, and (3,8)=8.\n- **Row 4** has missing numbers 1, 7, 9. Using block (1,1) constraints, (4,3)=7, (4,4)=1, and (4,6)=9.\n- **Row 5** has missing numbers 2, 3, 4. Using block (1,2) constraints, (5,4)=4, (5,6)=2, and (5,7)=3.\n\n### Step 3: Finalize Remaining Cells\nFor the last rows:\n- **Row 6** has missing numbers 1, 6, 9. Using column 0 and block (2,0) constraints, (6,0)=1, (6,2)=9, and (6,7)=6.\n- **Row 7** has missing numbers 1, 2, 6. Using column 2 and block (2,0) constraints, (7,2)=2, (7,4)=6, and (7,6)=1.\n- **Row 8** has missing numbers 5, 8, 9. Using block (2,1) constraints, (8,4)=8, (8,5)=9, and (8,7)=5.\n\n### Final Solution\nThe completed Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[8,9,4,5,2,3,6,7,1],[5,2,3,6,7,1,8,9,4],[6,7,1,8,9,4,5,2,3],[9,4,5,2,3,6,7,1,8],[2,3,6,7,1,8,9,4,5],[7,1,8,9,4,5,2,3,6],[1,8,9,4,5,2,3,6,7],[4,5,2,3,6,7,1,8,9],[3,6,7,1,8,9,4,5,2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

This resolves row 8 to [7, 5, 6, 3, 8, 2, 1, 9, 4].\n\n8. **Row 1**: The row is [5, 6, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 4, 7]. Missing numbers are 2, 3, 8, 9. By analyzing the 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2) and column constraints, we determine the missing values in column 2 (2), column 3 (8), and column 4 (9). This resolves row 1 to [5, 6, 2, 8, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7].\n\n9. **Row 0**: The row is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Missing numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. By analyzing the remaining constraints across rows, columns, and blocks, we determine the missing values as [8, 1, 3, 9, 4, 7, 5, 6, 2].\n\n### Final Solution:\nAnswer: [[8,1,3,9,4,7,5,6,2],[5,6,2,8,9,1,3,4,7],[9,4,7,5,6,3,8,2,1],[4,7,5,6,3,8,2,1,9],[2,1,9,4,7,5,6,3,8],[6,3,8,2,1,9,4,7,5],[1,9,4,7,5,6,3,8,2],[3,8,2,1,4,9,7,5,6],[7,5,6,3,8,2,1,9,4]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.

Here's the step-by-step solution:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Rows, Columns, and Blocks\nWe start by identifying missing numbers in each row, column, and 3x3 block. For example:\n- **Row 0** has missing numbers: 1, 3, 4, 9.\n- **Column 0** has missing numbers: 2, 4, 7, 8, 9.\n- **Block (0,0)** (top-left 3x3) has missing numbers: 2, 3, 4, 7.\n\n### Step 2: Deduce Values for Key Cells\nBy cross-referencing constraints from rows, columns, and blocks, we deduce values for specific cells:\n- **Row 4, Column 0** (cell (4,0)) is determined to be 9 (since column 0 and row 4 constraints overlap).\n- **Row 3, Column 0** (cell (3,0)) is 2 (fills the only valid missing number in column 0 and row 3).\n- **Row 1, Column 2** (cell (1,2)) is 7 (completes the missing number in block (0,0) and row 1).\n\n### Step 3: Complete Rows and Columns\nContinuing this process, we fill in remaining cells by ensuring no duplicates in rows, columns, or blocks:\n- **Row 0** is completed with [4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7].\n- **Row 2** is completed with [5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6].\n- **Row 5** is completed with [3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4].\n\n### Step 4: Verify All Constraints\nFinally, we verify that all rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks contain numbers 1-9 without repetition.\n\n### Solution Grid\nThe completed Sudoku grid is:\n\nAnswer: [[4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7], [1, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8], [5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6], [2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1], [9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 5], [3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4], [8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9], [6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 7, 4, 3], [7, 4, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1, 2]]"],"prompt":"\nYou are a good game player, I'll give you a game board and rules.\nYour task is:\n- First, give your answer according to the game board and rules.\n- Second, output the answer in the required format.
