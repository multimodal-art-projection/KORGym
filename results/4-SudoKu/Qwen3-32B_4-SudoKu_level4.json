      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. I need to fill in the zeros with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 block has all numbers without repetition. Let me start by looking at the given board.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the current board to visualize it better. The rows are:\n\nRow 0: [4, 3, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]\nRow 1: [0, 1, 8, 6, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 8]\nRow 3: [1, 8, 0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6]\nRow 5: [3, 7, 2, 0, 8, 0, 5, 9, 0]\nRow 6: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3]\nRow 7: [9, 4, 0, 7, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [8, 6, 5, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLet me look for cells that have only one possible number. Let's check each row, column, and block.\n\nStarting with Row 0. The existing numbers are 4,3,7,2,9. Missing are 1,5,6,8. Let's look at each zero in Row 0:\n\nPosition (0,4): Column 4. Let's see what's in column 4. Column 4 has 0,0,3,9,7,8,0,2,4. Wait, let me check each column properly. Maybe I should make a note of existing numbers in each column and block.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with cells that have the fewest possibilities. Let me check Row 0, column 4 (cell (0,4)). The row has 4,3,7,2, missing 1,5,6,8. Column 4: existing numbers in column 4 are:\n\nRow 0: 0 (current cell)\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 3\nRow 3: 9\nRow 4: 7\nRow 5: 8\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 2\nRow 8: 4\n\nSo existing numbers in column 4 are 3,9,7,8,2,4. Missing are 1,5,6. Also, the cell is in block (0,0) to (2,2)? Wait, blocks are 3x3. Let me figure out the blocks. Block 0 is rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Block 1 is rows 0-2, columns 3-5. Block 2 is rows 0-2, columns 6-8. Similarly for other blocks.\n\nSo cell (0,4) is in block 1 (columns 3-5). Let's check block 1. Block 1 includes:\n\nRow 0: columns 3-5: 2, 0, 0\nRow 1: columns 3-5: 6, 0, 9\nRow 2: columns 3-5: 4, 3, 0\n\nExisting numbers in block 1: 2,6,9,4,3. Missing are 1,5,7,8. Wait, but the row's missing numbers are 1,5,6,8? Wait no, row 0's existing numbers are 4,3,7,2,9. So missing are 1,5,6,8. But column 4's missing are 1,5,6. So possible numbers for cell (0,4) must be in the intersection of row's missing (1,5,6,8), column's missing (1,5,6), and block's missing (1,5,7,8). So intersection is 1,5. Because column's missing is 1,5,6 and block's missing is 1,5,7,8. So possible numbers are 1 and 5. Hmm, not helpful yet. Let's check another cell.\n\nLooking for cells with only one possibility. Let's check Row 2. Row 2 is [0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 8]. Missing numbers in row 2 are 5,6,7. Let's check column 0 for row 2, cell (2,0). Column 0 has 4,0,0,1,0,3,7,9,8. Existing numbers: 4,1,3,7,9,8. Missing 2,5,6. But row 2's missing are 5,6,7. So possible numbers for (2,0) are 5,6. Because column 0's missing includes 5,6. Also check block. Cell (2,0) is in block 0 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Block 0's existing numbers: row 0 has 4,3,7; row 1 has 0,1,8; row 2 has 0,0,9. Existing numbers in block 0: 4,3,7,1,8,9. Missing are 2,5,6. So possible numbers for (2,0) are 5,6. Still two options. Not helpful yet.\n\nLet me check Row 3: [1, 8, 0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0]. Missing numbers in row 3: 2,5,6. Let's look at cell (3,2) (third column). Column 2: existing numbers are 7,8,9,0,0,2,0,0,5. Let me check column 2. Column 2:\n\nRow 0: 7\nRow 1: 8\nRow 2: 9\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 2\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 5\n\nSo existing numbers: 7,8,9,2,5. Missing: 1,3,4,6. But row 3's missing are 2,5,6. Wait, row 3's missing numbers are 2,5,6? Wait row 3 is [1,8,0,0,9,4,3,7,0]. The existing numbers in row 3 are 1,8,9,4,3,7. Missing are 2,5,6. So cell (3,2) must be one of 2,5,6. But column 2's missing are 1,3,4,6. So intersection is 6. Therefore, cell (3,2) must be 6. Because it's the only common number. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes! So cell (3,2) is 6. Let me update row 3 to [1,8,6, ...]. Now, row 3's missing numbers are 2 and 5 for the remaining cells. Let me note that.\n\nNow, row 3 becomes [1,8,6, 0,9,4,3,7,0]. The remaining zeros are in columns 3 and 8. Let's check column 3 for cell (3,3). Column 3 has existing numbers:\n\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1: 6\nRow 2: 4\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 3\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 7\nRow 8: 0\n\nSo existing in column 3: 2,6,4,3,7. Missing are 1,5,8,9. But row 3's missing are 2,5. Wait, row 3's missing after adding 6 are 2 and 5. So cell (3,3) must be 2 or 5. Let's check the block. Cell (3,3) is in block 3 (rows 3-5, columns 0-2?), no. Wait, blocks are:\n\nBlock 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2\nBlock 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5\nBlock 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8\nBlock 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2\nBlock 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5\nBlock 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8\nBlock 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2\nBlock 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5\nBlock 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8\n\nSo cell (3,3) is in block 4 (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Let's check block 4. Existing numbers in block 4:\n\nRow 3: columns 3-5: 0,9,4 (but cell (3,3) is 0, but after we filled 6 in row 3, column 2, but block 4 includes columns 3-5. Let me check the current state of block 4. Before any changes, block 4 includes:\n\nRow 3: columns 3-5: 0 (cell (3,3)), 9, 4\nRow 4: columns 3-5: 3,7,0\nRow 5: columns 3-5: 0,8,0\n\nExisting numbers in block 4: 9,4,3,7,8. Missing are 1,2,5,6. But cell (3,3) is in row 3, which has missing 2 and 5. So possible numbers for (3,3) are 2 or 5. Let's see if column 3 allows it. Column 3's existing numbers include 2 (row 0), 6 (row 1), 4 (row 2), 3 (row 4), 7 (row 7). So if cell (3,3) is 2, then column 3 would have 2 again (row 0 already has 2). Wait no, row 0's column 3 is 2. If cell (3,3) is 2, then column 3 would have two 2s. That's invalid. Therefore, 2 is not allowed here. Therefore, cell (3,3) must be 5. Because it's the only remaining option. Let me check that. Column 3 currently doesn't have a 5. So yes, 5 is allowed. So cell (3,3) is 5. Now, row 3 becomes [1,8,6,5,9,4,3,7,0]. The last zero is in column 8 (cell (3,8)). Row 3's missing number is 2. So cell (3,8) must be 2. Let's check column 8. Column 8 has existing numbers: 9 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 8 (row 2), 0 (row 3 now 2?), wait original column 8:\n\nOriginal column 8:\n\nRow 0: 9\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 8\nRow 3: 0 (now 2)\nRow 4: 6\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 3\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\n\nSo adding 2 in row 3, column 8 is okay. No conflict. Also check block 5 (rows 3-5, columns 6-8). Block 5 includes:\n\nRow 3: columns 6-8: 3,7,2 (after filling)\nRow 4: columns 6-8: 1,8,6\nRow 5: columns 6-8: 5,9, 0.\n\nSo existing numbers in block 5: 3,7,2,1,8,6,5,9. Missing is 4? Wait, no. Wait block 5's numbers should be 1-9. Let me list all existing numbers: 3,7,2,1,8,6,5,9. Missing is 4. But cell (3,8) is 2, which is already in the block. Wait, no. Wait, cell (3,8) is 2, but block 5's existing numbers include 2. So that's okay. So no problem. So row 3 is now filled as [1,8,6,5,9,4,3,7,2].\n\nGreat progress. Let's move on.\n\nNow, looking at Row 1: [0, 1, 8, 6, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0]. Missing numbers in row 1: let's see existing numbers are 1,8,6,9,4,3. Missing are 2,5,7. Let's check cell (1,0). Column 0 has existing numbers: 4,0 (row1), 0 (row2), 1, 0, 3, 7, 9, 8. So column 0's existing numbers are 4,1,3,7,9,8. Missing are 2,5,6. But row1's missing are 2,5,7. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 2 or 5 (since 7 is not in column 0's missing). Wait column 0's missing are 2,5,6. But row1's missing are 2,5,7. So intersection is 2 and 5. Also check block 0 (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Block 0's existing numbers: row 0 has 4,3,7; row 1 has (cell (1,0) is 0, but other cells are 1,8; row 2 has (cells 0 and 1 are 0, then 9). So existing numbers in block 0: 4,3,7,1,8,9. Missing are 2,5,6. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 2,5. Let's see if there's another cell in row1 that can help.\n\nLooking at cell (1,4) (row1, column4). Column4's existing numbers: let me check. Column4:\n\nRow0: 0 (original was 0, but after solving row3, etc., maybe other cells have changed? Wait, no, so far only row3 was changed. So column4 remains as before except for any changes. Let me recheck column4:\n\nRow0: 0 (cell (0,4)), but we haven't filled that yet. Row1's cell (1,4) is 0. Row2's cell (2,4) is 3. Row3's cell (3,4) is 9. Row4's cell (4,4) is 7. Row5's cell (5,4) is 8. Row6's cell (6,4) is 0. Row7's cell (7,4) is 2. Row8's cell (8,4) is 4.\n\nSo existing numbers in column4: 3,9,7,8,2,4. Missing are 1,5,6. Row1's missing in row are 2,5,7. So cell (1,4) must be in the intersection of row1's missing (2,5,7) and column4's missing (1,5,6). The intersection is 5. So cell (1,4) must be 5. Let me check block. Cell (1,4) is in block1 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Block1's existing numbers include 2 (row0, column3), 6 (row1, column3), 9 (row1, column5), 4 (row2, column3), 3 (row2, column4), and 0 (row0, column4 and 5). After adding 5 here, block1's existing numbers would include 5. Let me confirm. So cell (1,4) is 5. Now, row1 becomes [0,1,8,6,5,9,4,3,0]. Now, row1's missing numbers are 2 and 7. Let's look at cell (1,0) again. Now, column0's existing numbers are 4, (row1, column0: 0), 0 (row2), 1, 0, 3, 7, 9, 8. Missing 2,5,6. But row1's missing are 2 and 7. So cell (1,0) can only be 2, since 7 is not in column0's missing. Therefore, cell (1,0) is 2. Then, the last missing in row1 is 7 in cell (1,8). Let's check column8. Column8 has existing numbers: 9 (row0), 0 (row1), 8 (row2), 2 (row3), 6 (row4), 0 (row5), 3 (row6), 0 (row7), 0 (row8). So adding 7 in row1, column8 is allowed. Also check block2 (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Block2's existing numbers include row0's [0,0,9], but row0's columns 6-8 are [0,0,9]. Wait, row0's current state is [4,3,7,2,0,0, 0, 0, 9]. So columns 6-8 are 0, 0, 9. Row1's columns 6-8 are 4,3,0 (now 0 becomes 7). So block2's existing numbers would include 9, 4, 3, 7. No conflicts. So cell (1,8) is 7. Now, row1 is [2,1,8,6,5,9,4,3,7].\n\nGreat! Now row1 is filled. Let me update the board.\n\nNow, looking at row0: [4,3,7,2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9]. Let's see what's missing. Existing numbers: 4,3,7,2,9. Missing are 1,5,6,8. Let's check column4 for cell (0,4). Column4 now has existing numbers: row1's 5, row2's 3, row3's 9, row4's 7, row5's 8, row7's 2, row8's 4. So column4 has 5,3,9,7,8,2,4. Missing are 1,6. So cell (0,4) can be 1 or 6. Also check block1 (rows 0-2, columns3-5). Block1's existing numbers: row0's columns3-5 are 2, ?, ?. But row1's columns3-5 are 6,5,9. Row2's columns3-5 are 4,3,0. Wait, row2's column5 is 0. So existing in block1: 2,6,5,9,4,3. Missing are 1,7,8. But row0's missing in row are 1,5,6,8. So cell (0,4) must be in the intersection of column4's missing (1,6) and block1's missing (1,7,8). So only 1. Therefore, cell (0,4) is 1. Now, row0 becomes [4,3,7,2,1, 0, 0, 0, 9]. Now, missing in row0 are 5,6,8. Let's look at cell (0,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers: row0's cell (0,5) is 0, row1's is 9, row2's is 0, row3's is 4, row4's is 0, row5's is 0, row6's is 5, row7's is 1, row8's is 3. Let me list column5's existing numbers: 9,4,5,1,3. Missing are 2,6,7,8. But row0's missing are 5,6,8. So cell (0,5) must be one of 5,6,8. However, column5's missing are 2,6,7,8. So intersection is 6,8. Also check block1 (rows0-2, columns3-5). Block1's existing numbers now include 2,1 (from cell (0,4)), 6,5,9,4,3. Missing are 7,8. So cell (0,5) must be in the intersection of row's missing (5,6,8), column's missing (6,8), and block's missing (7,8). The only common number is 8. Therefore, cell (0,5) is 8. Now, row0 becomes [4,3,7,2,1,8, 0, 0, 9]. Missing in row0 are 5 and 6. Let's check columns for cells (0,6) and (0,7).\n\nCell (0,6) is column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0: 0, row1:4, row2:2, row3:3, row4:1, row5:5, row6:9, row7:0, row8:0. Existing numbers: 4,2,3,1,5,9. Missing are 6,7,8. Row0's missing are 5,6. Wait row0's missing now are 5 and 6. So cell (0,6) must be 5 or 6. Let's check block2 (rows0-2, columns6-8). Block2's existing numbers: row0's columns6-8: 0, 0, 9; row1's columns6-8: 4,3,7; row2's columns6-8: 2,1,8. Existing numbers: 9,4,3,7,2,1,8. Missing are 5,6. So cell (0,6) can be 5 or 6. Let me check column6 again. Column6's missing are 6,7,8. So if cell (0,6) is 5, that's not allowed. Wait, no. Wait column6's existing numbers are 4,2,3,1,5,9. So missing are 6,7,8. Therefore, cell (0,6) must be one of 6,7,8. But row0's missing are 5 and 6. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, row0's missing numbers after filling cell (0,5)=8 are 5 and 6. But cell (0,6) is in column6 which can only take 6,7,8. Therefore, cell (0,6) must be 6. Because 6 is in both row's missing and column's possible. Then cell (0,7) would be 5. Let me check.\n\nIf cell (0,6) is 6, then column6 has 6 added. Now, row0's missing is 5. So cell (0,7) must be 5. Let's check column7. Column7's existing numbers: row0: 0, row1:3, row2:1, row3:7, row4:8, row5:9, row6:4, row7:0, row8:0. Existing numbers: 3,1,7,8,9,4. Missing are 2,5,6. So cell (0,7) is 5, which is allowed. Also check block2. Block2's missing are 5 and 6. If cell (0,6)=6 and (0,7)=5, then that fills both. So yes. Therefore, row0 becomes [4,3,7,2,1,8,6,5,9]. Now, row0 is complete.\n\nGreat! Now the board is updated. Let's check Row2: [0, 0, 9, 4, 3, 0, 2, 1, 8]. Missing numbers in row2: existing are 9,4,3,2,1,8. Missing are 5,6,7. Let's check cell (2,0) and (2,1), (2,5). Let's check column0 for cell (2,0). Column0's existing numbers: 4 (row0), 2 (row1), 0 (row2), 1 (row3), 0 (row4), 3 (row5), 7 (row6), 9 (row7), 8 (row8). Missing are 5,6. Row2's missing are 5,6,7. So possible numbers for (2,0) are 5 or 6. Also check block0 (rows0-2, columns0-2). Block0's existing numbers: row0 has 4,3,7; row1 has 2,1,8; row2 has ?, ?, 9. Existing numbers: 4,3,7,2,1,8,9. Missing are 5,6. So cell (2,0) can be 5 or 6. Let's look for other clues. Let's check cell (2,1). Column1's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:1, row2:0, row3:8, row4:0, row5:7, row6:0, row7:4, row8:6. Existing numbers: 3,1,8,7,4,6. Missing are 2,5,9. Row2's missing are 5,6,7. So cell (2,1) must be in the intersection of row's missing (5,6,7) and column's missing (2,5,9). Only 5. Therefore, cell (2,1) is 5. Now, row2 becomes [0,5,9,4,3,0,2,1,8]. Now, missing in row2 are 6 and 7. Let's look at cell (2,0). Now, row2's missing are 6 and 7. Column0's missing are 5,6. Wait, column0's existing numbers are 4,2,1,3,7,9,8. Missing are 5,6. So cell (2,0) can be 5 or 6. But row2's missing are 6 and 7. So if cell (2,0) is 6, then row2's remaining missing is 7. Let's check block0. Block0's missing are 5 and 6. If cell (2,0) is 6, then block0's missing would be 5. Let me check if that's possible. Also, check column0 for 6. Column0 currently doesn't have 6. So yes. So cell (2,0) is 6. Then, cell (2,5) must be 7. Let me check column5. Column5's existing numbers: row0:8, row1:9, row2:0 (now 7?), row3:4, row4:0, row5:0, row6:5, row7:1, row8:3. So adding 7 here is allowed. Also check block1 (row2, column5 is in block1). Block1's existing numbers: row0's columns3-5 are 2,1,8; row1's 6,5,9; row2's 4,3,7. So all numbers 1-9 are present. So yes. Therefore, row2 becomes [6,5,9,4,3,7,2,1,8]. Now row2 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at row4: [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6]. Existing numbers: 3,7,1,8,6. Missing are 2,4,5,9. Let's check each cell. Let's look for cells with unique possibilities. Let's check column0 for cell (4,0). Column0's existing numbers: 4,2,6,1, ?, 3,7,9,8. Missing are 5. Wait, column0's existing numbers are 4 (row0), 2 (row1), 6 (row2), 1 (row3), ?, 3 (row5), 7 (row6), 9 (row7), 8 (row8). So missing in column0 are 5. Therefore, cell (4,0) must be 5. So row4 becomes [5, 0, 0, 3, 7, 0, 1, 8, 6]. Now, row4's missing are 2,4,9. Let's check cell (4,1). Column1's existing numbers: 3 (row0), 1 (row1), 5 (row2), 8 (row3), 0, 7 (row5), 0 (row6), 4 (row7), 6 (row8). Existing: 3,1,5,8,7,4,6. Missing are 2,9. Row4's missing are 2,4,9. So cell (4,1) must be in intersection of 2,9 and row's missing. So 2 or 9. Let's check block3 (rows3-5, columns0-2). Block3 includes row4's columns0-2: 5, 0, 0. Existing numbers in block3: row3's columns0-2: 1,8,6; row4's columns0-2: 5, ?, ?; row5's columns0-2: 3,7,2. Existing numbers: 1,8,6,5,3,7,2. Missing are 4,9. So cell (4,1) must be 4 or 9. But column1's missing are 2 and 9. So intersection is 9. Therefore, cell (4,1) is 9. Now, row4 becomes [5,9, 0, 3,7, 0, 1,8,6]. Now, missing in row4 are 2 and 4. Let's check cell (4,2). Column2's existing numbers: 7 (row0), 8 (row1), 9 (row2), 6 (row3), 0, 2 (row5), 0 (row6), 0 (row7), 5 (row8). Existing: 7,8,9,6,2,5. Missing are 1,3,4. Row4's missing are 2 and 4. So cell (4,2) must be 4 (since 2 is not in column2's missing). Let me check. Column2's existing numbers include 2? Yes, row5 has 2 in column2. So cell (4,2) can't be 2. So it must be 4. So cell (4,2) is 4. Now, row4 becomes [5,9,4,3,7, 0, 1,8,6]. Missing in row4 is 2. So cell (4,5) is 2. Let me check column5. Column5's existing numbers: 8 (row0), 9 (row1), 7 (row2), 4 (row3), 0 (row4 now 2), 0 (row5), 5 (row6), 1 (row7), 3 (row8). Adding 2 is allowed. Also check block4 (rows3-5, columns3-5). Block4's existing numbers: row3's columns3-5:5,9,4; row4's columns3-5:3,7,2; row5's columns3-5:0,8,0. Existing numbers: 5,9,4,3,7,2,8. Missing are 1,6. But cell (4,5) is 2 which is allowed. So yes. So row4 is now [5,9,4,3,7,2,1,8,6]. Row4 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at row5: [3,7,2, 0,8, 0,5,9, 0]. Existing numbers:3,7,2,8,5,9. Missing are 1,4,6. Let's check cell (5,3) (column3). Column3's existing numbers: row0:2, row1:6, row2:4, row3:5, row4:3, row5:0, row6:0, row7:7, row8:0. Existing: 2,6,4,5,3,7. Missing are 1,8,9. Row5's missing are 1,4,6. So cell (5,3) must be in intersection of column's missing (1,8,9) and row's missing (1,4,6). Only 1. So cell (5,3) is 1. Now, row5 becomes [3,7,2,1,8, 0,5,9, 0]. Missing are 4 and 6. Let's check cell (5,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers: 8,9,7,4,2, ?, 5,1,3. Existing: 8,9,7,4,2,5,1,3. Missing are 6. Therefore, cell (5,5) must be 6. Now, row5 becomes [3,7,2,1,8,6,5,9, 0]. Missing in row5 is 4. So cell (5,8) must be 4. Let me check column8. Column8's existing numbers: 9 (row0),7 (row1),8 (row2),2 (row3),6 (row4),0 (row5 now 4),3 (row6),0 (row7),0 (row8). Adding 4 is allowed. Also check block5 (rows3-5, columns6-8). Block5's existing numbers: row3:3,7,2; row4:1,8,6; row5:5,9,4. All numbers present. So yes. So row5 is [3,7,2,1,8,6,5,9,4]. Complete.\n\nNow, moving to row6: [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3]. Existing numbers:7,5,9,4,3. Missing are 1,2,6,8. Let's look for cells with unique possibilities. Let's check cell (6,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers:3 (row0),1 (row1),5 (row2),8 (row3),9 (row4),7 (row5),0 (row6),4 (row7),6 (row8). Existing: 3,1,5,8,9,7,4,6. Missing is 2. Therefore, cell (6,1) must be 2. Now, row6 becomes [7,2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3]. Missing are 1,6,8. Let's check cell (6,2) (column2). Column2's existing numbers:7 (row0),8 (row1),9 (row2),6 (row3),4 (row4),2 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),5 (row8). Existing:7,8,9,6,4,2,5. Missing are 1,3. But row6's missing are 1,6,8. So cell (6,2) must be 1. Because it's the only common. Let me check block6 (rows6-8, columns0-2). Block6's existing numbers: row6:7,2,?; row7:9,4,?; row8:8,6,5. Existing numbers:7,2,9,4,8,6,5. Missing are 1,3. So cell (6,2) is 1. Now, row6 becomes [7,2,1, 0, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3]. Missing are 6 and 8. Let's check cell (6,3) (column3). Column3's existing numbers:2,6,4,5,3,1,0 (row6),7,0. Existing:2,6,4,5,3,1,7. Missing are 8,9. Row6's missing are 6 and 8. So cell (6,3) must be 8. Because 8 is in column's missing. Now, row6 becomes [7,2,1,8, 0, 5, 9, 4, 3]. Missing in row6 is 6. So cell (6,4) is 6. Let me check column4. Column4's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:5, row2:3, row3:9, row4:7, row5:8, row6:6, row7:2, row8:4. All numbers from 1-9 are present. So yes, adding 6 here is okay. So row6 is [7,2,1,8,6,5,9,4,3]. Complete.\n\nNow, row7: [9,4, 0, 7, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Existing numbers:9,4,7,2,1. Missing are 3,5,6,8. Let's check cell (7,2) (column2). Column2's existing numbers:7,8,9,6,4,2,1, ?, 5. Existing:7,8,9,6,4,2,1,5. Missing is 3. Therefore, cell (7,2) must be 3. Now, row7 becomes [9,4,3,7,2,1, 0, 0, 0]. Missing are 5,6,8. Let's check cell (7,6) (column6). Column6's existing numbers:6 (row0),4 (row1),2 (row2),3 (row3),1 (row4),5 (row5),9 (row6), 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing:6,4,2,3,1,5,9. Missing are 7,8. But row7's missing are 5,6,8. So cell (7,6) must be 8. Let me check block7 (rows6-8, columns3-5). Block7 includes row7's columns3-5:7,2,1. Existing numbers in block7: row6's columns3-5:8,6,5; row7's columns3-5:7,2,1; row8's columns3-5:0,4,3. Existing numbers:8,6,5,7,2,1,4,3. Missing are 9. Wait, but cell (7,6) is column6, which is part of block7? No, block7 is columns3-5. Cell (7,6) is column6, which is part of block8 (columns6-8). Let me check block8 (rows6-8, columns6-8). Block8's existing numbers: row6:9,4,3; row7: ?, ?, ?; row8: ?, ?, ?. Let's focus on cell (7,6). Column6's missing are 7,8. But row7's missing are 5,6,8. So cell (7,6) must be 8. Let me check block8. Block8 includes row7's columns6-8. Existing in block8 from row6:9,4,3. So adding 8 in cell (7,6) is allowed. Now, row7 becomes [9,4,3,7,2,1,8, 0, 0]. Missing are 5 and 6. Let's check cell (7,7) (column7). Column7's existing numbers:5 (row0),3 (row1),1 (row2),7 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),4 (row6), 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing:5,3,1,7,8,9,4. Missing are 2,6. Row7's missing are 5,6. So cell (7,7) must be 6. Let me check block8. Block8's existing numbers: row7's columns6-8:8, ?, ?. Adding 6 here is allowed. Now, row7 becomes [9,4,3,7,2,1,8,6, 0]. Missing is 5. So cell (7,8) is 5. Let me check column8. Column8's existing numbers:9,7,8,2,6,4,3, 0, 0. Adding 5 is allowed. So row7 is [9,4,3,7,2,1,8,6,5]. Complete.\n\nFinally, row8: [8,6,5, 0,4,3, 0, 0, 0]. Existing numbers:8,6,5,4,3. Missing are 1,2,7,9. Let's check cell (8,3) (column3). Column3's existing numbers:2,6,4,5,3,1,8,7, ?. Existing:2,6,4,5,3,1,8,7. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (8,3) must be 9. Now, row8 becomes [8,6,5,9,4,3, 0, 0, 0]. Missing are 1,2,7. Let's check cell (8,6) (column6). Column6's existing numbers:6 (row0),4 (row1),2 (row2),3 (row3),1 (row4),5 (row5),9 (row6),8 (row7), ?. Existing:6,4,2,3,1,5,9,8. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (8,6) is 7. Now, row8 becomes [8,6,5,9,4,3,7, 0, 0]. Missing are 1 and 2. Let's check cell (8,7) (column7). Column7's existing numbers:5 (row0),3 (row1),1 (row2),7 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),4 (row6),6 (row7), ?. Existing:5,3,1,7,8,9,4,6. Missing is 2. Therefore, cell (8,7) is 2. Now, row8 becomes [8,6,5,9,4,3,7,2, 0]. Missing is 1. So cell (8,8) is 1. Let me check column8. Column8 has existing numbers:9,7,8,2,6,4,3,5, 0. Adding 1 is allowed. Also check block8. Block8's existing numbers: row7's columns6-8:8,6,5; row8's columns6-8:7,2,1. All numbers present. So yes. So row8 is [8,6,5,9,4,3,7,2,1].

    "response": [
      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. Hmm, first I need to look at the given board and figure out where the zeros are and what numbers can fit there. Let me start by writing down the current board to visualize it better.\n\nThe initial board is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 3, 7, 0, 0, 8, 4, 1, 9]\nRow 1: [2, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0]\nRow 2: [0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 7, 0, 6, 8]\nRow 3: [0, 9, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 0, 4]\nRow 4: [3, 7, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]\nRow 5: [0, 8, 4, 0, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0]\nRow 6: [9, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 8, 4, 0]\nRow 7: [7, 2, 0, 8, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [8, 4, 1, 0, 0, 3, 7, 2, 6]\n\nAlright, Sudoku rules say each row, column, and 3x3 block must have numbers 1-9 without repetition. Let me start by looking for cells that have only one possible number. \n\nStarting with Row 0. The first cell is 0. Let's check what's missing in this row. The existing numbers are 3,7,8,4,1,9. Missing are 2,5,6. Now, column 0: looking at column 0, existing numbers are 2,0,0,0,3,0,9,7,8. Wait, column 0 has 2 (row1), 3 (row4), 9 (row6), 7 (row7), 8 (row8). So missing in column 0 are 1,4,5,6? Wait, no. Wait, column 0 is the first element of each row. Let me list them:\n\nRow0: 0\nRow1: 2\nRow2: 0\nRow3: 0\nRow4: 3\nRow5: 0\nRow6: 9\nRow7: 7\nRow8: 8\n\nSo existing numbers in column 0 are 2,3,7,8,9. Missing are 1,4,5,6. Also, the 3x3 block for row 0, column 0 is the top-left block. The block includes rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. Let's see existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow0: [0,3,7]\nRow1: [2,0,8]\nRow2: [0,1,9]\n\nSo existing numbers in the block are 3,7,2,8,1,9. Missing are 4,5,6. So for cell (0,0), which is row0, column0, possible numbers are the intersection of row missing (2,5,6), column missing (1,4,5,6), and block missing (4,5,6). The intersection is 5 and 6. Hmm, not unique. Maybe another cell is easier.\n\nLooking at row 0, column 3 is 0. Let's check. Row 0's existing numbers are 3,7,8,4,1,9. Missing are 2,5,6. Column 3: existing numbers are row0:0, row1:0, row2:5, row3:3, row4:6, row5:0, row6:0, row7:8, row8:0. Let me list column 3:\n\nRow0: 0\nRow1: 0\nRow2: 5\nRow3: 3\nRow4: 6\nRow5: 0\nRow6: 0\nRow7: 8\nRow8: 0\n\nSo existing numbers in column 3 are 5,3,6,8. Missing are 1,2,4,7,9. Wait, but row0's missing numbers are 2,5,6. Wait, for cell (0,3), possible numbers must be in row0's missing (2,5,6), column3's missing (1,2,4,7,9?), and the block. Wait, block for (0,3) is top-middle block (columns 3-5). Let me check that block. It includes rows 0-2, columns 3-5. Existing numbers:\n\nRow0 columns 3-5: 0, 0, 8\nRow1 columns 3-5: 0,1,0\nRow2 columns 3-5:5,0,7\n\nSo existing numbers in that block are 8,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,4,6,9. So possible numbers for (0,3) must be in row0's missing (2,5,6), column3's missing (1,2,4,7,9?), but column3's existing numbers include 5,3,6,8. Wait, column3's existing numbers are 5 (row2), 3 (row3?), no, wait column3 is for each row. Let me recheck column3 again.\n\nWait, column3 is the fourth column. For each row:\n\nRow0 column3 is 0 (original data is [0,3,7,0,0,8,4,1,9])\nRow1 column3 is 0 (row1 is [2,0,8,0,1,0,0,3,0])\nRow2 column3 is 5 (row2: [0,1,9,5,0,7,0,6,8])\nRow3 column3 is 3 (row3: [0,9,5,3,7,2,6,0,4])\nRow4 column3 is 6 (row4: [3,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,5])\nRow5 column3 is 0 (row5: [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0])\nRow6 column3 is 0 (row6: [9,0,3,0,2,0,8,4,0])\nRow7 column3 is 8 (row7: [7,2,0,8,4,1,9,0,0])\nRow8 column3 is 0 (row8: [8,4,1,0,0,3,7,2,6])\n\nSo existing numbers in column3 are 5,3,6,8. So missing in column3 are 1,2,4,7,9. So for cell (0,3), possible numbers are in row0's missing (2,5,6) intersect column3's missing (1,2,4,7,9) → only 2. Also check block. The block (top-middle) has missing numbers 2,3,4,6,9. So 2 is allowed here. So cell (0,3) must be 2. Let me fill that in.\n\nSo row0, column3 is 2. Then, row0 becomes [0,3,7,2,...]. Now, let's check row0's missing numbers again. Original missing were 2,5,6. Since we filled 2 in column3, now missing are 5 and 6 for row0. Let's look at column4 (original row0 has 0 in column4). Column4 is the fifth column. Let's check existing numbers in column4:\n\nRow0: 0 (originally had 0,0 in columns 3 and 4)\nRow1: 1\nRow2: 0\nRow3:7\nRow4:0\nRow5:9\nRow6:2\nRow7:4\nRow8:0\n\nSo existing numbers in column4 are 1,7,9,2,4. Missing are 3,5,6,8. But row0's missing numbers are 5 and 6. So possible for cell (0,4) is 5 or 6. Also check the block. The block for (0,4) is top-middle (columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block now include 2 (just added at (0,3)), 8 (from row0 column5), 1 (row1 column4), 5 (row2 column3), 7 (row2 column5). So missing in block are 3,4,6,9. So possible numbers for (0,4) are 5 or 6. But column4 allows 5 and 6. Wait, but row0's missing is 5 and 6. Let me check if any constraints. Let's see if there's another cell in row0 that can be filled.\n\nLooking at row0, column0. Let's see. Possible numbers are 5 and 6. Let's check column0. Column0 has existing numbers 2 (row1), 3 (row4), 9 (row6), 7 (row7), 8 (row8). So missing in column0 are 1,4,5,6. For cell (0,0), possible numbers are 5 or 6 (since row0 needs 5 and 6). Also check the block (top-left). The block's missing numbers are 4,5,6. So possible numbers are 5,6. Hmm. How can we determine which is which?\n\nMaybe look at other cells. Let's check cell (0,4). Let's see if there's any constraints. For example, if (0,4) is 5, then (0,0) would have to be 6. Or vice versa. Maybe there's another cell in the row or column that can help.\n\nLooking at row0, column8 is 9. Column8's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:0, row2:8, row3:4, row4:5, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:6. So column8 has 9,8,4,5,6. Missing are 1,2,3,7. Not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look at the block. The top-middle block (columns3-5) has cell (0,3)=2, (0,5)=8. Let's check if any other cells in this block can be filled. For example, row1, column3 is 0. Let's see. For cell (1,3), row1's existing numbers are 2,0,8,0,1,0,0,3,0. Existing in row1: 2,8,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6,7,9. Column3 has existing 2 (now in row0), 0 (row1), 5 (row2), 3 (row3), 6 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 8 (row7), 0 (row8). So column3's existing numbers are 2,5,3,6,8. Missing are 1,4,7,9. So possible numbers for (1,3) are intersection of row1 missing (4,5,6,7,9) and column3 missing (1,4,7,9) → 4,7,9. Also check block. The block's missing numbers are 3,4,6,9 (earlier thought). Wait, after adding 2 to (0,3), the top-middle block has 2,8,1,5,7. So missing numbers are 3,4,6,9. So possible numbers for (1,3) must be in 4,7,9 (from row and column) and also in block's missing (3,4,6,9). So overlapping numbers are 4 and 9. So possible 4 or 9. Hmm, not helpful yet.\n\nLet me go back to row0. Maybe look for another cell. For example, cell (0,0) and (0,4). Let's see if there's another way. Let's check column0 for possible numbers. Column0 has existing 2,3,7,8,9. Missing are 1,4,5,6. Let's see if any of these can be placed elsewhere. For example, in row2, column0 is 0. Let's check if that can be filled. Row2 is [0,1,9,5,0,7,0,6,8]. Missing numbers in row2: existing are 1,9,5,7,6,8. Missing are 2,3,4. Column0 for row2 is missing 1,4,5,6 (but row2's missing are 2,3,4). So possible numbers for (2,0) are intersection of row missing (2,3,4) and column missing (1,4,5,6) → 4. So (2,0) must be 4. Let me check the block. The top-left block (rows0-2, columns0-2). Existing numbers include 3,7,2,8,1,9, and now adding 4. So if (2,0) is 4, that would fit. Let me confirm. Yes, because row2's missing in row is 2,3,4. Column0 missing includes 4. Block missing was 4,5,6. So adding 4 to (2,0) would be valid. So row2 becomes [4,1,9,5,0,7,0,6,8]. Now, column0 has 4 added. \n\nNow, column0's existing numbers are 2,3,4,7,8,9. Missing are 1,5,6. Let's go back to row0's (0,0). Now, possible numbers are 5 and 6 (since row0's missing is 5 and 6). Column0 now has missing 1,5,6. So possible numbers for (0,0) are 5,6. Let's check the block (top-left). The block now has 4 (row2,0), 3,7,2,8,1,9. Missing are 5,6. So yes, possible. How to determine which?\n\nLooking at row0's other cells. Let's see cell (0,4). Let's check if there's any constraints. For example, in column4. Existing numbers in column4 are 1 (row1), 7 (row3), 9 (row5), 2 (row6), 4 (row7). So missing are 3,5,6,8. Row0's missing in row is 5 and 6. So cell (0,4) can be 5 or 6. Let's check the block (top-middle). The block includes (0,3)=2, (0,4)=?, (0,5)=8; (1,3)=?, (1,4)=1, (1,5)=?; (2,3)=5, (2,4)=?, (2,5)=7. Existing numbers in the block are 2,8,1,5,7. Missing are 3,4,6,9. So for cell (0,4), possible numbers are 5 or 6. But the block's missing numbers are 3,4,6,9. So 5 is not in the block's missing. Wait, that's a problem. Because if cell (0,4) is 5, then 5 is in the block, but the block already has 5 in row2, column3. Wait, row2, column3 is 5. Yes. So 5 is already present in the block. Therefore, cell (0,4) cannot be 5. Because the block already has 5. Therefore, (0,4) must be 6. Because that's the only remaining option. \n\nSo cell (0,4) is 6. Now, row0 becomes [0,3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9]. Now, the missing in row0 is only 5. So (0,0) must be 5. Let me check column0. Column0 now has 5 added. Let's check if that's allowed. Column0 has 2,3,4,5,7,8,9. So no duplicates. And the block (top-left) now has 5 added. So yes. So row0 becomes [5,3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9].\n\nGreat, that fills row0 completely. Now, moving on. Let's look at row1: [2, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0]. Let's check what's missing in row1. Existing numbers are 2,8,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6,7,9. Let's look for cells that can be filled.\n\nLooking at column1 for row1. Column1's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:0, row2:1, row3:9, row4:7, row5:8, row6:0, row7:2, row8:4. So existing in column1 are 3,1,9,7,8,2,4. Missing are 5,6. So cell (1,1) must be 5 or 6. Let's check the block. Row1 is in the top-middle block (rows0-2, columns0-2? No, row1 is in the top-middle block? Wait, row1 is in the top-middle block for columns 3-5? Wait, no. The blocks are divided as follows: columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8. So row1, column1 is in the top-left block (columns0-2). The top-left block now has 5 (row0,0), 3,7; row1: 2, ?, 8; row2:4,1,9. Existing numbers in this block are 5,3,7,2,8,4,1,9. Missing is 6. Therefore, cell (1,1) must be 6. Because it's the only missing number in the block. \n\nSo row1 becomes [2,6,8, 0,1,0,0,3,0]. Now, check row1's missing numbers: existing are 2,6,8,1,3. Missing are 4,5,7,9. Let's look at cell (1,3), which is column3. Column3 has existing numbers: 2 (row0), 0 (row1), 5 (row2), 3 (row3), 6 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 8 (row7), 0 (row8). So column3's existing are 2,5,3,6,8. Missing are 1,4,7,9. For cell (1,3), possible numbers are row1's missing (4,5,7,9) intersect column3's missing (1,4,7,9) → 4,7,9. Also check the block. The cell (1,3) is in the top-middle block, which now has numbers 5,3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9 (from the top-left and top-middle? Wait, no. The top-middle block is columns3-5. For that block, existing numbers are:\n\nRow0: 2,6,8 (columns3-5)\nRow1: ?,1,?\nRow2:5, ?,7.\n\nSo existing numbers are 2,6,8,1,5,7. Missing are 3,4,9. Wait, but the cell (1,3) is in this block. So possible numbers are 3,4,9. But earlier intersection from row and column was 4,7,9. The intersection between those two is 4 and 9. So possible 4 or 9. \n\nLet me check if there's another constraint. For example, looking at row1's other cells. Let's check column5 (cell (1,5)). Row1's missing are 4,5,7,9. Column5's existing numbers: row0:8, row1:0, row2:7, row3:2, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:1, row8:3. Existing in column5: 8,7,2,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6,9. So for cell (1,5), possible numbers are row1's missing (4,5,7,9) and column5's missing (4,5,6,9) → 4,5,9. Also check block (top-middle). Block missing are 3,4,9. So possible numbers are 4,9. So cell (1,5) can be 4 or 9. \n\nHmm, not sure yet. Let's see if there's another cell in row1 that can be filled. For example, cell (1,6) is 0. Column6's existing numbers: row0:4, row1:0, row2:0, row3:6, row4:0, row5:3, row6:8, row7:9, row8:7. Existing in column6: 4,6,3,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,5. But row1's missing are 4,5,7,9. So intersection is 5. Therefore, cell (1,6) must be 5. Because column6 missing includes 5, and row1's missing includes 5. Let me check block. Cell (1,6) is in the top-right block (columns6-8). The block includes rows0-2, columns6-8. Existing numbers are row0:4,1,9; row1:0,3,0; row2:0,6,8. Existing numbers: 4,1,9,3,6,8. Missing are 2,5,7. So 5 is allowed here. So yes, cell (1,6) is 5. \n\nSo row1 becomes [2,6,8, 0,1,0,5,3,0]. Now, row1's missing are 4,7,9. Let's check cell (1,3) again. Possible numbers 4 or 9. Let's check column3 again. Column3's existing numbers are 2,5,3,6,8. Missing are 1,4,7,9. So cell (1,3) can be 4 or 9. Also, looking at the block (top-middle). Missing are 3,4,9. But since cell (1,3) is in the block, and existing numbers in the block are 2,6,8,1,5,7. Wait, no. The top-middle block includes columns3-5. Let me recheck existing numbers:\n\nRow0: columns3-5 are 2,6,8.\n\nRow1: columns3-5 are ?,1,? (currently 0,1,0).\n\nRow2: columns3-5 are 5, ?,7 (currently 5, 0,7).\n\nSo existing numbers are 2,6,8,1,5,7. Missing are 3,4,9. So cell (1,3) can be 3,4,9. But earlier from row and column, it's 4 or 9. So 4 or 9. \n\nLooking at cell (1,8), which is column8. Column8's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:0, row2:8, row3:4, row4:5, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:6. Existing are 9,8,4,5,6. Missing are 1,2,3,7. Row1's missing are 4,7,9. So cell (1,8) must be 7 or 9? Wait, row1's missing after adding 5 are 4,7,9. Column8's missing are 1,2,3,7. So intersection is 7. So cell (1,8) must be 7. Let me check block. The top-right block (columns6-8) has existing numbers 4,1,9,5,3,7 (from row1's new 5), and row2's 0,6,8. So adding 7 to (1,8) would be okay. So yes, cell (1,8) is 7. Now, row1 becomes [2,6,8, 0,1,0,5,3,7]. Now, row1's missing are 4 and 9. \n\nNow, looking at cell (1,5) (column5). Row1's missing are 4 and 9. Column5's existing numbers are 8,7,2,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6,9. So possible numbers are 4 and 9. Also check block (top-middle). Missing are 3,4,9. So possible 4 or 9. Let me see if there's another constraint. For example, looking at column5 for row1. If cell (1,5) is 4 or 9. Let's check other cells in column5. For example, row4, column5 is 0. But maybe not helpful. Let's look at the block. The top-middle block's missing are 3,4,9. Since cell (1,3) is part of that block and can be 4 or 9, and cell (1,5) is also part of that block and can be 4 or 9. Let's see if there's a way to determine which.\n\nLooking at row1's cell (1,3). If cell (1,3) is 4, then cell (1,5) must be 9. If cell (1,3) is 9, then cell (1,5) must be 4. Let's check column3 for cell (1,3). Column3's existing numbers are 2,5,3,6,8. If cell (1,3) is 4, then column3 would have 4 added. If it's 9, column3 would have 9 added. Let me check if there's a conflict elsewhere. For example, looking at row4, column3 is 6. Let me think if there's another cell in column3 that can help. \n\nAlternatively, maybe look at row1's cell (1,3) and see if there are any other constraints. Let's check row1's cell (1,3). Possible numbers are 4 and 9. Let's check the block. If the block needs 3,4,9. Suppose cell (1,3) is 4. Then the remaining missing in the block would be 3 and 9. Where could they be? For example, in row1, column5 (cell (1,5)) would be 9, and maybe another cell. Alternatively, if cell (1,3) is 9, then cell (1,5) is 4, and then the missing would be 3. \n\nBut how to decide? Let me check other cells. For example, cell (1,5) is column5. Let's look at row5, column5. Row5 is [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0]. Column5 has existing numbers 8,7,2,1,3. Let me see if there's a cell in column5 that can be filled. But maybe not helpful. Let me try another approach. Let's check cell (1,3). If it's 4, then row1's missing numbers would be 9 (since we already have 4 filled in (1,3) and 9 in (1,5)). Let me check if there's any conflict. \n\nAlternatively, let's look at row2. Row2 is [4,1,9,5,0,7,0,6,8]. Missing numbers are 2,3. Because existing are 4,1,9,5,7,6,8. Missing are 2,3. Let's look at cell (2,4) (column4). Column4's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:1, row2:0, row3:7, row4:0, row5:9, row6:2, row7:4, row8:0. Existing are 6,1,7,9,2,4. Missing are 3,5,8. Wait, row2's missing are 2 and 3. For cell (2,4), possible numbers are 2 or 3. But column4's missing includes 3. So possible 3. Because 2 is already in column4 (row6:2). Wait, column4 has 2 in row6. So cell (2,4) can't be 2. Therefore, cell (2,4) must be 3. Let me check. Yes! Because column4 has 2, so 2 is already present. So cell (2,4) is 3. Now, row2 becomes [4,1,9,5,3,7,0,6,8]. Now, row2's missing is 2. So cell (2,6) must be 2. \n\nSo cell (2,6) is 2. Now, row2 is [4,1,9,5,3,7,2,6,8]. \n\nNow, let's go back to row1. Now, the top-middle block has cell (2,4) as 3. So the block's missing numbers were 3,4,9. Now that 3 is added, the remaining missing are 4 and 9. So cell (1,3) and (1,5) must be 4 and 9. Let's see. \n\nLooking at cell (1,3). Column3's existing numbers are 2,5,3,6,8. Adding 4 or 9. Let me check if there's a conflict. For example, if cell (1,3) is 4, then column3 has 4 added. If cell (1,3) is 9, then column3 has 9 added. Let me check if there are any other constraints. \n\nLooking at row1's cell (1,5). If cell (1,5) is 9, then column5 would have 9 added. Let me check column5's existing numbers: 8,7,2,1,3, and row5's column5 is 0. So adding 9 there would be okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe look at the block for cell (1,5). It's in the top-middle block. Since the block now needs 4 and 9. Let me check if there's another cell in the block that can help. The block's remaining missing are 4 and 9. The other cell is row1, column5. So if cell (1,3) is 4, then cell (1,5) is 9. If cell (1,3) is 9, then cell (1,5) is 4. \n\nLet me check row1's column5. If cell (1,5) is 4, then row1's missing numbers would be 9. If it's 9, then row1's missing would be 4. How can we determine which? Let's look at column5. Column5's existing numbers are 8,7,2,1,3, and possibly 9 or 4. Let me check row5, column5. Row5 is [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0]. Column5 for row5 is 0. Let's see what's missing in row5. Existing in row5: 8,4,9,3. Missing are 1,2,5,6,7. Wait, no, row5 is [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0]. So existing numbers are 8,4,9,3. Missing are 1,2,5,6,7. \n\nBut maybe not helpful. Let me look at column5 again. Column5 has existing numbers: row0:8, row1: ?, row2:7, row3:2, row4: ?, row5: ?, row6: ?, row7:1, row8:3. Existing are 8,7,2,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6,9. \n\nIf cell (1,5) is 4, then column5 has 4 added. If it's 9, then column5 has 9 added. Let me check if there's another cell in column5 that could be affected. For example, looking at row4, column5. Row4 is [3,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]. Let's see what's missing in row4. Existing numbers: 3,7,6,5. Missing are 1,2,4,8,9. Column5 for row4 is 0. Possible numbers are from row4's missing and column5's missing (4,5,6,9). So intersection is 4,9. So cell (4,5) could be 4 or 9. \n\nBut this seems similar to our current problem. Maybe we need to find another way. Let's look back at row1's cell (1,3). If cell (1,3) is 4, then cell (1,5) is 9. Let me check if that leads to any contradictions. \n\nIf cell (1,3) is 4, then row1 becomes [2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7]. Let's check if this is valid. Row1 has 2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Column3 would have 4 added, which is okay. Column5 would have 9 added, which is okay. Block top-middle would have 4 and 9 added. Yes, that seems valid. \n\nAlternatively, if cell (1,3) is 9, then cell (1,5) is 4. Row1 becomes [2,6,8,9,1,4,5,3,7]. Check row: numbers are 2,6,8,9,1,4,5,3,7. Valid. Column3 would have 9 added, column5 has 4 added. Also valid. \n\nSo both possibilities are valid. How to choose? Let's look for another cell that depends on this. For example, cell (1,3) being 4 or 9 might affect other cells. Let's check row1's cell (1,8) is already 7, so no problem. Let's see if there's another cell in the same block or column that can help. \n\nLooking at column3 for cell (1,3). If it's 4, then column3 has 4. If it's 9, column3 has 9. Let's see if there are other cells in column3 that can be filled. For example, row5, column3 is 0. Let me check if there's a way to determine what's there. \n\nRow5 is [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0]. Let's look at column3 for row5. Column3's existing numbers are 2,4 (if we added it), 5,3,6,8,9 (if added). So if cell (1,3) is 4, then column3 has 4. So for row5, column3, possible numbers would be missing from column3. Let me think this through. \n\nBut this might be getting too complicated. Maybe we need to make an assumption and see if it leads to a contradiction. Let's try cell (1,3)=4 first. \n\nAssume cell (1,3)=4. Then row1 becomes [2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7]. Now, let's proceed. \n\nNow, column3 has 4 added. Let's look at other cells in column3. For example, row5, column3 is 0. Let's check what can go there. \n\nRow5: [0,8,4,0,9,0,3,0,0]. Missing in row5 are 1,2,5,6,7. Column3's existing numbers are 2,4,5,3,6,8,9. Missing are 1,7. So cell (5,3) can be 1 or 7. Also check the block. Row5 is in the middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). Let me check existing numbers in that block. \n\nColumns3-5 for rows3-5:\n\nRow3:3,7,2\n\nRow4:6, ?, ?\n\nRow5: ?,9, ?\n\nExisting numbers are 3,7,2,6,9. Missing are 1,4,5,8. But cell (5,3) is in this block. Possible numbers are 1 or 7 from column and row. But block's missing include 1. So cell (5,3) can be 1. \n\nSo let's assume cell (5,3) is 1. Then row5 becomes [0,8,4,1,9,0,3,0,0]. Now, check row5's missing numbers: existing are 8,4,1,9,3. Missing are 2,5,6,7. \n\nNow, column3 for row5 is 1. Let's look at cell (5,5), which is column5. Column5's existing numbers include 8 (row0), 9 (row1),7 (row2),2 (row3), and now possibly others. Let me check column5 again. Existing numbers are 8,9,7,2,1 (if cell (5,5) is filled?), but currently, cell (5,5) is 0. \n\nBut maybe this isn't helping. Let's try to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another cell that can be filled. Let's look at row3: [0,9,5,3,7,2,6,0,4]. Missing numbers in row3 are 1,8. Because existing are 9,5,3,7,2,6,4. Missing are 1,8. Let's check column0 for row3 (cell (3,0)). Column0's existing numbers are 5 (row0), 2 (row1),4 (row2),0 (row3),3 (row4),0 (row5),9 (row6),7 (row7),8 (row8). So existing in column0 are 5,2,4,3,9,7,8. Missing are 1,6. But row3's missing are 1,8. So possible numbers for (3,0) are 1. Because column0 missing includes 1. So cell (3,0) must be 1. \n\nSo row3 becomes [1,9,5,3,7,2,6,0,4]. Now, row3's missing is 8. So cell (3,7) must be 8. \n\nNow, row3 is [1,9,5,3,7,2,6,8,4]. \n\nNow, column7 for cell (3,7) is 8. Let's check if that affects other cells. For example, row1's column7 is 3, which is okay. \n\nNow, let's go back to row5. Now that row3's column7 is 8, let's check other cells. \n\nRow5 is [0,8,4,1,9,0,3,0,0]. Missing are 2,5,6,7. Let's look at column0 for row5. Column0's existing numbers are 5,2,4,1 (row3),3,9,7,8. Missing is 6. So cell (5,0) must be 6. \n\nSo row5 becomes [6,8,4,1,9,0,3,0,0]. Now, row5's missing are 2,5,7. \n\nNow, column5 for row5 is 0. Let's check what's possible. Column5's existing numbers are 8 (row0),9 (row1),7 (row2),2 (row3), and others? Let me recheck column5:\n\nRow0:8\nRow1:9\nRow2:7\nRow3:2\nRow4:?\nRow5:?\nRow6:?\nRow7:1\nRow8:3\n\nExisting are 8,9,7,2,1,3. Missing are 4,5,6. But row5's column5 is missing in row5's numbers: 2,5,7. Wait, column5 for row5 is cell (5,5). Possible numbers must be in row5's missing (2,5,7) and column5's missing (4,5,6). Intersection is 5. So cell (5,5) must be 5. \n\nSo row5 becomes [6,8,4,1,9,5,3,0,0]. Now, row5's missing are 2 and 7. \n\nNow, column7 and 8 for row5 are 0. Let's check column7. Column7's existing numbers are row0:1, row1:3, row2:6, row3:8, row4:0, row5:0, row6:4, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 1,3,6,8,4,2. Missing are 5,7,9. Row5's missing in row are 2,7. Wait, row5's current missing are 2 and 7. For cell (5,7), possible numbers are 2 or 7. Column7's missing are 5,7,9. So intersection is 7. So cell (5,7) must be 7. \n\nThen, row5 becomes [6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7,0]. Now, missing in row5 is 2. So cell (5,8) must be 2. \n\nNow, row5 is [6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7,2]. \n\nNow, column8 for cell (5,8) is 2. Let's check if that's okay. Column8 has existing numbers: row0:9, row1:7, row2:8, row3:4, row4:5, row5:2, row6:0, row7:0, row8:6. So no duplicates. \n\nNow, moving on. Let's check row4: [3,7,0,6,0,0,0,0,5]. Existing numbers are 3,7,6,5. Missing are 1,2,4,8,9. Let's look for cells to fill. \n\nLooking at column2 for row4. Cell (4,2) is 0. Column2's existing numbers: row0:7, row1:8, row2:9, row3:5, row4:0, row5:4, row6:3, row7:0, row8:1. Existing are 7,8,9,5,4,3,1. Missing are 2,6. But row4's missing are 1,2,4,8,9. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (4,2) must be 2. \n\nSo row4 becomes [3,7,2,6,0,0,0,0,5]. Now, row4's missing are 1,4,8,9. \n\nLet's look at cell (4,4) (column4). Column4's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:1, row2:3, row3:7, row4:0, row5:9, row6:2, row7:4, row8:0. Existing are 6,1,3,7,9,2,4. Missing are 5,8. But row4's missing are 1,4,8,9. So possible for cell (4,4) is 8. Because column4 missing is 5,8. But row4's missing includes 8. So cell (4,4) must be 8. \n\nSo row4 becomes [3,7,2,6,8,0,0,0,5]. Now, row4's missing are 1,4,9. \n\nNow, looking at cell (4,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers are 8,9,7,2,1,3,5. Missing are 4,6. But row4's missing are 1,4,9. So possible numbers for cell (4,5) are 4. Because intersection is 4. \n\nSo cell (4,5) is 4. Now, row4 becomes [3,7,2,6,8,4,0,0,5]. Missing are 1,9. \n\nNow, looking at columns6 and 7 for row4. Let's check cell (4,6) (column6). Column6's existing numbers: row0:4, row1:5, row2:2, row3:6, row4:0, row5:3, row6:8, row7:9, row8:7. Existing are 4,5,2,6,3,8,9,7. Missing is 1. So cell (4,6) must be 1. \n\nSo row4 becomes [3,7,2,6,8,4,1,0,5]. Now, missing in row4 is 9 in cell (4,7). \n\nSo cell (4,7) is 9. Now, row4 is [3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9,5]. \n\nNow, column7 for cell (4,7) is 9. Let's check if that affects other cells. \n\nNow, let's look at row7: [7,2,0,8,4,1,9,0,0]. Missing numbers are 3,5,6. Existing are 7,2,8,4,1,9. \n\nLet's check cell (7,2). Column2's existing numbers are 7,8,9,5,2,4,3,1. Missing are 6. Because column2 has 7 (row0), 8 (row1), 9 (row2), 5 (row3), 2 (row4), 4 (row5), 3 (row6), 1 (row8). So cell (7,2) must be 6. \n\nSo row7 becomes [7,2,6,8,4,1,9,0,0]. Now, row7's missing are 3,5. \n\nLooking at cell (7,7) and (7,8). Column7's existing numbers are 1 (row0),3 (row1),6 (row2),8 (row3),9 (row4),7 (row5),4 (row6),0 (row7),2 (row8). Existing are 1,3,6,8,9,7,4,2. Missing are 5. But row7's missing are 3,5. Wait, cell (7,7) is column7. Column7's existing numbers are 1,3,6,8,9,7,4,2. So missing is 5. Therefore, cell (7,7) must be 5. \n\nThen, row7 becomes [7,2,6,8,4,1,9,5,0]. Now, missing in row7 is 3 in cell (7,8). \n\nSo cell (7,8) is 3. Now, row7 is [7,2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3]. \n\nNow, column8 for cell (7,8) is 3. Let's check column8's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:7, row2:8, row3:4, row4:5, row5:2, row6:0, row7:3, row8:6. Missing are 1. \n\nNow, let's check row6: [9, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 8, 4, 0]. Let's fill in what we can. \n\nRow6 is [9, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 8, 4, 0]. Missing numbers are 1,5,6,7. \n\nLet's check cell (6,1). Column1's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:6, row2:1, row3:9, row4:7, row5:8, row6:0, row7:2, row8:4. Existing are 3,6,1,9,7,8,2,4. Missing is 5. So cell (6,1) must be 5. \n\nSo row6 becomes [9,5,3,0,2,0,8,4,0]. Now, missing are 1,6,7. \n\nLooking at cell (6,3) (column3). Column3's existing numbers are 2 (row0),4 (row1),5 (row2),3 (row3),6 (row4),1 (row5),0 (row6),8 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 2,4,5,3,6,1,8. Missing are 7,9. But row6's missing are 1,6,7. So possible for cell (6,3) is 7. \n\nLet me check. Column3's missing are 7 and 9. But row6's missing includes 7. So cell (6,3) must be 7. \n\nSo row6 becomes [9,5,3,7,2,0,8,4,0]. Now, missing are 1 and 6. \n\nNow, cell (6,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers are 8,9,7,2,4,5,1,3. Missing are 6. Because column5 has 8,9,7,2,4,5,1,3. So cell (6,5) must be 6. \n\nSo row6 becomes [9,5,3,7,2,6,8,4,0]. Now, missing in row6 is 1 in cell (6,8). \n\nSo cell (6,8) is 1. Now, row6 is [9,5,3,7,2,6,8,4,1]. \n\nNow, column8 for cell (6,8) is 1. Let's check if that's okay. Column8's existing numbers are 9,7,8,4,5,2,3,6,1. All filled except row8's column8 is 6. Wait, row8's column8 is 6, which is okay. \n\nNow, let's look at row8: [8,4,1,0,0,3,7,2,6]. Missing numbers are 5,9. \n\nLooking at cell (8,3) and (8,4). Let's check column3 for cell (8,3). Column3's existing numbers are 2,4,5,3,6,1,7,8. Missing is 9. So cell (8,3) must be 9. \n\nSo row8 becomes [8,4,1,9,0,3,7,2,6]. Now, missing in row8 is 5 in cell (8,4). \n\nSo cell (8,4) is 5. Now, row8 is [8,4,1,9,5,3,7,2,6]. \n\nNow, check column4 for cell (8,4)=5. Column4's existing numbers are 6 (row0),1 (row1),3 (row2),7 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),2 (row6),4 (row7),5 (row8). All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good. \n\nNow, let's check row7's cell (7,2) is filled as 6, and other cells. \n\nNow, the only remaining cell is row6's cell (6,8) which is filled. Let me check if there are any remaining zeros. \n\nLooking at the current board:\n\nRow0: [5,3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9] – filled\nRow1: [2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7] – filled\nRow2: [4,1,9,5,3,7,2,6,8] – filled\nRow3: [1,9,5,3,7,2,6,8,4] – filled\nRow4: [3,7,2,6,8,4,1,9,5] – filled\nRow5: [6,8,4,1,9,5,3,7,2] – filled\nRow6: [9,5,3,7,2,6,8,4,1] – filled\nRow7: [7,2,6,8,4,1,9,5,3] – filled\nRow8: [8,4,1,9,5,3,7,2,6] – filled\n\nAll rows are filled with no zeros. Let me verify each row, column, and block for validity.\n\nCheck rows: all have 1-9 no duplicates. \n\nCheck columns:\n\nColumn0: 5,2,4,1,3,6,9,7,8 → 1-9\nColumn1: 3,6,1,9,7,8,5,2,4 → 1-9\nColumn2:7,8,9,5,2,4,3,6,1 → 1-9\nColumn3:2,4,5,3,6,1,7,8,9 → 1-9\nColumn4:6,1,3,7,8,9,2,4,5 → 1-9\nColumn5:8,9,7,2,4,5,6,1,3 → 1-9\nColumn6:4,5,2,6,1,3,8,9,7 → 1-9\nColumn7:1,3,6,8,9,7,4,5,2 → 1-9\nColumn8:9,7,8,4,5,2,1,3,6 → 1-9\n\nAll columns are valid.\n\nCheck blocks:\n\nTop-left (rows0-2, cols0-2):\n5,3,7\n2,6,8\n4,1,9 → all 1-9\n\nTop-middle (rows0-2, cols3-5):\n2,6,8\n4,1,9\n5,3,7 → all 1-9\n\nTop-right (rows0-2, cols6-8):\n4,1,9\n5,3,7\n2,6,8 → all 1-9\n\nMiddle-left (rows3-5, cols0-2):\n1,9,5\n3,7,2\n6,8,4 → all 1-9\n\nMiddle-middle (rows3-5, cols3-5):\n3,7,2\n6,8,4\n1,9,5 → all 1-9\n\nMiddle-right (rows3-5, cols6-8):\n6,8,4\n1,9,5\n3,7,2 → all 1-9\n\nBottom-left (rows6-8, cols0-2):\n9,5,3\n7,2,6\n8,4,1 → all 1-9\n\nBottom-middle (rows6-8, cols3-5):\n7,2,6\n8,4,1\n9,5,3 → all 1-9\n\nBottom-right (rows6-8, cols6-8):\n8,4,1\n9,5,3\n7,2,6 → all 1-9\n\nAll blocks are valid. So the solution is correct.\n ;Answer: [[5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9], [2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 3, 7], [4, 1, 9, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8], [1, 9, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8, 4], [3, 7, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5], [6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 3, 7, 2], [9, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1], [7, 2, 6, 8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 3], [8, 4, 1, 9, 5, 3, 7, 2, 6]]"

      "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this Sudoku puzzle. The board is given with some zeros, which are the empty cells. The rules are that each row, column, and 3x3 block must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition. Alright, let's start by looking for cells that can only have one possible number.\n\nLooking at the first row: [1, 0, 3, 0, 8, 6, 0, 0, 7]. Let's check each empty cell. The second cell (row 0, column 1) is missing. The existing numbers in the row are 1,3,8,6,7. So possible numbers are 2,4,5,9. Now check column 1. Column 1 has 0 (from first row), 2 (second row), 0 (third), 7 (fourth), 0 (fifth), 6 (sixth), 1 (seventh), 4 (eighth), 0 (ninth). So existing numbers in column 1 are 2,7,6,1,4. So the missing in column 1 for row 0 are 3,5,8,9? Wait, no. Wait, the column 1 has existing numbers: row 0 is 0, row 1 is 2, row 2 is 0, row 3 is 7, row 4 is 0, row 5 is 6, row 6 is 1, row 7 is 4, row 8 is 0. So existing numbers are 2,7,6,1,4. So possible numbers for row 0, column 1 are 3,5,8,9? Wait, but the row already has 1,3, etc. Wait, the row 0 has 1,3,8,6,7. So the missing numbers for the row are 2,4,5,9. So for column 1, possible numbers are 2,4,5,9? Wait, no. Wait, the column's existing numbers are 2,7,6,1,4. So numbers not present in column 1 are 3,5,8,9. But the row's missing numbers are 2,4,5,9. The intersection of these is 5 and 9. So the cell (0,1) could be 5 or 9. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's look for easier cells.\n\nMaybe looking at the 3x3 blocks. Let's take the first block (top-left). Rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Current numbers: row 0: 1, 0, 3; row 1: 9,2,7; row 2:4,0,0. So existing numbers are 1,3,9,2,7,4. Missing are 5,6,8. Let's check the cells in this block. The row 0, column 1 is part of this block. The possible numbers for that cell are 5,6,8? Wait, earlier analysis said 5 or 9, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck. The column 1 has existing numbers as 2,7,6,1,4. So possible numbers for column 1 are 3,5,8,9. But the row's missing numbers are 2,4,5,9. So the intersection is 5 and 9. But the block's missing numbers are 5,6,8. So the cell (0,1) can't be 6 or 8? Wait, because the block needs 5,6,8. But the cell's possible numbers from row and column are 5 and 9. But 9 is already in the block (row 1, column 0). So 9 is already present in the block, so it can't be in this cell. Therefore, the cell (0,1) must be 5. Because 5 is in the row's missing, column's possible, and block's missing. Let me confirm:\n\nYes. So cell (0,1) is 5. Let's put that in.\n\nNow row 0 becomes [1,5,3, ...]. Let's check if that's valid. The row now has 1,5,3, which are unique. Column 1 now has 5 in row 0. The block now has 5 added, so missing are 6 and 8 in the block.\n\nNext, looking at the same block. The cell (2,1) and (2,2). Let's check. The block's missing numbers are 6 and 8. Let's look at row 2: [4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0]. The first three cells are 4, ?, ?. The block's missing are 6 and 8. Let's check column 1 and 2 for these cells.\n\nFor cell (2,1): column 1. Existing numbers in column 1 are now 5 (row 0), 2 (row1), 0 (row2), 7 (row3), 0 (row4), 6 (row5), 1 (row6), 4 (row7), 0 (row8). So possible numbers for column 1 are 3,8,9? Wait, existing numbers are 5,2,7,6,1,4. So missing in column 1 are 3,8,9. But the block's missing are 6 and 8. Wait, but the cell (2,1) is in the block that needs 6 and 8. So possible numbers for cell (2,1) are 6 and 8? But column 1 allows 3,8,9. So intersection is 8. Therefore, cell (2,1) must be 8. Let's put that in.\n\nNow, row 2 becomes [4, 8, ?, ...]. Now the block's missing is 6 for the remaining cell in the block. The remaining cell in the block is (2,2). So that must be 6. Let me check. The block's existing numbers are 1,5,3; 9,2,7; 4,8,6. All unique. Yes. So cell (2,2) is 6. Now row 2 is [4,8,6,9,...].\n\nOkay, moving on. Let's check other cells. Let's look at row 0 again: [1,5,3, 0,8,6, 0, 0,7]. The missing numbers in the row are 2,4,9. The fourth cell (column 3) is 0. Let's check column 3. Column 3 has: row0:0; row1:1; row2:9; row3:5; row4:8; row5:2; row6:3; row7:0; row8:0. Existing numbers in column 3 are 1,9,5,8,2,3. Missing are 4,6,7. The row's missing numbers are 2,4,9. The intersection is 4. So cell (0,3) must be 4. Let's fill that in. Now row0 becomes [1,5,3,4,8,6, ...].\n\nNow the row's missing numbers are 2 and 9. The next empty cells in row 0 are positions 6,7. Let's look at cell (0,6). Column 6 has: row0:0; row1:4; row2:1; row3:0; row4:0; row5:5; row6:0; row7:7; row8:0. Existing numbers are 4,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,6,8,9. The row's missing are 2 and 9. So possible for cell (0,6) are 2 or 9. Also, check the 3x3 block for cell (0,6). This is the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Let's look at existing numbers in that block. Row0 has 0,0,7. Row1: 4, 0,6. Row2:1,5,0. Existing numbers in the block: 4,6,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,8,9. So possible for cell (0,6) is 2 or 9. Let's see if there's a way to determine which. Let's check other cells in the same block.\n\nLooking at row0, column7 (cell 0,7). It's also in this block. Let's see if we can find any constraints. Maybe look for other cells in the block. For example, row2, column8 (cell 2,8) is 0. The column 8 has existing numbers: row0:7; row1:6; row2:0; row3:0; row4:0; row5:4; row6:2; row7:0; row8:8. Existing numbers in column 8: 7,6,4,2,8. Missing are 1,3,5,9. But for the block, cell (2,8) is in the block's missing (2,3,8,9). Wait, the block's missing are 2,3,8,9. But column 8 for cell (2,8) can't have 8 because row2's column8 is already 0 and column 8 has 8 in row8. So cell (2,8) can't be 8. So possible for cell (2,8) are 2,3,9. Not sure yet.\n\nBack to cell (0,6). Let's check if there's another way. Maybe look at the row's missing numbers. The row is missing 2 and 9. Let's check column 6 for possible numbers. Column 6's existing numbers are 4,1,5,7. So possible for cell (0,6) are 2,3,6,8,9. But row's missing are 2 and 9. So it's 2 or 9. Let's check if there's another constraint. For example, if in the block, there's another cell that can only take one value.\n\nLooking at cell (1,7) in row1, column7. The row is [9,2,7,1,5,0,4,0,6]. The missing in row1 is the sixth column (column5) and column7. Let's check column5 for row1. Column5 has existing numbers: row0:6; row1:0; row2:0; row3:4; row4:9; row5:1; row6:8; row7:2; row8:5. Existing numbers are 6,4,9,1,8,2,5. Missing are 3 and 7. But row1's column5 is in row1 which has numbers 9,2,7,1,5, etc. The existing numbers in row1 are 9,2,7,1,5,4,6. Missing are 3,8. Wait, row1's current numbers are [9,2,7,1,5, ?, 4, ?, 6]. So missing numbers are 3, 8. So column5's missing are 3 and 7. Therefore, cell (1,5) must be 3 or 7. But row's missing are 3 and 8. So intersection is 3. Therefore, cell (1,5) is 3. Let me check that. Yes, because column5 allows 3 and 7, but row allows 3 and 8. So only 3 is common. So cell (1,5) is 3. Now row1 becomes [9,2,7,1,5,3,4,0,6]. Now, the missing in row1 is column7 (which is 0). The row's missing number is 8. So cell (1,7) must be 8. Let's put that in. Now row1 is [9,2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6]. Now check column7. Column7 now has 8 in row1. Let's check if that helps with cell (0,7).\n\nBack to row0's cell (0,7). The row0 is missing 2 and 9 in the row. Column7's existing numbers are 8 (row1), 5 (row2?), let me check column7 again. Column7 has row0:0; row1:8; row2:5; row3:6; row4:7; row5:0; row6:0; row7:1; row8:4. So existing numbers are 8,5,6,7,1,4. Missing are 2,3,9. The row's missing are 2 and 9. So possible for cell (0,7) is 2 or 9. Also, the block (top-middle) has existing numbers: row0's column6-8 are 0, 0,7; row1:4,8,6; row2:1,5,0. Existing numbers in the block are 4,8,6,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,9. So cell (0,7) can be 2,3,9. But row says 2 or 9, so possible 2 or 9. How to decide?\n\nLet me look at cell (0,6), which is column6. Column6 has existing numbers: row0:0; row1:4; row2:1; row3:0; row4:0; row5:5; row6:0; row7:7; row8:0. Existing numbers are 4,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,6,8,9. For cell (0,6), which is in row0, column6. The row's missing are 2 and 9. So possible 2 or 9. Also, block's missing are 2,3,9. So same as before. Maybe check other cells in the block. For example, cell (2,8) is in the same block. Let me check if there's any constraints there.\n\nRow2 is [4,8,6,9,0,0,1,5,0]. The missing in row2 are the fifth, sixth columns (columns4 and 5) and column8. Let's check column4. Column4 has existing numbers: row0:8; row1:5; row2:0; row3:3; row4:0; row5:7; row6:4; row7:9; row8:0. Existing numbers are 8,5,3,7,4,9. Missing are 1,2,6. Wait, row2's column4 is 0. The row's existing numbers are 4,8,6,9,1,5. Missing are 2,3,7. Wait, row2 is [4,8,6,9, 0, 0, 1,5, 0]. So existing numbers are 4,8,6,9,1,5. Missing are 2,3,7. Column4's missing numbers are 1,2,6? Wait, column4 has 8 (row0), 5 (row1), 0 (row2), 3 (row3), 0 (row4), 7 (row5), 4 (row6), 9 (row7), 0 (row8). So existing numbers are 8,5,3,7,4,9. Missing are 1, 2, 6. So for cell (2,4), possible numbers are 1,2,6. But row's missing are 2,3,7. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (2,4) must be 2. Let's fill that in. Now row2 becomes [4,8,6,9,2, 0, 1,5, 0]. Now, the missing in row2 is column5 and column8. Let's check column5 for cell (2,5). Column5 has existing numbers: row0:6; row1:3; row2:0; row3:4; row4:9; row5:1; row6:8; row7:2; row8:5. Existing numbers are 6,3,4,9,1,8,2,5. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (2,5) must be 7. Let's put that in. Now row2 is [4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5, 0]. Now, the missing in row2 is column8. The row's missing number is 3. Because existing numbers are 4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5. Missing is 3. So cell (2,8) must be 3. Let's check column8. Column8 has row0:7; row1:6; row2:3; row3:0; row4:0; row5:4; row6:2; row7:0; row8:8. So adding 3 here is valid. Now row2 becomes [4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5,3]. \n\nNow, back to the top-middle block. The block now has cell (2,8)=3. The missing in the block are 2 and 9. Because existing numbers are 1,5,3,4,8,6, etc. Let me recheck. The block includes rows 0-2, columns 6-8. Current values:\n\nRow0: [0, 0, 7]\n\nRow1: [4, 8, 6]\n\nRow2: [1, 5, 3]\n\nSo existing numbers in the block are 4,8,6,1,5,3,7. Missing are 2,9. Therefore, cells (0,6) and (0,7) must be 2 and 9. \n\nNow, for cell (0,6) and (0,7). Let's see if we can find which is which. \n\nLooking at column6 for cell (0,6): existing numbers are 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 5 (row5), 7 (row7). So missing are 2,3,6,8,9. But the block says it's 2 or 9. So cell (0,6) can be 2 or 9. Similarly, cell (0,7) is in column7 which has existing numbers 8 (row1), 5 (row2?), let me check column7 again. Column7 has row0:0; row1:8; row2:5; row3:6; row4:7; row5:0; row6:0; row7:1; row8:4. Existing numbers are 8,5,6,7,1,4. Missing are 2,3,9. So for cell (0,7), possible numbers are 2,9 (since row0's missing are 2 and 9). \n\nSo how to decide between 2 and 9 for these two cells? Let's look at other cells in the same row or column.\n\nLooking at row0, the remaining missing numbers are 2 and 9. The cells are (0,6) and (0,7). Let's check column for each.\n\nFor cell (0,6): column6. If we put 2 here, then cell (0,7) would be 9. Let's see if that's possible. Alternatively, if cell (0,6) is 9, then cell (0,7) is 2. Let's check for conflicts.\n\nLet me look at column6. If cell (0,6) is 2, then column6 would have 2 added. Is there any conflict? No. Similarly, if it's 9. Let's see if there's another constraint. For example, looking at row0's column6's 3x3 block (which is the same as before). The block needs 2 and 9. So both possibilities are allowed. Maybe check other cells in the same column or row.\n\nAlternatively, look at row0's column7. If cell (0,7) is 9, then column7 would have 9 added. But column7's existing numbers don't have 9 yet. Is that allowed? Yes. But maybe there's another cell in column7 that can help. For example, row5, column7 is 0. Let's check row5: [0,6,9,2,7,1,5,0,4]. The missing numbers in row5 are the first and seventh columns (columns0 and 7). Let's check column0 for row5. Column0 has: row0:1; row1:9; row2:4; row3:2; row4:5; row5:0; row6:0; row7:0; row8:6. Existing numbers are 1,9,4,2,5,6. Missing are 3,7,8. Row5's missing numbers are column0 and column7. The row's existing numbers are 6,9,2,7,1,5,4. Missing are 3,8. So for cell (5,0), possible numbers are 3,8. And for cell (5,7), possible numbers are same. Let's check column7 for cell (5,7). Column7's missing are 2,3,9. So if cell (0,7) is 9, then column7 would have 9, which would mean cell (5,7) can't be 9. But cell (5,7) is part of row5's missing (3 or 8). So no conflict. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's check the block for cell (0,7). It's in the top-middle block. If cell (0,7) is 9, then the block's missing would be satisfied. Let me think if there are any other constraints. Maybe looking at row0's column6. Let's check if there's another cell in column6 that can help. For example, row3, column6 is 0. Let's look at row3: [2,7,1,5,3,4,0,6,0]. Missing numbers in row3 are columns6 and 8. Let's check column6 for row3. Column6's existing numbers are 0 (row0), 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 0 (row3), 0 (row4), 5 (row5), 0 (row6), 7 (row7), 0 (row8). So possible numbers for cell (3,6) are 2,3,6,8,9. But row3's missing numbers are in columns6 and 8. The row has existing numbers 2,7,1,5,3,4,6. Missing are 8,9. So cell (3,6) must be 8 or 9. Let's see if there's a way to determine. \n\nIf cell (0,6) is 2, then in column6, cell (0,6)=2. Then cell (3,6) could be 8 or 9. If cell (0,6) is 9, then cell (3,6) can't be 9, so must be 8. Let's see if there's a way to figure this out. Maybe looking at the block for cell (3,6). It's in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2?), no. Wait, cell (3,6) is in row3, column6. The 3x3 block for that is rows 3-5, columns 6-8. Let me check the existing numbers in that block. \n\nRow3: columns6-8 are [0,6,0]. Row4: columns6-8 are [0,7,0]. Row5: columns6-8 are [5, 0,4]. Existing numbers in this block are 6,5,7,4. Missing are 1,2,3,8,9. But row3's cell (3,6) is part of this block. Not sure yet. Maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to assume cell (0,6) is 2 and see if it leads to a contradiction. Let's tentatively put 2 in (0,6). Then cell (0,7) would be 9. Let's check if that's possible. \n\nRow0 becomes [1,5,3,4,8,6,2,9,7]. Let's check if this is valid. The row has 1,5,3,4,8,6,2,9,7. All unique. Column6 now has 2 added. Column7 now has 9 added. Let's check column7: existing numbers are 8,5,6,7,1,4,9. Are there duplicates? No. Now, check the block for top-middle. The block has 2 and 9 added. All good.\n\nNow, proceeding with this assumption. Let's see if other cells can be filled.\n\nNow, row0 is complete. Let's move to row3: [2,7,1,5,3,4,0,6,0]. Missing numbers are columns6 and 8. The row's existing numbers are 2,7,1,5,3,4,6. Missing are 8,9. So cell (3,6) and (3,8) must be 8 and 9. Let's check column6 for cell (3,6). Column6 has existing numbers: 2 (row0), 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 0 (row3), ... Let's check column6's existing numbers. Column6 now has 2 (row0), 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 0 (row3), 0 (row4), 5 (row5), 0 (row6), 7 (row7), 0 (row8). So existing numbers are 2,4,1,5,7. Missing are 3,6,8,9. But for cell (3,6), possible numbers are 8 or 9 (from row's missing). So possible. Let's check the block for cell (3,6). The block is rows3-5, columns6-8. Existing numbers in this block are row3's 0,6,0; row4's 0,7,0; row5's 5,0,4. Existing numbers are 6,7,5,4. Missing are 1,2,3,8,9. So possible for cell (3,6) is 8 or 9. Let's check column8 for cell (3,8). Column8 has existing numbers: 7 (row0), 6 (row1), 3 (row2), 0 (row3), 0 (row4), 4 (row5), 2 (row6), 0 (row7), 8 (row8). Missing are 1,5,9. Wait, row3's cell (3,8) is in column8. The row's missing numbers are 8 and 9. But column8's missing are 1,5,9? Wait, existing numbers in column8 are 7,6,3,4,2,8. Missing are 1,5,9. So for cell (3,8), possible numbers are 9 (since row's missing are 8 and 9, but column8 allows 9). Therefore, cell (3,8) must be 9. Then cell (3,6) must be 8. Let's fill those in. Now row3 becomes [2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9]. Check if valid. Row has 2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9. All unique. Column8 now has 9 added, which is allowed. \n\nNow, column6 for row3 is 8. Let's check if there's any conflict. Column6 now has 2 (row0), 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 8 (row3), ... So no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, moving to row4: [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 7, 0]. Let's look at this row. Missing numbers are columns1,2,4,6,8. Let's check each cell. But maybe start with cells that have fewer possibilities. Let's look at column1 for row4. Column1 has existing numbers: 5 (row0), 2 (row1), 8 (row2), 7 (row3), 0 (row4), 6 (row5), 1 (row6), 4 (row7), 0 (row8). So existing numbers are 5,2,8,7,6,1,4. Missing are 3,9. So cell (4,1) can be 3 or 9. Let's check the row's missing numbers. Row4's existing numbers are 5, 8, 9, 7. Missing are 1,2,3,4,6? Wait, row4 is [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 7, 0]. Existing numbers are 5,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,3,4,6. But column1 allows 3 and 9. So for cell (4,1), possible numbers are 3 (since 9 is already in the row). Wait, the row already has 9 in column5. So cell (4,1) can't be 9. Therefore, it must be 3. Let's put that in. Now row4 becomes [5,3, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 7, 0]. Now, column1 has 3 added. \n\nNow, check the row's missing numbers. Existing numbers are 5,3,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,4,6. Let's look at other cells. For example, cell (4,2) (column2). Column2 has existing numbers: row0:3; row1:7; row2:6; row3:1; row4:0; row5:9; row6:5; row7:0; row8:0. Existing numbers are 3,7,6,1,9,5. Missing are 2,4,8. Row4's missing are 1,2,4,6. So intersection is 2,4. So possible for cell (4,2) is 2 or 4. Also, check the block. Cell (4,2) is in the middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns 0-2). Let's check existing numbers in this block. Row3: [2,7,1]; row4: [5,3, ?]; row5: [0,6,9]. Existing numbers are 2,7,1,5,3,6,9. Missing are 4,8. Therefore, cell (4,2) must be 4 or 8. But from column2, it's 2 or 4. So the intersection is 4. Therefore, cell (4,2) must be 4. Let's fill that in. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8, 0,9, 0,7, 0]. \n\nNow, the block's missing is 8 for the remaining cell in the block. The remaining cell in the block is row5, column0. Let's check cell (5,0). Column0 has existing numbers: 1 (row0),9 (row1),4 (row2),2 (row3),5 (row4),0 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),6 (row8). Existing numbers are 1,9,4,2,5,6. Missing are 3,7,8. The block's missing is 8. So cell (5,0) must be 8. Let's check if that's valid. Row5 is [0,6,9,2,7,1,5,0,4]. Adding 8 to column0. Yes, column0 doesn't have 8 yet. So cell (5,0) is 8. Now row5 becomes [8,6,9,2,7,1,5,0,4]. \n\nNow, check row5's missing numbers. Existing numbers are 8,6,9,2,7,1,5,4. Missing is 3. So cell (5,7) must be 3. Let's fill that in. Now row5 is [8,6,9,2,7,1,5,3,4]. \n\nNow, back to row4: [5,3,4,8, 0,9, 0,7, 0]. Missing numbers in row4 are columns4,6,8. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,6. Let's look at cell (4,4) (column4). Column4 has existing numbers: row0:8; row1:5; row2:2; row3:3; row4:0; row5:7; row6:4; row7:9; row8:0. Existing numbers are 8,5,2,3,7,4,9. Missing are 1,6. Row4's missing are 1,2,6. So intersection is 1,6. Possible for cell (4,4) is 1 or 6. Also check the block. Cell (4,4) is in the middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). Wait, no. Let me check. The middle-middle block is rows3-5, columns3-5. Cell (4,4) is column4, which is in that block. Existing numbers in that block: row3's columns3-5:5,3,4; row4's columns3-5:8, 0,9; row5's columns3-5:2,7,1. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,9,2,7,1. Missing is 6. Therefore, cell (4,4) must be 6. Let's put that in. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8,6,9, 0,7, 0]. \n\nNow, the missing in row4 are columns6 and 8. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,6,9,7. Missing are 1,2. Let's check cell (4,6) (column6). Column6 has existing numbers: 2 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),5 (row5),0 (row6),7 (row7),0 (row8). Existing numbers are 2,4,1,8,5,7. Missing are 3,6,9. But row4's missing are 1 and 2. Wait, this is a contradiction. Wait, row4's missing numbers are 1 and 2? Wait, row4 is [5,3,4,8,6,9, 0,7, 0]. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,6,9,7. Missing are 1,2. But column6's existing numbers are 2,4,1, etc. So for cell (4,6), possible numbers are 1 or 2. But column6 already has 1 and 2? Let me check column6 again. Column6 has:\n\nrow0:2\n\nrow1:4\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow3:8\n\nrow4: ?\n\nrow5:5\n\nrow6: ?\n\nrow7:7\n\nrow8: ?\n\nSo existing numbers are 2,4,1,8,5,7. So missing are 3,6,9. But row4's missing are 1 and 2. Wait, but cell (4,6) is in column6, which already has 1 and 2. So this suggests a mistake. How is this possible? Did I make an error earlier?\n\nLet me retrace. Earlier, I assumed that cell (0,6) is 2 and (0,7) is 9. Then row0 is filled. Then row3's cell (3,6) is 8 and (3,8) is 9. Then row4's cell (4,1) is 3, cell (4,2) is 4. Then cell (5,0) is 8. Then cell (5,7) is 3. Then row4's cell (4,4) is 6. Now row4 is [5,3,4,8,6,9, 0,7, 0]. The missing in row4 are columns6 and 8. The row's existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,6,9,7. So missing are 1 and 2. But column6 for cell (4,6) has existing numbers 2,4,1, etc. So cell (4,6) can't be 1 or 2 because they are already present in column6. This indicates a contradiction. Which means my earlier assumption that cell (0,6) is 2 must be wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake there. \n\nThis means that cell (0,6) cannot be 2, so it must be 9, and cell (0,7) must be 2. Let's backtrack to that point.\n\nSo, going back: row0's cells (0,6) and (0,7) must be 9 and 2. Let's try putting 9 in (0,6) and 2 in (0,7). Now row0 becomes [1,5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7]. Check validity: row has 1,5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7. All unique. Column6 now has 9 added. Column7 has 2 added. Let's check column7: existing numbers are 8 (row1), 5 (row2), 6 (row3?), no, let me recheck. Column7 has row0:2; row1:8; row2:5; row3:6; row4:7; row5:0; row6:0; row7:1; row8:4. Existing numbers are 2,8,5,6,7,1,4. Missing are 3,9. So adding 2 to row0's column7 is okay.\n\nNow, proceeding with this correction. Let's re-examine the cells that were affected by this change.\n\nFirst, row0 is now filled. Let's look at row3 again: [2,7,1,5,3,4,0,6,0]. Missing numbers are columns6 and 8. Let's re-examine this. The row's existing numbers are 2,7,1,5,3,4,6. Missing are 8,9. \n\nNow, column6 for cell (3,6): existing numbers in column6 are 9 (row0), 4 (row1), 1 (row2), 0 (row3), ... Let me list column6 again. Column6 has:\n\nrow0:9\n\nrow1:4\n\nrow2:1\n\nrow3: ?\n\nrow4: ?\n\nrow5:5\n\nrow6: ?\n\nrow7:7\n\nrow8: ?\n\nExisting numbers are 9,4,1,5,7. Missing are 2,3,6,8. For cell (3,6), possible numbers are 8 or 9 (from row's missing). But row3's missing are 8 and 9. However, column6 already has 9 (row0), so cell (3,6) can't be 9. Therefore, it must be 8. So cell (3,6) is 8. Then cell (3,8) must be 9. Let's fill those in. Now row3 becomes [2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9]. This is the same as before. So no problem here. \n\nNow, moving to row4: [5, 0, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 7, 0]. Let's re-examine. Earlier steps where I filled in cell (4,1) as 3 and (4,2) as 4 still hold? Let's check.\n\nFor cell (4,1): column1 has existing numbers: row0:5; row1:2; row2:8; row3:7; row4:0; row5:6; row6:1; row7:4; row8:0. Existing numbers are 5,2,8,7,6,1,4. Missing are 3,9. Row4's existing numbers are 5, 8, 9, 7. Missing are 1,2,3,4,6. Wait, no. Wait, row4 is [5,0,0,8,0,9,0,7,0]. Existing numbers are 5,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,3,4,6. Column1 allows 3 or 9. Since row4 already has 9 in column5, cell (4,1) can't be 9. So it must be 3. So cell (4,1) is 3. Then row4 becomes [5,3, 0, 8, 0, 9, 0, 7, 0]. \n\nThen cell (4,2): column2 has existing numbers: row0:3; row1:7; row2:6; row3:1; row4:0; row5:9; row6:5; row7:0; row8:0. Existing are 3,7,6,1,9,5. Missing are 2,4,8. Row4's missing are 1,2,3,4,6. Wait, row4's existing are 5,3,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,4,6. So for cell (4,2), possible from column2 are 2,4,8. From row's missing are 1,2,4,6. Intersection is 2,4. Also, block (middle-middle) has existing numbers: row3: [2,7,1]; row4: [5,3, ?]; row5: [?,6,9]. Missing in block are 4,8. So cell (4,2) must be 4 or 8. Intersection with column2's 2,4,8 and row's 2,4 gives 4. So cell (4,2) is 4. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8,0,9,0,7,0]. \n\nThen, block's missing is 8 for cell (5,0). Let's check cell (5,0). Column0 has existing numbers: 1,9,4,2,5,0,0,0,6. Existing are 1,9,4,2,5,6. Missing are 3,7,8. Block's missing is 8. So cell (5,0) is 8. Now row5 becomes [8,6,9,2,7,1,5,0,4]. \n\nThen, row5's missing is column7: must be 3. So cell (5,7) is 3. Now row5 is [8,6,9,2,7,1,5,3,4]. \n\nNow, row4 is [5,3,4,8,0,9,0,7,0]. Missing in row4 are columns4,6,8. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,9,7. Missing are 1,2,6. \n\nCell (4,4): column4 has existing numbers: row0:8; row1:5; row2:2; row3:3; row4:0; row5:7; row6:4; row7:9; row8:0. Existing are 8,5,2,3,7,4,9. Missing are 1,6. Row4's missing are 1,2,6. So intersection is 1,6. Check block for cell (4,4): middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). Existing numbers: row3's columns3-5:5,3,4; row4's columns3-5:8, 0,9; row5's columns3-5:2,7,1. Existing are 5,3,4,8,9,2,7,1. Missing is 6. Therefore, cell (4,4) must be 6. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8,6,9,0,7,0]. \n\nNow, missing in row4 are columns6 and 8. Existing numbers are 5,3,4,8,6,9,7. Missing are 1,2. \n\nCell (4,6): column6 has existing numbers:9 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),5 (row5),0 (row6),7 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 9,4,1,8,5,7. Missing are 2,3,6. Row4's missing are 1 and 2. Wait, row4's missing are 1 and 2? But column6's missing are 2,3,6. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (4,6) must be 2. Let's fill that in. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7,0]. Now, the missing in row4 is column8, which must be 1 (since row's missing are 1 and 2, and 2 is already placed). Let's check column8 for cell (4,8). Column8 has existing numbers:7 (row0),6 (row1),3 (row2),9 (row3),0 (row4),4 (row5),2 (row6),0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing are 7,6,3,9,4,2,8. Missing are 1,5. Row4's missing is 1. So cell (4,8) is 1. Now row4 becomes [5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7,1]. Check validity: all numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, moving to row6: [0,1,5,3,4,8,0,0,2]. Let's look at this row. Missing numbers in row6 are columns0,6,7. Existing numbers are 1,5,3,4,8,2. Missing are 6,7,9. Let's check column0 for cell (6,0). Column0 has existing numbers:1 (row0),9 (row1),4 (row2),2 (row3),5 (row4),8 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),6 (row8). Existing are 1,9,4,2,5,8,6. Missing are 3,7. But row6's missing are 6,7,9. So intersection is 7. Therefore, cell (6,0) must be 7. Let's fill that in. Now row6 becomes [7,1,5,3,4,8,0,0,2]. \n\nNow, missing in row6 are columns6 and 7. Existing numbers are 7,1,5,3,4,8,2. Missing are 6,9. \n\nCheck column6 for cell (6,6). Column6 has existing numbers:9 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),8 (row3),2 (row4),5 (row5),0 (row6),7 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 9,4,1,8,2,5,7. Missing are 3,6. Row6's missing are 6,9. Intersection is 6. So cell (6,6) must be 6. Let's fill that in. Now row6 becomes [7,1,5,3,4,8,6,0,2]. \n\nNow, missing in row6 is column7. The row's missing is 9. So cell (6,7) must be 9. Let's check column7. Column7 has existing numbers:2 (row0),8 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3),7 (row4),3 (row5),0 (row6),1 (row7),4 (row8). Existing are 2,8,5,6,7,3,1,4. Missing is 9. So yes, cell (6,7) is 9. Now row6 is [7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9,2]. \n\nNow, moving to row7: [0,4,0,0,9,2,7,1,0]. Let's look at this row. Missing numbers in row7 are columns0,2,3,8. Existing numbers are 4,9,2,7,1. Missing are 3,5,6,8. Let's check column0 for cell (7,0). Column0 has existing numbers:1,9,4,2,5,8,7,0,6. Existing are 1,9,4,2,5,8,7,6. Missing is 3. So cell (7,0) must be 3. Let's fill that in. Now row7 becomes [3,4,0,0,9,2,7,1,0]. \n\nNow, missing in row7 are columns2,3,8. Existing numbers are 3,4,9,2,7,1. Missing are 5,6,8. \n\nLet's look at column2 for cell (7,2). Column2 has existing numbers:3 (row0),7 (row1),6 (row2),1 (row3),4 (row4),9 (row5),5 (row6),0 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 3,7,6,1,4,9,5. Missing are 2,8. Row7's missing are 5,6,8. Intersection is 8. So cell (7,2) must be 8. Let's fill that in. Now row7 becomes [3,4,8,0,9,2,7,1,0]. \n\nNow, missing in row7 are columns3 and 8. Existing numbers are 3,4,8,9,2,7,1. Missing are 5,6. \n\nCheck column3 for cell (7,3). Column3 has existing numbers:4 (row0),1 (row1),9 (row2),5 (row3),8 (row4),2 (row5),3 (row6),0 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 4,1,9,5,8,2,3. Missing are 6,7. Row7's missing are 5,6. Intersection is 6. So cell (7,3) must be 6. Let's fill that in. Now row7 becomes [3,4,8,6,9,2,7,1,0]. \n\nNow, missing in row7 is column8. The row's missing is 5. Let's check column8 for cell (7,8). Column8 has existing numbers:7 (row0),6 (row1),3 (row2),9 (row3),1 (row4),4 (row5),2 (row6),0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing are 7,6,3,9,1,4,2,8. Missing is 5. So cell (7,8) is 5. Now row7 becomes [3,4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5]. \n\nNow, moving to row8: [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 8]. Let's look at this row. Missing numbers in row8 are columns1,2,3,4,6. Existing numbers are 6,5,4,8. Missing are 1,2,3,7,9. Let's check column1 for cell (8,1). Column1 has existing numbers:5 (row0),2 (row1),8 (row2),7 (row3),3 (row4),6 (row5),1 (row6),4 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 5,2,8,7,3,6,1,4. Missing is 9. So cell (8,1) must be 9. Let's fill that in. Now row8 becomes [6,9,0,0,0,5,0,4,8]. \n\nNow, missing in row8 are columns2,3,4,6. Existing numbers are 6,9,5,4,8. Missing are 1,2,3,7. \n\nLet's look at column2 for cell (8,2). Column2 has existing numbers:3 (row0),7 (row1),6 (row2),1 (row3),4 (row4),9 (row5),5 (row6),8 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 3,7,6,1,4,9,5,8. Missing is 2. So cell (8,2) must be 2. Let's fill that in. Now row8 becomes [6,9,2,0,0,5,0,4,8]. \n\nNow, missing in row8 are columns3,4,6. Existing numbers are 6,9,2,5,4,8. Missing are 1,3,7. \n\nCheck column3 for cell (8,3). Column3 has existing numbers:4 (row0),1 (row1),9 (row2),5 (row3),8 (row4),2 (row5),3 (row6),6 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 4,1,9,5,8,2,3,6. Missing is 7. So cell (8,3) must be 7. Let's fill that in. Now row8 becomes [6,9,2,7,0,5,0,4,8]. \n\nNow, missing in row8 are columns4 and 6. Existing numbers are 6,9,2,7,5,4,8. Missing are 1,3. \n\nCheck column4 for cell (8,4). Column4 has existing numbers:8 (row0),5 (row1),2 (row2),3 (row3),6 (row4),7 (row5),4 (row6),9 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 8,5,2,3,6,7,4,9. Missing is 1. So cell (8,4) must be 1. Let's fill that in. Now row8 becomes [6,9,2,7,1,5,0,4,8]. \n\nNow, missing in row8 is column6. The row's missing is 3. Let's check column6 for cell (8,6). Column6 has existing numbers:9 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),8 (row3),2 (row4),5 (row5),6 (row6),7 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 9,4,1,8,2,5,6,7. Missing is 3. So cell (8,6) must be 3. Now row8 becomes [6,9,2,7,1,5,3,4,8]. \n\nNow, let's check if all rows, columns, and blocks are valid. \n\nLet's check row8: [6,9,2,7,1,5,3,4,8]. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. \n\nNow, check row7: [3,4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5]. Valid. \n\nCheck row6: [7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9,2]. Valid. \n\nRow5: [8,6,9,2,7,1,5,3,4]. Valid. \n\nRow4: [5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7,1]. Valid. \n\nRow3: [2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6,9]. Valid. \n\nRow2: [4,8,6,9,2,7,1,5,3]. Valid. \n\nRow1: [9,2,7,1,5,3,4,8,6]. Valid. \n\nRow0: [1,5,3,4,8,6,9,2,7]. Valid. \n\nNow, check columns. For example, column0: [1,9,4,2,5,8,7,3,6]. All unique. Column1: [5,2,8,7,3,6,1,4,9]. All unique. Column2: [3,7,6,1,4,9,5,8,2]. All unique. And so on for other columns. \n\nCheck 3x3 blocks. For example, the top-left block: rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Values: [1,5,3], [9,2,7], [4,8,6]. All numbers 1-9. \n\nMiddle-middle block: rows3-5, columns3-5: [5,3,4], [8,6,9], [2,7,1]. All numbers 1-9. \n\nBottom-right block: rows6-8, columns6-8: [6,9,2], [7,1,5], [3,4,8]. All numbers. \n\nLooks like all constraints are satisfied. So the Sudoku is solved.\n ;Answer: [[1, 5, 3, 4, 8, 6, 9, 2, 7], [9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8, 6], [4, 8, 6, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3], [2, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8, 6, 9], [5, 3, 4, 8, 6, 9, 2, 7, 1], [8, 6, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4], [7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8, 6, 9, 2], [3, 4, 8, 6, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5], [6, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4, 8]]"

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where to start. The rules are that each row, column, and 3x3 block must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition. Let me start by scanning each row, column, and block for obvious missing numbers.\n\nLooking at the first row: [0, 0, 2, 6, 8, 0, 0, 3, 7]. The missing numbers here are 1, 4, 5, 9. Let's check the columns and blocks for possible placements. The first row is part of the top-left 3x3 block. Let's look at that block. The first three rows and first three columns. The existing numbers in this block are 2 (from row 1, column 3), 5 (row 2, column 1), 7 (row 2, column 3), 6 (row 3, column 1), 8 (row 3, column 2). So missing numbers here are 1, 3, 4, 9. Wait, but row 1's first two cells are 0. Maybe looking at column 1. Column 1 has existing numbers: 5 (row 2), 6 (row 3), 3 (row 4), 8 (row 5), and zeros elsewhere. So possible numbers for column 1 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 9. But in the top-left block, we need to place numbers. For cell (1,1), which is row 1 column 1. Since the block already has 5, 6, 2, 7, 8, missing are 1, 3, 4, 9. But column 1 can't have 5,6,3,8. Let me check if there's a unique possibility. Maybe not yet. Let's look for cells with only one possible number.\n\nLooking at row 3: [6, 8, 0, 5, 0, 7, 1, 0, 2]. The missing numbers here are 3, 4, 9 in the third column, fifth column, and eighth column. Let's check column 3. Column 3 has existing numbers: 2 (row 1), 7 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 0 (row 5), 6 (row 6), 4 (row 7), 3 (row 8), 8 (row 9). Wait, row 3 column 3 is 0. Column 3's existing numbers are 2,7,6,4,3,8. Missing are 1,5,9. But row 3's third column is in the top-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Wait, no, column 3 is in the first three columns. Wait, column 3 is part of the top-left block (columns 1-3). So for cell (3,3), which is row 3, column 3. The block already has 6,8, etc. Let me think again. The row 3 has 6,8,?,5,?,7,1,?,2. Missing in row 3 are 3,4,9. Let's check column 5. Row 3's fifth column is 0. Column 5 has existing numbers: 8 (row 1),4 (row 2),0 (row 3), 2 (row 4),7 (row 5),9 (row 6),6 (row 7),0 (row 8),5 (row 9). So missing in column 5 are 1,3, maybe. Wait, column 5 has 8,4,2,7,9,6,5. Missing are 1,3. So row 3's fifth column must be either 1 or 3. But row 3's missing numbers are 3,4,9. So if column 5's cell can only be 1 or 3, then maybe it's 3? Because 1 isn't in row 3's missing numbers. Wait, row 3's missing numbers are 3,4,9. Column 5's cell can only be 1 or 3. Since 1 is not in row 3's missing, the cell must be 3. Therefore, row 3, column 5 is 3. Let me check if that's valid. Yes, because column 5 doesn't have 3 yet, and the block (middle-middle block? Wait row 3, column 5 is in the middle-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). The middle-middle block has existing numbers: row 1 columns 4-6 are 6,8,0; row 2 columns 4-6 are 1,4,2; row 3 columns 4-6 are 5,3,7. So adding 3 here would be okay. So row 3, column 5 is 3. Then, row 3's missing numbers are now 4 and 9. Let's look at the eighth column (row 3, column 8 is 0). Column 8 has existing numbers: 3 (row 1), 8 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 9 (row 4), 2 (row 5),7 (row 6), 0 (row 7), 0 (row 8), 1 (row 9). Missing are 1,4,5,6. But row 3's missing are 4 and 9. So the eighth column's cell must be 4 or 9. Let's check the block. Row 3, column 8 is in the top-right block (rows 1-3, columns 7-9). The existing numbers in that block are: row 1 columns 7-9: 0,3,7; row 2 columns 7-9: 6,8,0; row 3 columns 7-9: 1, 0, 2. So existing numbers are 3,7,6,8,1,2. Missing are 4,5,9. So row 3's column 8 can be 4 or 9. Let's see if there's a way to determine which. Since row 3's missing are 4 and 9, and column 8's cell must be one of those. Let me check other cells in row 3. The third column (row 3, column 3) is 0. The missing numbers for row 3 are 4 and 9. Let's check column 3. Column 3 has existing numbers: 2 (row 1), 7 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 0 (row 5), 6 (row 6), 4 (row 7), 3 (row 8), 8 (row 9). So missing in column 3 are 1,5,9. But row 3's missing in row are 4 and 9. Wait, but the cell (3,3) is in row 3, so the number must be in row's missing (4 or 9). But column 3's missing numbers are 1,5,9. Therefore, the cell can only be 9. Because 4 isn't missing in column 3. So row 3, column 3 is 9. Then row 3's missing is 4. So the remaining cell in row 3 is column 8, which must be 4. Let me check: column 8's cell (row 3) is 4. That's allowed. So now row 3 is [6,8,9,5,3,7,1,4,2]. Let me note that down.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's check other cells. Let's look at row 2: [5, 0, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 0]. Missing numbers are 3, 9. Because existing numbers are 5,7,1,4,2,6,8. So missing are 3,9. Let's check column 2. Column 2 has existing numbers: 0 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 8 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 9 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 1 (row 7),5 (row 8),6 (row 9). So missing are 2,3,4,7. But row 2's missing are 3 and 9. So for row 2, column 2, the cell must be 3 or 9. But column 2 can't have 9? Let me check column 2. Existing numbers in column 2: row 3 has 8, row 5 has 9, row 7 has 1, row 8 has 5, row 9 has 6. So column 2 doesn't have 9 yet. Wait, row 5, column 2 is 9. So column 2 has 9 in row 5. Therefore, row 2's column 2 cannot be 9. So the only possibility is 3. Therefore, row 2, column 2 is 3. Then, row 2's last cell (column 9) must be 9. Let me check column 9. Column 9 has existing numbers: 7 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 2 (row 3), 5 (row 4), 0 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 3 (row 7), 0 (row 8), 0 (row 9). Adding 9 here (row 2, column 9) is allowed. So row 2 becomes [5,3,7,1,4,2,6,8,9].\n\nNow, let's look at row 1: [0, 0, 2, 6, 8, 0, 0, 3, 7]. Missing numbers are 1,4,5,9. Let's check column 1. Column 1 has existing numbers: row 2 has 5, row 3 has 6, row 4 has 3, row 5 has 8, others are 0. So missing in column 1 are 1,2,4,7,9. But row 1's first cell is column 1. The row's missing are 1,4,5,9. But column 1 can't have 5 (already in row 2). So possible numbers for row 1, column 1 are 1,4,9. Let's look at the block (top-left). The top-left block (rows 1-3, columns 1-3) has existing numbers: row 1: [0,0,2], row 2: [5,3,7], row 3: [6,8,9]. So existing numbers are 2,5,3,7,6,8,9. Missing are 1,4. Therefore, row 1's first two cells (columns 1 and 2) must be 1 and 4. Let's check column 1 again. For row 1, column 1, possible numbers are 1,4,9. But the block says it can only be 1 or 4. So 9 is excluded. Therefore, row 1, column 1 is either 1 or 4. Let's look at column 2 for row 1, column 2. Column 2's existing numbers: row 1 is 0, row 2 is 3, row 3 is 8, row 4 is 0, row 5 is 9, row 6 is 0, row 7 is 1, row 8 is 5, row 9 is 6. Missing in column 2 are 2,4,7. But row 1's missing numbers are 1,4,5,9. Wait, row 1's missing numbers are 1,4,5,9. But column 2's cell for row 1 can only be 2,4,7. But row 1 can't have 2 or 7 here. Therefore, the only possible value is 4. So row 1, column 2 must be 4. Then, in the top-left block, the remaining missing number is 1, which must be in row 1, column 1. So row 1, column 1 is 1. Now row 1 becomes [1,4,2,6,8,0,0,3,7]. The missing numbers now are 5 and 9 in row 1. Let's check the sixth column (row 1, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers: row 1 is 0, row 2 is 2, row 3 is 7, row 4 is 0, row 5 is 1, row 6 is 0, row 7 is 8, row 8 is 4, row 9 is 0. So missing in column 6 are 3,5,6,9. But row 1's missing are 5 and 9. So possible values are 5 or 9. Let's check the block. Row 1, column 6 is in the top-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Existing numbers in that block: row 1 columns 4-6: 6,8,0; row 2 columns 4-6: 1,4,2; row 3 columns 4-6: 5,3,7. Existing numbers are 6,8,1,4,2,5,3,7. Missing are 9. Wait, that can't be. Wait, row 1 column 4 is 6, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 0. The block's existing numbers: 6,8 (row 1), 1,4,2 (row 2), 5,3,7 (row 3). So missing in the block is 9. Therefore, row 1, column 6 must be 9. Then, the remaining cell in row 1 is column 7, which must be 5. Let's check column 7. Column 7 has existing numbers: row 1 is 0, row 2 is 6, row 3 is 1, row 4 is 8, row 5 is 0, row 6 is 3, row 7 is 9, row 8 is 2, row 9 is 0. Adding 5 here (row 1, column 7) is allowed. So row 1 becomes [1,4,2,6,8,9,5,3,7]. \n\nNow, moving to row 4: [3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 9, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,4,6,7. Let's check column 2 (row 4, column 2 is 0). Column 2's existing numbers are 4 (row 1), 3 (row 2), 8 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 9 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 1 (row 7), 5 (row 8), 6 (row 9). Missing in column 2 are 2,4,7. But row 4's missing numbers are 1,4,6,7. So possible values for row 4, column 2 are 4 or 7. Let's look at the block. Row 4 is in the middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). Existing numbers in this block: row 4: 3, 0, 0; row 5: 8,9,0; row 6: 0,0,6. Let's see existing numbers: 3,8,9,6. Missing are 1,2,4,5,7. But row 4's column 2 is in this block. So possible values are 4 or 7. Let me check other cells in this block. For example, row 5, column 3 is 0. Let's see if there's any other constraints. Maybe not yet. Let's look at row 4's other cells. Let's check column 3 (row 4, column 3 is 0). Column 3's existing numbers: 2 (row 1),7 (row 2),9 (row 3), 0 (row 4),0 (row 5),6 (row 6),4 (row 7),3 (row 8),8 (row 9). Missing are 1,5. Wait, row 4's missing numbers are 1,4,6,7. So column 3's cell can't be 1 or 5. Therefore, this cell must be something else. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck. Column 3 has existing numbers 2,7,9,6,4,3,8. Missing are 1,5. But row 4's column 3 is part of row 4, which has missing numbers 1,4,6,7. Therefore, this cell must be 1 or 5, but row 4's missing numbers don't include 5. Therefore, this cell must be 1. So row 4, column 3 is 1. Then, row 4's missing numbers are now 4,6,7. Let me check if that's correct. Column 3: adding 1 here. Now, row 4's column 3 is 1. Then, the block (middle-left) now has 3,1, and others. Let me proceed. Now, row 4 is [3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 8, 9, 5]. Missing numbers are 4,6,7 in the row. Let's check column 2 again. Now, row 4, column 2 can be 4 or 7. Let's see. Column 2's missing are 2,4,7. But row 4's column 2 can't be 2 (since row 4's missing are 4,6,7). Therefore, it's either 4 or 7. Let's look at the block. Middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). Existing numbers in the block: row 4: 3, ?, 1; row 5: 8,9,?; row 6: ?, ?, 6. Existing numbers are 3,1,8,9,6. Missing are 2,4,5,7. So row 4, column 2 can be 4 or 7. Let's see if there's another cell in the block that can help. For example, row 5, column 3 is 0. Column 3's existing numbers are 1 (row 4), so column 3's missing are 5. Wait no, earlier I thought column 3's missing were 1,5, but after adding 1 in row 4, column 3, column 3's missing are 5. Wait, column 3's existing numbers are 2,7,9,1,6,4,3,8. So missing is 5. Therefore, row 5, column 3 must be 5. Because column 3's only missing is 5. So row 5, column 3 is 5. Now, row 5 is [8,9,5, 0, 7, 1, 0, 2, 0]. Let me check row 5's missing numbers. Existing numbers are 8,9,5,7,1,2. Missing are 3,4,6. Let's check column 4 (row 5, column 4 is 0). Column 4's existing numbers: row 1:6, row 2:1, row 3:5, row 4:0, row 5:0, row 6:8, row 7:2, row 8:7, row 9:0. So column 4 has 6,1,5,8,2,7. Missing are 3,4,9. But row 5's missing numbers are 3,4,6. Therefore, row 5's column 4 can be 3 or 4. Let's check the block. Row 5 is in the middle-middle block (rows 4-6, columns 4-6). Existing numbers in this block: row 4 columns 4-6: 0, 2, 0; row 5 columns 4-6: 0,7,1; row 6 columns 4-6:8,9,0. Existing numbers are 2,7,1,8,9. Missing are 3,4,5,6. But row 5's column 4 can be 3 or 4. Let me check other constraints. For example, row 5's column 7 is 0. Let's see. Maybe not helpful yet. Let's go back to row 4's column 2. Now, the middle-left block has row 5, column 3 as 5. So the missing in the block are 2,4,7. For row 4, column 2 (possible 4 or 7), and for row 6, columns 1 and 2. Let's see if there's another cell in the block that can be filled. For example, row 6, column 1 is 0. Column 1's existing numbers are 1 (row 1), 5 (row 2), 6 (row 3), 3 (row 4), 8 (row 5), others are 0. So column 1 missing are 2,4,7,9. But the middle-left block's missing are 2,4,7. So row 6, column 1 must be one of those. Let me think if there's a way to determine. Maybe not yet. Let's return to row 4's column 2. If we can find another constraint. Let's look at row 4's column 4 (0). Column 4's existing numbers are 6,1,5,8,2,7. Missing are 3,4,9. Row 4's missing numbers are 4,6,7. So row 4's column 4 can be 3 or 4 or 9? Wait, row 4's missing numbers are 4,6,7. But column 4's possible values are 3,4,9. Therefore, the cell can be 4. Because 4 is in row's missing and column's missing. Let me check if there's a way to determine. For example, if the block (middle-middle) allows 4. The block's missing are 3,4,5,6. But row 4's column 4 is in this block. If the cell is 4, then that's allowed. But how do I know? Maybe looking at other cells. Let me check row 4's column 6 (0). Column 6's existing numbers are 9 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 7 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 1 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 8 (row 7), 4 (row 8), 0 (row 9). Missing are 3,5,6. Row 4's missing numbers are 4,6,7. Therefore, column 6's cell can be 6 (since 6 is in row's missing). So if row 4's column 6 is 6, then that's allowed. Let me check if that's possible. If I assume that, then maybe other cells can be filled. Let me try. Suppose row 4, column 6 is 6. Then row 4's missing numbers become 4 and 7. Let's check column 6: adding 6 here is okay. Now, row 4 is [3, 0, 1, 0, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5]. Now, the missing numbers in row 4 are 4 and 7. Let's look at column 2 (row 4, column 2). Possible values are 4 or 7. Let's check the block. Middle-left block's missing are 2,4,7. If row 4, column 2 is 4, then the remaining missing in the block are 2 and 7. Let's see if that's possible. Let me check other cells in the block. For example, row 6, column 1 and 2. Let me think. Maybe there's another way. Let's check row 4's column 4 (0). Column 4's missing are 3,4,9. Row 4's missing are 4 and 7. So if column 4's cell is 4, then that's allowed. Let me check the block (middle-middle). If row 4, column 4 is 4, then that's part of the block's missing. So possible. Let's assume that. Then, row 4's column 4 is 4, and row 4's column 2 is 7. Let's check if that works. If row 4's column 2 is 7, then column 2 would have 7 in row 4. Is that allowed? Column 2 currently has 4 (row 1), 3 (row 2), 8 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 9 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 1 (row 7), 5 (row 8), 6 (row 9). Adding 7 here is okay. Then, row 4 would be [3,7,1,4,2,6,8,9,5]. Now, the row is complete. Let me check if this works. Yes, all numbers 1-9 are present. Now, the block (middle-left) has row 4, column 2 as 7. The block's existing numbers are 3,7,1 (row 4); 8,9,5 (row 5); and row 6's columns 1-3 are ?, ?, 6. Missing in the block are 2 and 4. Let's see if that's okay. Now, moving on. Let's check row 4's completion. With this, row 4 is filled. Now, let's proceed to other cells.\n\nNow, row 6: [0, 0, 6, 8, 9, 0, 3, 7, 0]. Missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. Let's check column 1 (row 6, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers are 1 (row 1),5 (row 2),6 (row 3),3 (row 4),8 (row 5), others are 0. Missing are 2,4,7,9. Row 6's missing are 1,2,4,5. So possible values for column 1 are 2,4. Let's check the block (middle-left). The block's missing are 2 and 4 (as previously determined). Therefore, row 6, column 1 must be 2 or 4. Let's look at other cells in the block. For example, row 6, column 2 is 0. Column 2's existing numbers are 4 (row 1),3 (row 2),8 (row 3),7 (row 4),9 (row 5), others are 0. Missing in column 2 are 2, maybe. Wait, column 2's existing numbers are 4,3,8,7,9,1,5,6. Missing are 2. Therefore, row 6, column 2 must be 2. Because column 2's missing is 2. Therefore, row 6, column 2 is 2. Then, in the middle-left block, since row 6, column 2 is 2, the remaining missing is 4 in the block, which must be in row 6, column 1. So row 6, column 1 is 4. Now, row 6 becomes [4,2,6,8,9,0,3,7,0]. Missing numbers are 1,5. Let's check column 6 (row 6, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers are 9 (row 1), 2 (row 2), 7 (row 3), 6 (row 4), 1 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 8 (row 7), 4 (row 8), 0 (row 9). Missing are 3,5. But row 6's missing are 1 and 5. Therefore, this cell must be 5. So row 6, column 6 is 5. Then, row 6's last missing is 1 in column 9. Let's check column 9. Column 9 has existing numbers: 7 (row 1),9 (row 2),2 (row 3),5 (row 4),0 (row 5),0 (row 6),3 (row 7),0 (row 8),0 (row 9). Adding 1 here is allowed. So row 6 becomes [4,2,6,8,9,5,3,7,1]. \n\nNow, row 5 is [8,9,5, 0, 7, 1, 0, 2, 0]. Missing numbers are 3,4,6. Let's check column 4 (row 5, column 4 is 0). Column 4's existing numbers are 6 (row 1),1 (row 2),5 (row 3),4 (row 4),8 (row 6),2 (row 7),7 (row 8). Missing are 3,9. But row 5's missing are 3,4,6. Therefore, this cell must be 3. Because column 4's missing are 3 and 9, and row 5's missing includes 3. So row 5, column 4 is 3. Now, row 5 becomes [8,9,5,3,7,1,0,2,0]. Missing are 4 and 6. Let's check column 7 (row 5, column 7 is 0). Column 7's existing numbers: 5 (row 1),6 (row 2),1 (row 3),8 (row 4),0 (row 5),3 (row 6),9 (row 7),2 (row 8),0 (row 9). Missing are 4,7. But row 5's missing are 4 and 6. Therefore, this cell must be 4. So row 5, column 7 is 4. Then, row 5's last missing is 6 in column 9. Let's check column 9. Column 9 has existing numbers: 7,9,2,5,1,3. Adding 6 here is allowed. So row 5 becomes [8,9,5,3,7,1,4,2,6]. \n\nNow, let's move to row 7: [0, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 0, 3]. Missing numbers are 5 and 7. Let's check column 1 (row 7, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers: 1,5,6,3,8,4, others are 0. Missing are 2,7,9. But row 7's missing are 5 and 7. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, row 7's current numbers are [0,1,4,2,6,8,9,0,3]. Missing are 5 and 7. Column 1's existing numbers are 1 (row 1),5 (row 2),6 (row 3),3 (row 4),8 (row 5),4 (row 6), others are 0. So column 1's existing numbers are 1,5,6,3,8,4. Missing are 2,7,9. But row 7's missing are 5 and 7. Wait, but 5 is already in column 1 (row 2). So row 7's column 1 can't be 5. Therefore, row 7's missing in row are 5 and 7, but column 1 can't have 5. Therefore, row 7, column 1 must be 7. Then, the remaining missing number in row 7 is 5, which must be in column 8. Let me check column 8 (row 7, column 8 is 0). Column 8's existing numbers: 3 (row 1),8 (row 2),4 (row 3),9 (row 4),2 (row 5),7 (row 6),0 (row 7),0 (row 8),1 (row 9). Missing are 1,5,6. But row 7's missing is 5. So adding 5 here is allowed. Therefore, row 7 becomes [7,1,4,2,6,8,9,5,3].\n\nNow, row 8: [0,5,3,7,0,4,2,0,0]. Missing numbers are 1,6,8,9. Let's check column 1 (row 8, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers are 1,5,6,3,8,4,7 (row 7). Missing are 2,9. But row 8's missing are 1,6,8,9. Therefore, this cell can't be filled yet. Let's look at other cells. Let's check column 5 (row 8, column 5 is 0). Column 5's existing numbers: 8 (row 1),4 (row 2),3 (row 3),2 (row 4),7 (row 5),9 (row 6),6 (row 7),0 (row 8),5 (row 9). Missing are 1. Therefore, row 8, column 5 must be 1. So row 8 becomes [0,5,3,7,1,4,2,0,0]. Now, row 8's missing numbers are 6,8,9. Let's check column 1 again. Now, column 1's missing are 2 and 9. But row 8's column 1 must be one of 6,8,9? Wait, row 8's missing are 6,8,9. But column 1's missing are 2 and 9. So the only possible value for row 8, column 1 is 9. Therefore, row 8, column 1 is 9. Now, row 8 becomes [9,5,3,7,1,4,2,0,0]. Missing numbers are 6 and 8. Let's check column 8 (row 8, column 8 is 0). Column 8's existing numbers: 3,8,4,9,2,7,5 (row 7), others are 0. Missing are 1,6. But row 8's missing are 6 and 8. So column 8 can't have 8 here. Therefore, row 8's column 8 must be 6. Then, row 8's column 9 is 8. Let me check column 9. Column 9 has existing numbers: 7 (row 1),9 (row 2),2 (row 3),5 (row 4),6 (row 5),1 (row 6),3 (row 7),0 (row 8),0 (row 9). Adding 8 here is allowed. So row 8 becomes [9,5,3,7,1,4,2,6,8].\n\nNow, row 9: [0, 6, 8, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Missing numbers are 2,3,4,7,9. Let's check column 1 (row 9, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers are 1,5,6,3,8,4,7,9. Missing is 2. So row 9, column 1 must be 2. Now, row 9 becomes [2,6,8,0,5,0,0,1,0]. Missing numbers are 3,4,7,9. Let's check column 4 (row 9, column 4 is 0). Column 4's existing numbers: 6,1,5,4,3,8,2,7. Missing is 9. So row 9, column 4 must be 9. Now, row 9 becomes [2,6,8,9,5,0,0,1,0]. Missing numbers are 3,4,7. Let's check column 6 (row 9, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers: 9,2,7,6,1,5,8,4. Missing are 3. So row 9, column 6 must be 3. Now, row 9 becomes [2,6,8,9,5,3,0,1,0]. Missing numbers are 4 and 7. Let's check column 7 (row 9, column 7 is 0). Column 7's existing numbers: 5,6,1,8,4,3,9,2. Missing are 7. So row 9, column 7 is 7. Then, row 9's last missing is 4 in column 9. Let's check column 9. Column 9 has existing numbers: 7,9,2,5,6,1,3,8. Missing are 4. So row 9, column 9 is 4. Therefore, row 9 becomes [2,6,8,9,5,3,7,1,4].\n\nNow, let's check if all rows, columns, and blocks are valid.\n\nLet me verify row 7: [7,1,4,2,6,8,9,5,3]. All numbers 1-9, no repeats. Good.\n\nRow 8: [9,5,3,7,1,4,2,6,8]. All numbers. Good.\n\nRow 9: [2,6,8,9,5,3,7,1,4]. All numbers. Good.\n\nNow, check row 7's block (bottom-left). Rows 7-9, columns 1-3: [7,1,4], [9,5,3], [2,6,8]. All numbers 1-9. Good.\n\nCheck column 7 for any issues. Column 7 has 5 (row1),6 (row2),1 (row3),8 (row4),4 (row5),3 (row6),9 (row7),2 (row8),7 (row9). All unique. Good.\n\nNow, check the remaining cells. Let me check row 7's block. All good. Let me check if any other cells were missed. Let's check row 7's column 8 is 5, which is correct.\n\nNow, let me check the entire board:\n\nRow 1: [1,4,2,6,8,9,5,3,7]\n\nRow 2: [5,3,7,1,4,2,6,8,9]\n\nRow 3: [6,8,9,5,3,7,1,4,2]\n\nRow 4: [3,7,1,4,2,6,8,9,5]\n\nRow 5: [8,9,5,3,7,1,4,2,6]\n\nRow 6: [4,2,6,8,9,5,3,7,1]\n\nRow 7: [7,1,4,2,6,8,9,5,3]\n\nRow 8: [9,5,3,7,1,4,2,6,8]\n\nRow 9: [2,6,8,9,5,3,7,1,4]\n\nAll rows seem to have numbers 1-9. Let me check columns:\n\nColumn 1: 1,5,6,3,8,4,7,9,2 → 1-9, no duplicates.\n\nColumn 2: 4,3,8,7,9,2,1,5,6 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 3: 2,7,9,1,5,6,4,3,8 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 4: 6,1,5,4,3,8,2,7,9 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 5: 8,4,3,2,7,9,6,1,5 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 6: 9,2,7,6,1,5,8,4,3 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 7: 5,6,1,8,4,3,9,2,7 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 8: 3,8,4,9,2,7,5,6,1 → 1-9.\n\nColumn 9: 7,9,2,5,6,1,3,8,4 → 1-9.\n\nAll columns are valid. Now check 3x3 blocks:\n\nTop-left: rows 1-3, columns 1-3:\n\n1,4,2\n\n5,3,7\n\n6,8,9 → 1-9.\n\nTop-middle: rows 1-3, columns 4-6:\n\n6,8,9\n\n1,4,2\n\n5,3,7 → 1-9.\n\nTop-right: rows 1-3, columns 7-9:\n\n5,3,7\n\n6,8,9\n\n1,4,2 → 1-9.\n\nMiddle-left: rows 4-6, columns 1-3:\n\n3,7,1\n\n8,9,5\n\n4,2,6 → 1-9.\n\nMiddle-middle: rows 4-6, columns 4-6:\n\n4,2,6\n\n3,7,1\n\n8,9,5 → 1-9.\n\nMiddle-right: rows 4-6, columns 7-9:\n\n8,9,5\n\n4,2,6\n\n3,7,1 → 1-9.\n\nBottom-left: rows 7-9, columns 1-3:\n\n7,1,4\n\n9,5,3\n\n2,6,8 → 1-9.\n\nBottom-middle: rows 7-9, columns 4-6:\n\n2,6,8\n\n7,1,4\n\n9,5,3 → 1-9.\n\nBottom-right: rows 7-9, columns 7-9:\n\n9,5,3\n\n2,6,8\n\n7,1,4 → 1-9.\n\nAll blocks are valid. So the Sudoku is solved correctly.\n ;Answer: [[1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 7], [5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9], [6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 2], [3, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5], [8, 9, 5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6], [4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 7, 1], [7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3], [9, 5, 3, 7, 1, 4, 2, 6, 8], [2, 6, 8, 9, 5, 3, 7, 1, 4]]"

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where to start. The goal is to fill in the zeros with numbers 1-9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 block has all numbers without repetition. \n\nStarting with the first row: [0, 8, 4, 0, 1, 0, 9, 2, 0]. Let me check the existing numbers. There's 8, 4, 1, 9, 2. Missing numbers are 3, 5, 6, 7. Let's look at each empty cell. The first cell is row 1, column 1. Let's check column 1. The column has existing numbers: looking down column 1: the first row is 0, then in row 2 it's 0, row3 is 3, row4 is 8, row5 is 1, row6 is 0, row7 is 5, row8 is 0, row9 is 4. So column 1 has 3,8,1,5,4. Missing are 2,6,7,9. Wait, but in row 1's first cell, the column allows numbers not in that list. But the row's missing numbers are 3,5,6,7. So possible numbers for (1,1) are intersection of row's missing and column's missing. Wait, row's missing numbers are 3,5,6,7. Column's missing for column 1 are 2,6,7,9? Wait, column 1's existing numbers are 3,8,1,5,4. So missing in column 1 are 2,6,7,9. So the possible numbers for (1,1) must be in both row's missing and column's missing. So intersection of {3,5,6,7} and {2,6,7,9} is 6,7. So possible 6 or 7. Let's see if there's another constraint. The 3x3 block for (1,1) is the top-left block. Let's check existing numbers in that block. The top-left block includes rows 1-3, columns 1-3. Existing numbers: row1 has 8,4; row2 has 2,5; row3 has 3,1. So existing numbers are 8,4,2,5,3,1. Missing are 6,7,9. So the cell (1,1) must be one of 6,7,9. But from earlier, the possible numbers are 6 and 7. So 6 or 7. Hmm. Maybe I can't determine this yet. Let's look for cells that have only one possibility.\n\nLooking at row 3: [3, 1, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6, 8, 4]. The third row's third cell is 0. Let's check possible numbers. The row has 3,1,9,6,8,4. Missing are 2,5,7. Column 3: existing numbers in column 3 are row1:4, row2:5, row3:0 (current cell), row4:3, row5:9, row6:0, row7:8, row8:2, row9:1. So column 3 has 4,5,3,9,8,2,1. Missing are 6,7. Wait, but the row's missing are 2,5,7. So intersection is only 7. So the cell (3,3) must be 7. Let me check that. Yes, because column 3 is missing 6 and 7, but row's missing numbers include 7. So 7 is the only possible. So fill in 7 there. Now row3 becomes [3,1,7,9,...]. \n\nNow, let's check the block for that cell (rows 1-3, columns 1-3). Now, with row3, column3 being 7, the missing numbers in that block are 6 and 9. Because existing numbers are 3,1,7,8,4,2,5. So 6 and 9. For cell (1,1), which is in this block, possible numbers are 6 or 9. But earlier, from column 1's missing numbers (2,6,7,9) and row's missing (3,5,6,7). Wait, after filling in 7 in row3, column3, the block's missing are 6 and 9. So cell (1,1) must be 6 or 9. But column 1's missing numbers are 2,6,7,9. Wait, but in column 1, we already have 3,8,1,5,4. So possible numbers for column 1 are 2,6,7,9. But the block allows 6 or 9. So cell (1,1) can be 6 or 9. Let's see if there's another way. Maybe look elsewhere for easier cells.\n\nLooking at row 8: [0, 9, 2, 5, 0, 8, 0, 3, 1]. The fifth column (row8, column5) is 0. Let's check column5. Column5 has existing numbers: row1:1, row2:0, row3:0, row4:7, row5:5, row6:4, row7:3, row8:0, row9:9. Wait, existing numbers are 1,7,5,4,3,9. Missing are 2,6,8. The row's missing numbers are 4, 6, 7? Wait, row8 has [0,9,2,5,0,8,0,3,1]. So existing numbers are 9,2,5,8,3,1. Missing are 4,6,7. So for cell (8,5), column5 missing are 2,6,8. The row's missing are 4,6,7. The intersection is 6. So cell (8,5) must be 6. So fill in 6 there. Now row8 becomes [0,9,2,5,6,8,0,3,1]. \n\nNow, column5 has 6 added. Let me check if that helps other cells. For example, looking at row2's column5. Row2 is [0,2,5,6,0,0,0,1,0]. Column5 for row2 is column5, row2. Column5 now has 1, (row2: ?), 7,5,4,3,6,9. So existing numbers are 1,7,5,4,3,6,9. Missing are 2,8. So row2's column5 can be 2 or 8. Let's check row2's missing numbers. Row2 is [0,2,5,6,?, ?, ?, 1, ?]. The existing numbers are 2,5,6,1. Missing are 3,4,7,8,9. Wait, but column5 allows only 2 or 8. But row2's missing numbers include 8. So cell (2,5) must be 8? Because 2 is already in the row (row2 has 2 in column2). So cell (2,5) can't be 2. Therefore, it must be 8. So fill in 8 there. Now row2 becomes [0,2,5,6,8,0,0,1,0]. \n\nNow, column5 has 8 added. Let me check other cells. For example, row3's column5. Row3 is [3,1,7,9,0,0,6,8,4]. Column5 for row3 is missing. Let's check column5's existing numbers now. After adding 8 in row2, column5 has 1,8,7,5,4,3,6,9. Missing is 2. So row3's column5 must be 2. Because column5's missing is only 2. So fill in 2 in row3, column5. Now row3 becomes [3,1,7,9,2,0,6,8,4]. Now, the sixth column (row3, column6) is 0. Let's check. Row3's existing numbers are 3,1,7,9,2,6,8,4. Missing is 5. So cell (3,6) must be 5. Fill that in. Now row3 is [3,1,7,9,2,5,6,8,4].\n\nNow, looking at the third row's block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Let me check if that helps. For example, row1's column4 and column6. Let's look back at row1: [0,8,4,0,1,0,9,2,0]. Now, column4 for row1 is 0. Column4's existing numbers: let's check. Column4 includes row1:0, row2:6, row3:9, row4:0, row5:0, row6:8, row7:0, row8:5, row9:0. So existing are 6,9,8,5. Missing are 1,2,3,4,7. But row1's column4 is in row1, so row1's existing numbers are 8,4,1,9,2. So missing in row1 are 3,5,6,7. Wait, but column4's missing are 1,2,3,4,7. The intersection for cell (1,4) is possible numbers 3,7. Let's check the block. The block for row1, column4 is the top-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Existing numbers in that block: row1's columns 4-6: 0,1,0; row2's columns 4-6: 6,8,0; row3's columns 4-6: 9,2,5. Existing numbers are 1,6,8,9,2,5. Missing are 3,4,7. So cell (1,4) must be 3,4, or 7. But from earlier, row and column constraints give 3 or 7. So possible 3 or 7. Let me see if there's another cell in this block that can be filled. \n\nLooking at row1's column6. Row1's column6 is 0. The block's missing are 3,4,7. Column6's existing numbers: row1:0, row2:0, row3:5, row4:9, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:8, row9:2. So existing in column6 are 5,9,8,2. Missing are 1,3,4,6,7. Row1's column6 is part of row1 which has existing numbers 8,4,1,9,2. Missing are 3,5,6,7. So possible numbers for (1,6) are 3,5,6,7. But column6 allows 1,3,4,6,7. So intersection is 3,6,7. Also, block allows 3,4,7. So possible numbers for (1,6) are 3,7. \n\nHmm. Maybe I can find another cell. Let's check row4: [8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 6]. Let's look at column2 for row4 (cell (4,2)). Column2's existing numbers: row1:8, row2:2, row3:1, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:9, row9:3. So existing are 8,2,1,9,3. Missing are 4,5,6,7. Row4's existing numbers are 8,3,7,9,6. Missing are 1,2,4,5. Wait, no. Wait row4's current numbers are [8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 6]. So existing numbers are 8,3,7,9,6. Missing in row4 are 1,2,4,5. But column2 allows 4,5,6,7. So intersection is 4,5. So cell (4,2) must be 4 or 5. Let's check the block. Row4 is in the middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). Existing numbers in that block: row4:8,0,3; row5:1,0,9; row6:0,0,0. Let me check existing numbers. From row4: 8,3; row5:1,9; row6: nothing yet. Also, column2 for row4 is in this block. Existing numbers in the block are 8,3,1,9. Missing are 2,4,5,6,7. But cell (4,2) is in this block. So possible numbers are 4,5 (from earlier). Let me see if there are other constraints. \n\nAlternatively, maybe check row4's column7 (cell (4,7)) which is 0. Column7's existing numbers: row1:9, row2:0, row3:6, row4:0, row5:0, row6:1, row7:7, row8:0, row9:5. So existing are 9,6,1,7,5. Missing are 2,3,4,8. Row4's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. Wait, row4's existing numbers are 8,3,7,9,6. Missing are 1,2,4,5. So for cell (4,7), possible numbers are intersection of row's missing (1,2,4,5) and column's missing (2,3,4,8). So possible 2,4. Let me check the block. The middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3) isn't directly related to column7. Wait, cell (4,7) is in the middle-right block (rows 4-6, columns 7-9). Let me check that block. Existing numbers in that block: row4's column7-9: 0,0,6; row5: 0,0,3; row6:1,7,9. So existing are 6,3,1,7,9. Missing are 2,4,5,8. So possible numbers for cell (4,7) are 2,4 (from earlier) and must be in the block's missing. So 2 or 4. Not sure yet. \n\nMaybe another cell. Let's look at row7: [5, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2]. Let's check column2 (row7, column2). Column2's existing numbers are 8,2,1, row4: ?, row5: ?, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8:9, row9:3. So existing are 8,2,1,9,3. Missing are 4,5,6,7. Row7's existing numbers are 5,8,3,7,9,2. Missing are 1,4,6. So possible numbers for (7,2) are intersection of missing in row (1,4,6) and column (4,5,6,7). So possible 4,6. Let's check the block. Row7 is in the bottom-left block (rows 7-9, columns 1-3). Existing numbers: row7:5, ?, 8; row8:0,9,2; row9:4,3,1. Existing numbers are 5,8,9,2,4,3,1. Missing are 6,7. So cell (7,2) is in this block. The possible numbers are 4,6 (from earlier), but the block's missing are 6 and 7. So only 6 is possible. Therefore, cell (7,2) must be 6. Fill that in. Now row7 becomes [5, 6, 8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2]. \n\nNow column2 has a 6 added. Let's check if that helps. For example, row4's column2 (cell (4,2)) which was 4 or 5. Now column2 has 6 in row7. So column2's missing are 4,5,7. Wait, existing numbers in column2 are 8,2,1,6,9,3. So missing are 4,5,7. So row4's cell (4,2) can only be 4 or 5 (since earlier possible were 4,5). Let me check the block again. The middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). Existing numbers: row4:8, ?,3; row5:1, ?,9; row6: ?, ?, ?. Existing numbers are 8,3,1,9. Missing are 2,4,5,6,7. But cell (4,2) is in this block. Possible numbers are 4,5. Let me see if there's another constraint. For example, row4's other cells. \n\nAlternatively, check row5: [1, 0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3]. Let's look at column2 (row5, column2). Column2's missing are 4,5,7. Row5's existing numbers are 1,9,5,3. Missing are 2,4,6,7,8. So possible numbers for cell (5,2) are intersection of column's missing (4,5,7) and row's missing (2,4,6,7,8). So 4,7. Let's check the block. Middle-left block. Possible numbers for cell (5,2) are 4,7. Also, the block's missing are 2,4,5,6,7. Let me see if there's a way to narrow this down. \n\nAlternatively, maybe look at row6: [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 1, 7, 9]. Let's check column1 for row6 (cell (6,1)). Column1's existing numbers: row1: ?, row2: ?, row3:3, row4:8, row5:1, row6: ?, row7:5, row8: ?, row9:4. Existing are 3,8,1,5,4. Missing are 2,6,7,9. Row6's existing numbers are 8,4,1,7,9. Missing are 2,3,5,6. So possible numbers for cell (6,1) are intersection of column's missing (2,6,7,9) and row's missing (2,3,5,6). So 2,6. Let's check the block. Row6 is in the middle-left block. Existing numbers in block: 8,3,1,9, and now cell (6,1) is in this block. Possible numbers 2,6. Let me check if there's another cell in the block that can be filled. For example, cell (6,2) or (6,3). \n\nAlternatively, maybe check row9's column4. Row9 is [4, 3, 1, 0, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8]. Column4 for row9 is 0. Column4's existing numbers: row1: ?, row2:6, row3:9, row4: ?, row5: ?, row6:8, row7: ?, row8:5, row9: ?. Existing are 6,9,8,5. Missing are 1,2,3,4,7. Row9's existing numbers are 4,3,1,9,2,5,6,8. Missing is 7. So cell (9,4) must be 7. Fill that in. Now row9 becomes [4,3,1,7,9,2,5,6,8]. \n\nNow column4 has 7 added. Let's check column4's existing numbers: 6,9,8,5,7. Missing are 1,2,3,4. Let me check if that helps. For example, row1's column4 (cell (1,4)). Possible numbers were 3,7. Now 7 is in column4 (row9), so cell (1,4) can't be 7. So it must be 3. So fill in 3. Now row1 becomes [0,8,4,3,1,0,9,2,0]. \n\nNow, column4 has 3 added. Let me check other cells. For example, row4's column4 (cell (4,4)) is 0. Column4's existing numbers are 3,6,9,8,5,7. Missing are 1,2,4. Row4's existing numbers are 8,0,3,0,7,9,0,0,6. So row4's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. Wait, row4's current numbers are [8, ?, 3, ?, 7, 9, ?, ?, 6]. Existing numbers are 8,3,7,9,6. Missing are 1,2,4,5. So for cell (4,4), column4 allows 1,2,4. So possible numbers are 1,2,4. Let me check the block. Middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3) isn't directly related. Wait, cell (4,4) is in the middle-middle block (rows 4-6, columns 4-6). Let's check that block. Existing numbers: row4's columns 4-6: 0,7,9; row5's columns 4-6: 0,5,0; row6's columns 4-6: 8,4,0. Existing numbers are 7,9,5,8,4. Missing are 1,2,3,6. So cell (4,4) must be in column's missing (1,2,4) and block's missing (1,2,3,6). Intersection is 1,2. So possible 1 or 2. Let me see if there's another way. \n\nLooking back at row1's column6. Row1 is [0,8,4,3,1,0,9,2,0]. Missing numbers in row1 are 5,6,7. Because existing are 8,4,3,1,9,2. So missing are 5,6,7. Column6's existing numbers: row1:0, row2:0, row3:5, row4:9, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:8, row9:2. Existing are 5,9,8,2. Missing are 1,3,4,6,7. So possible numbers for cell (1,6) are intersection of row's missing (5,6,7) and column's missing (1,3,4,6,7). So 6,7. Also, block for cell (1,6) is top-middle (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Existing numbers are 3,1, (row1's column4 and 5), row2's 6,8,0; row3's 9,2,5. Existing numbers are 3,1,6,8,9,2,5. Missing are 4,7. So cell (1,6) must be 4 or 7. But earlier, possible numbers were 6,7. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Wait, the block's missing are 4 and 7. But row's missing are 5,6,7. So the cell (1,6) must be in both. The intersection is 7. So it must be 7. Therefore, fill in 7 there. Now row1 becomes [0,8,4,3,1,7,9,2,0]. \n\nNow, column6 has 7 added. Let's check column6's existing numbers: 5,9,8,2,7. Missing are 1,3,4,6. \n\nNow, row1's last cell (cell (1,9)) is 0. Row1's missing numbers are 5,6. Because existing numbers are 8,4,3,1,7,9,2. So missing are 5,6. Column9's existing numbers: row1:0, row2:0, row3:4, row4:6, row5:3, row6:9, row7:2, row8:1, row9:8. Existing are 4,6,3,9,2,1,8. Missing are 5,7. So for cell (1,9), possible numbers are 5 and 6 (from row) and column allows 5,7. So intersection is 5. Therefore, cell (1,9) must be 5. Fill that in. Now row1 becomes [0,8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5]. \n\nNow, the only missing number in row1 is the first cell (cell (1,1)). Row1's existing numbers are 8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5. Missing is 6. So cell (1,1) is 6. Fill that in. Now row1 is [6,8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5]. \n\nNow, column1 has 6 added. Let's check column1's existing numbers: row1:6, row2: ?, row3:3, row4:8, row5:1, row6: ?, row7:5, row8: ?, row9:4. Existing are 6,3,8,1,5,4. Missing are 2,7,9. \n\nLet's look at row2's first cell (cell (2,1)). Row2 is [0,2,5,6,8,0,0,1,0]. Missing numbers in row2: existing are 2,5,6,8,1. Missing are 3,4,7,9. Column1 allows 2,7,9. So possible numbers are 7,9. Let's check the block. Row2 is in the top-left block (rows 1-3, columns 1-3). Existing numbers are 6,8,4 (row1), 0,2,5 (row2), 3,1,7 (row3). Existing are 6,8,4,2,5,3,1,7. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (2,1) must be 9. Fill that in. Now row2 becomes [9,2,5,6,8,0,0,1,0]. \n\nNow, column1 has 9 added. Missing in column1 are 2,7. \n\nNow, row2's missing numbers are 3,4,7 (since existing are 9,2,5,6,8,1). Let's check cell (2,6) and (2,7) and (2,9). \n\nLooking at row2's column6 (cell (2,6)): column6's existing numbers include 7,5,9,8,2. Missing are 1,3,4,6. Row2's missing numbers are 3,4,7. So possible numbers for (2,6) are 3,4. Let me check the block. Row2's block is top-middle (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). Existing numbers are 3,1,7 (row1's columns 4-6), 6,8,0 (row2's columns 4-6: 6,8,0), and row3's 9,2,5. Existing are 3,1,7,6,8,9,2,5. Missing is 4. Therefore, cell (2,6) must be 4. Fill that in. Now row2 becomes [9,2,5,6,8,4,0,1,0]. \n\nNow, column6 has 4 added. \n\nNow, row2's missing numbers are 3,7. The remaining empty cells are (2,7) and (2,9). Let's check cell (2,7): column7's existing numbers are 9 (row1), 0 (row2), 6 (row3), 0 (row4), 0 (row5), 1 (row6), 7 (row7), 0 (row8), 5 (row9). Existing are 9,6,1,7,5. Missing are 2,3,4,8. Row2's missing are 3,7. So possible for (2,7): 3. Because column7 allows 2,3,4,8, but row's missing is 3,7. So only 3 is possible. Fill in 3. Now row2 becomes [9,2,5,6,8,4,3,1,0]. \n\nNow, the last cell in row2 is (2,9). Row2's missing is 7. Fill that in. Now row2 is [9,2,5,6,8,4,3,1,7]. \n\nNow, column9's existing numbers: row1:5, row2:7, row3:4, row4:6, row5:3, row6:9, row7:2, row8:1, row9:8. All filled except maybe others. \n\nNow, let's look at row4: [8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 6]. Let's check cell (4,2). Column2's existing numbers: 8 (row1), 2 (row2), 1 (row3), row4: ?, 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 9 (row8), 3 (row9). Existing are 8,2,1,6,9,3. Missing are 4,5,7. Row4's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. Wait, row4's current numbers are [8, ?, 3, ?, 7, 9, ?, ?, 6]. Existing are 8,3,7,9,6. Missing are 1,2,4,5. So possible for (4,2) are 4,5 (since column allows 4,5,7 and row allows 1,2,4,5). Intersection is 4,5. Let me check the block. Middle-left block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3). Existing numbers are row4:8, ?, 3; row5:1, ?, 9; row6: ?, ?, ?. Existing numbers are 8,3,1,9. Missing are 2,4,5,6,7. So cell (4,2) can be 4 or 5. Let's check other cells in the row. \n\nLooking at row4's column4 (cell (4,4)), which is 0. Column4's existing numbers are 3 (row1), 6 (row2), 9 (row3), ?, 5 (row8), 7 (row9). Existing are 3,6,9,5,7. Missing are 1,2,4,8. Row4's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. So for cell (4,4), possible numbers are intersection of column's missing (1,2,4,8) and row's missing (1,2,4,5). So 1,2,4. Also, block middle-middle (rows 4-6, columns 4-6). Existing numbers: row4's columns 4-6: 0,7,9; row5's columns 4-6: 0,5,0; row6's columns 4-6: 8,4,0. Existing numbers are 7,9,5,8,4. Missing are 1,2,3,6. So cell (4,4) must be 1,2. Because from earlier, possible 1,2,4 but block allows 1,2. So possible 1 or 2. \n\nLet me see if there's another way. Maybe look at row4's column7 (cell (4,7)) which is 0. Column7's existing numbers: row1:9, row2:3, row3:6, row4:0, row5:0, row6:1, row7:7, row8:0, row9:5. Existing are 9,3,6,1,7,5. Missing are 2,4,8. Row4's missing are 1,2,4,5. So possible numbers for (4,7) are 2,4. Let me check the block middle-right (rows 4-6, columns 7-9). Existing numbers: row4's 0, 0, 6; row5's 0, 0, 3; row6's 1,7,9. Existing are 6,3,1,7,9. Missing are 2,4,5,8. So possible numbers for (4,7) are 2,4. \n\nNot sure yet. Let's check row5: [1, 0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3]. Let's look at cell (5,2). Column2's missing are 4,5,7. Row5's missing are 2,4,6,7,8. Possible numbers are 4,7. Let me check the block middle-left. If cell (5,2) is 4 or 7. \n\nAlternatively, check row6: [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 1, 7, 9]. Let's look at cell (6,1). Column1's missing are 2,7. Row6's missing are 2,3,5,6. So possible numbers for (6,1) are 2. Because column allows 2,7 and row allows 2. So cell (6,1) must be 2. Fill that in. Now row6 becomes [2, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 1, 7, 9]. \n\nNow, column1 has 2 added. Missing in column1 are 7. \n\nNow, row6's missing numbers are 3,5,6. Let's check cell (6,2) and (6,3). \n\nLooking at cell (6,2): column2's missing are 4,5,7. Row6's missing are 3,5,6. Intersection is 5. So cell (6,2) must be 5. Fill that in. Now row6 becomes [2,5, 0, 8, 4, 0, 1, 7, 9]. \n\nNow, column2 has 5 added. Now, column2's existing numbers are 8,2,1,5,6,9,3. Missing are 4,7. \n\nNow, row6's missing numbers are 3,6. Let's look at cell (6,3). Column3's existing numbers: row1:4, row2:5, row3:7, row4:3, row5:9, row6:0, row7:8, row8:2, row9:1. Existing are 4,5,7,3,9,8,2,1. Missing are 6. So cell (6,3) must be 6. Fill that in. Now row6 becomes [2,5,6,8,4,0,1,7,9]. \n\nNow, row6's missing is cell (6,6). Row6's existing numbers are 2,5,6,8,4,1,7,9. Missing is 3. So fill in 3. Now row6 is [2,5,6,8,4,3,1,7,9]. \n\nNow, column6 has 3 added. \n\nNow, back to row4: [8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 6]. Let's look at cell (4,2). Column2's missing are 4,7. Row4's missing numbers are 1,2,4,5. But column allows 4,7. So possible numbers are 4. Because 7 is not in row's missing (row4's missing are 1,2,4,5). So cell (4,2) must be 4. Fill that in. Now row4 becomes [8,4,3,0,7,9,0,0,6]. \n\nNow, row4's missing numbers are 1,2,5. Let's check cell (4,4). Column4's existing numbers are 3,6,9,5,7. Missing are 1,2,4,8. Row4's missing are 1,2,5. So possible numbers are 1,2. Also, block middle-middle (rows 4-6, columns 4-6). Existing numbers are row4: ?,7,9; row5: ?,5,?; row6:8,4,3. Existing are 7,9,5,8,4,3. Missing are 1,2,6. So cell (4,4) must be 1 or 2. \n\nLooking at row4's column4. Let's check row4's other cells. For example, cell (4,7) and (4,8). \n\nRow4's column7 is 0. Column7's existing numbers are 9,3,6,1,7,5. Missing are 2,4,8. Row4's missing are 1,2,5. So possible numbers for (4,7) are 2. Because column allows 2,4,8 and row allows 2. So fill in 2. Now row4 becomes [8,4,3,0,7,9,2,0,6]. \n\nNow, column7 has 2 added. \n\nNow, row4's missing numbers are 1,5. Let's look at cell (4,4) and (4,8). \n\nFor cell (4,4): possible 1 or 2. But row4's missing now are 1,5. So cell (4,4) must be 1. Fill that in. Now row4 becomes [8,4,3,1,7,9,2,0,6]. \n\nNow, column4 has 1 added. \n\nNow, row4's last missing cell is (4,8). Row4's missing is 5. Fill that in. Now row4 is [8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5,6]. \n\nNow, column8's existing numbers: row1:2, row2:1, row3:8, row4:5, row5: ?, row6:7, row7:9, row8:3, row9:6. Existing are 2,1,8,5,7,9,3,6. Missing is 4. \n\nLooking at row5: [1, 0, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3]. Let's check cell (5,2). Column2's missing are 4,7. Row5's existing numbers are 1,9,5,3. Missing are 2,4,6,7,8. So possible numbers for (5,2) are 4,7. Let me check the block middle-left. Existing numbers in the block (rows 4-6, columns 1-3): row4:8,4,3; row5:1, ?,9; row6:2,5,6. Existing are 8,4,3,1,9,2,5,6. Missing is 7. So cell (5,2) must be 7. Fill that in. Now row5 becomes [1,7,9,0,5,0,0,0,3]. \n\nNow, column2 has 7 added. \n\nNow, row5's missing numbers are 2,4,6,8. Let's look at cell (5,4). Column4's existing numbers are 3,6,9,1,5,7,8. Missing are 2,4. Row5's missing are 2,4,6,8. So possible numbers for (5,4) are 2,4. Let's check the block middle-middle. Existing numbers are row4:1,7,9; row5: ?,5,?; row6:8,4,3. Existing are 1,7,9,5,8,4,3. Missing are 2,6. So cell (5,4) must be 2. Fill that in. Now row5 becomes [1,7,9,2,5,0,0,0,3]. \n\nNow, column4 has 2 added. \n\nNow, row5's missing numbers are 4,6,8. Let's check cell (5,6). Column6's existing numbers are 7,4,5,9,3,8,2. Missing are 1,6. Wait, column6's existing numbers: row1:7, row2:4, row3:5, row4:9, row5: ?, row6:3, row7: ?, row8:8, row9:2. Existing are 7,4,5,9,3,8,2. Missing are 1,6. Row5's missing are 4,6,8. So possible numbers for (5,6) are 6 (since column allows 1,6 and row allows 6). Fill in 6. Now row5 becomes [1,7,9,2,5,6,0,0,3]. \n\nNow, column6 has 6 added. \n\nNow, row5's missing numbers are 4,8. Let's look at cells (5,7) and (5,8). \n\nFor cell (5,7): column7's existing numbers are 9,3,6,2,1,7,5. Missing are 4,8. Row5's missing are 4,8. So possible numbers are 4,8. Let's check the block middle-right (rows 4-6, columns 7-9). Existing numbers are row4:2,5,6; row5: ?, ?, 3; row6:1,7,9. Existing are 2,5,6,3,1,7,9. Missing are 4,8. So cell (5,7) can be 4 or 8. Let me check row5's other constraints. \n\nLooking at row5's column8 (cell (5,8)): column8's missing is 4 (as earlier). So cell (5,8) must be 4. Fill that in. Now row5 becomes [1,7,9,2,5,6,0,4,3]. \n\nNow, column8 has 4 added. \n\nNow, row5's missing is cell (5,7). Row5's missing is 8. Fill that in. Now row5 is [1,7,9,2,5,6,8,4,3]. \n\nNow, column7 has 8 added. \n\nNow, let's check row7: [5, 6, 8, 0, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2]. Missing numbers are in row7: existing are 5,6,8,3,7,9,2. Missing are 1,4. Let's look at cell (7,4) and (7,6). \n\nColumn4's existing numbers are 3,6,9,1,2,5,7,8. Missing is 4. So cell (7,4) must be 4. Fill that in. Now row7 becomes [5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2]. \n\nNow, row7's missing is cell (7,6). Row7's missing is 1. Fill that in. Now row7 is [5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 1, 7, 9, 2]. \n\nNow, column6 has 1 added. \n\nNow, row8: [0,9,2,5,6,8,0,3,1]. Let's check cell (8,1). Column1's existing numbers are 6,9,3,8,1,2,5,4. Missing is 7. So cell (8,1) must be 7. Fill that in. Now row8 becomes [7,9,2,5,6,8,0,3,1]. \n\nNow, row8's missing is cell (8,7). Column7's existing numbers are 9,3,6,2,8,1,7,5. Missing is 4. Fill in 4. Now row8 is [7,9,2,5,6,8,4,3,1]. \n\nAll rows should now be filled. Let me verify each row, column, and block. \n\nFinal board:\n\nRow1: [6,8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5]\nRow2: [9,2,5,6,8,4,3,1,7]\nRow3: [3,1,7,9,2,5,6,8,4]\nRow4: [8,4,3,1,7,9,2,5,6]\nRow5: [1,7,9,2,5,6,8,4,3]\nRow6: [2,5,6,8,4,3,1,7,9]\nRow7: [5,6,8,4,3,1,7,9,2]\nRow8: [7,9,2,5,6,8,4,3,1]\nRow9: [4,3,1,7,9,2,5,6,8]\n\nChecking rows for duplicates: All rows have unique numbers 1-9. \n\nChecking columns: For example, column1: 6,9,3,8,1,2,5,7,4 → all unique. \n\nChecking blocks: For example, top-left block (rows1-3, cols1-3): 6,8,4; 9,2,5; 3,1,7 → all unique. \n\nLooks good. All constraints satisfied.\n ;Answer: [[6, 8, 4, 3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5], [9, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 1, 7], [3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4], [8, 4, 3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6], [1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 3], [2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 1, 7, 9], [5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 1, 7, 9, 2], [7, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8, 4, 3, 1], [4, 3, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 6, 8]]"

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where the missing numbers go. Each row, column, and 3x3 block must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition. Let me start by scanning the rows, columns, and blocks for obvious placements.\n\nLooking at the first row: [3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 7, 5]. Missing numbers here are 1, 2, 4, 8. Let's check the columns for each empty cell. The first empty is column 2. Let's see what numbers are already in column 2. Column 2 has existing numbers: 0 (from row 1), 7 (row 2), 9 (row3), 5 (row4), 0 (row5), 4 (row6), 0 (row7), 8 (row8), 0 (row9). Wait, maybe I should list all column entries properly. Maybe better to check each cell step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with cells that have the fewest possibilities. Let's look for cells that can only take one number. Let's check row 3, column 9 (third row last cell). The current row is [8,9,2,0,7,5,3,1,0]. The missing numbers in the row are 4,6. But looking at column 9, existing numbers are 5 (row1), 2 (row2), 0 (row3), 6 (row4), 8 (row5), 3 (row6), 0 (row7), 1 (row8), 7 (row9). So existing in column 9 are 5,2,6,8,3,1,7. Missing are 4 and 9. But the row's missing numbers are 4 and 6. Wait, the row is [8,9,2,0,7,5,3,1,0]. The existing numbers are 8,9,2,7,5,3,1. So missing are 4,6. So the cell in row3, column9 must be 4 or 6. But column9 has existing 5,2,6 (from row4's column9 is 6?), wait original row4 is [0,5,3,0,4,8,0,2,6], so column9 for row4 is 6. Therefore, column9 already has 6. Therefore, the missing in column9 for row3's cell can't be 6. So it must be 4. Therefore, row3, column9 is 4. So updating row3 to [8,9,2,0,7,5,3,1,4].\n\nNow row3's missing number in column4. The row is now [8,9,2,0,7,5,3,1,4]. Missing in the row is 6. Because existing numbers are 8,9,2,7,5,3,1,4. Missing is 6. Therefore, column4 (fourth column) in row3 must be 6. Let me check the column and block. Column4: existing numbers in column4 are row1:0, row2:3, row3: now 6 (if we put it there), row4:0, row5:7, row6:9, row7:0, row8:2, row9:0. Wait, the original column4 entries are:\n\nRow1: column4 is 0\n\nRow2: column4 is 3\n\nRow3: column4 is 0 (but we just determined it's 6)\n\nRow4: column4 is 0\n\nRow5: column4 is 7\n\nRow6: column4 is 9\n\nRow7: column4 is 0\n\nRow8: column4 is 2\n\nRow9: column4 is 0\n\nSo if we put 6 in row3, column4, that's okay as column4 doesn't have 6 yet. Also, check the 3x3 block. Row3 is in the top-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6). The block includes row3, column4. Let's check existing numbers in that block. The block (columns 4-6 for rows 1-3):\n\nRow1: columns4-6: 0,9,0\n\nRow2: columns4-6: 3,1,4\n\nRow3: columns4-6: 6,7,5\n\nSo existing numbers are 3,1,4,6,7,5,9. Missing are 2,8. Wait, but row3's column4 is 6, which is allowed. Wait, row3's column4 is 6, which is not conflicting with the existing numbers in the block. So that's okay.\n\nSo now row3 is [8,9,2,6,7,5,3,1,4].\n\nMoving on. Let's check other cells. Let's look at row7, column9. Original row7 is [2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 0]. Now, after previous changes, let's check row7's column9. The row's existing numbers are 2, ?, 7, ?, 3, 1, 4, ?, ?. Let's see what's missing. The row needs numbers 1-9. Existing in row7: 2,7,3,1,4. Missing are 5,6,8,9. Column9: existing numbers are 5 (row1), 2 (row2), 4 (row3), 6 (row4), 8 (row5?), let me check again. Original column9 entries:\n\nRow1:5\n\nRow2:2\n\nRow3:4 (after correction)\n\nRow4:6\n\nRow5:8?\n\nOriginal row5 is [0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 1, 0, 8]. So column9 for row5 is 8. So column9 has 5,2,4,6,8. Also, row6's column9 is 3. Row7's column9 is 0. So column9 missing are 1,7,9? Wait, existing numbers in column9 are 5,2,4,6,8,3 (from row6), and row7's column9 is 0. Also, row8's column9 is 1. So column9 has 5,2,4,6,8,3,1. Missing are 7 and 9. So row7's column9 can be 7 or 9. But row7's missing numbers are 5,6,8,9? Wait, original row7 is [2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 0]. Let me list existing numbers in row7:\n\nNumbers present: 2,7,3,1,4. So missing are 5,6,8,9. So for column9, possible 7 or 9, but row7's missing numbers include 9. So column9's cell must be 9. Because 7 is not in row7's missing numbers (since 7 is already present in row7). Therefore, row7, column9 is 9. Then, the other missing cell in row7's column9's column is row9's column9? Not sure yet. Let's update row7's column9 to 9. Now, row7 becomes [2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 1, 4, 0, 9]. Now, the remaining missing in row7 is 5,6,8 in columns 2,4,8.\n\nLet me check column8 for row7's column8 (which is 0). Column8 entries are:\n\nRow1:7\n\nRow2:9\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:0 (now)\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:6.\n\nSo column8 has 7,9,1,2,6. Missing are 3,4,5,8. But row7's missing numbers are 5,6,8. Wait, row7's missing numbers are 5,6,8. But column8's missing for row7's cell is in column8. So the possible numbers for row7, column8 are 5,8? Because column8's existing numbers are 7,9,1,2,6. So possible 3,4,5,8. But row7's missing are 5,6,8. So overlapping is 5 and 8. Therefore, possible 5 or 8. Let me check the block. Row7 is in the bottom-left block (rows 7-9, columns 1-3?), no. Wait, row7's column8 is in columns 7-9? No, column8 is part of columns 7-9? Wait, columns are 1-9. The blocks are divided into 3 columns of 3x3. Column8 is in the middle block of columns (columns 7-9?), no. Let me clarify. The blocks are:\n\nColumns 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 for each row group. So row7 is in the bottom block (rows 7-9). Column8 is in the third column block (columns 7-9). So the block for row7, column8 is the block covering rows 7-9 and columns 7-9. Let's look at existing numbers in that block. The cells in this block are:\n\nRow7, columns7-9: 4, 0, 9 (since we updated row7's column9 to 9)\n\nRow8, columns7-9: 0, 0, 1 (original row8: [0,8,9,2,0,0,0,0,1])\n\nRow9, columns7-9: 2,6,7.\n\nSo existing numbers in this block are 4,9,1,2,6,7. Missing are 3,5,8. So row7, column8's cell is in this block. Possible numbers are 3,5,8. But earlier possibilities for row7's column8 were 5 or 8. So combining, possible 5 or 8. Let's see if there's another constraint. Let's check column8 again. Column8's existing numbers are 7,9,1,2,6. So for row7's column8, possible 5 or 8. Let's see if there's another cell in the same row or column that can help. Let's check row7's other missing numbers. The row has [2, 0, 7, 0, 3, 1, 4, ?, 9]. The missing numbers are 5,6,8. The other missing cells are column2 (0), column4 (0), and column8 (the one we're looking at). Let me check column2. Column2 entries:\n\nRow1:0 (original row1's column2 is 0)\n\nRow2:7\n\nRow3:9\n\nRow4:5\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:4\n\nRow7:0 (current)\n\nRow8:8\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo column2 has 7,9,5,4,8. Missing are 1,2,3,6. But row7's column2 is part of row7 which already has 2. So possible numbers for column2 (row7) are 1,3,6. But row7's missing numbers are 5,6,8. So overlapping is 6. Therefore, row7's column2 must be 6. Because it's the only common number. So row7, column2 is 6. Now, row7 becomes [2,6,7, 0, 3, 1, 4, ?, 9]. Now, missing numbers in row7 are 5 and 8 (since 6 was filled in). Now, column2's row7 is 6. Let me check if that's allowed. Column2 now has 6 added. Column2's existing numbers are 7,9,5,4,8,6. No duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, row7's missing cells are column4 (0) and column8 (0). The missing numbers are 5 and 8. Let's look at column4 for row7. Column4 entries:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:7\n\nRow6:9\n\nRow7:0 (current)\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo existing in column4 are 3,6,7,9,2. Missing are 1,4,5,8. For row7's column4, possible numbers are 5 or 8 (since row7's missing are 5 and 8). Let me check the block. The block for row7, column4 is the bottom-middle block (rows7-9, columns4-6). Let's check existing numbers in that block. Columns4-6 for rows7-9:\n\nRow7: column4 is 0, column5 is 3, column6 is 1.\n\nRow8: column4 is 2, column5 is 0, column6 is 0.\n\nRow9: column4 is 0, column5 is 8, column6 is 0.\n\nExisting numbers in this block are 3,1,2,8. Missing are 4,5,6,7,9. But row7's column4 can be 5 or 8. But 8 is already in the block (row9's column5 is 8). So row7's column4 can't be 8. Therefore, it must be 5. So row7, column4 is 5. Now, row7 becomes [2,6,7,5,3,1,4, ?, 9]. Now, the remaining missing number in row7 is 8 in column8. So column8's cell is 8. Let's check column8. Column8's existing numbers are 7,9,1,2,6,8 (now added). So adding 8 here is okay. Also, the block for column8 (rows7-9, columns7-9) already has 4, ?,9 (now 8 in column8). So adding 8 is okay. So row7's column8 is 8. Now, row7 is [2,6,7,5,3,1,4,8,9].\n\nGreat progress on row7. Let's move to other areas. Let's check row9: [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 6, 7]. Missing numbers in row9 are 1,3,4,9. Let's look for possible placements. Let's check column2 for row9. Column2 entries: existing are 0 (row1),7 (row2),9 (row3),5 (row4),0 (row5),4 (row6),6 (row7),8 (row8),0 (row9). So column2 has 7,9,5,4,6,8. Missing are 1,2,3. But row9's column2 is part of row9 which already has 5, so possible numbers are 1,3. Because row9's missing numbers are 1,3,4,9. So column2 for row9 can be 1 or 3. Let's check the block. Row9 is in the bottom-left block (rows7-9, columns1-3). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow7: 2,6,7\n\nRow8: 0,8,9\n\nRow9: 5, ?, ?.\n\nExisting numbers: 2,6,7,8,9,5. Missing are 1,3,4. So row9's column2 can be 1,3. Let's see if there's another constraint. Let's check column2. For row9, column2 is 0. Let me look for other cells in column2 that might help. For example, row1's column2 is 0. Maybe we can find something else first.\n\nLooking at row1: [3, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6, 7, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,2,4,8. Let's check column2 for row1. Column2 has existing numbers: 7,9,5,4,6,8. Missing are 1,2,3. So row1's column2 can be 1,2. Because row1's missing numbers are 1,2,4,8. So possible 1 or 2. Let's check the block. Row1 is in the top-left block (rows1-3, columns1-3). Existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow1: 3, ?, ?\n\nRow2: 0,7, ?\n\nRow3: 8,9,2.\n\nExisting numbers: 3,7,8,9,2. Missing are 1,4,5,6. Wait, but row1's column2 is part of this block. Possible numbers for row1's column2 are 1 or 2. But the block's missing numbers include 1, but not 2? Wait, existing numbers in the block are 3,7,8,9,2 (from row3's column3). Wait row3's columns1-3 are 8,9,2. So the block (rows1-3, columns1-3) has 3 (row1), 8 (row3), 9 (row3), 2 (row3). Also, row2's column1 is 0, column2 is 7, column3 is 0. So existing numbers are 3,7,8,9,2. Missing are 1,4,5,6. Therefore, row1's column2 can't be 2 because 2 is already in the block (row3's column3). Therefore, row1's column2 must be 1. So row1, column2 is 1. Now, row1 becomes [3,1,0,0,9,0,6,7,5]. Now, missing numbers in row1 are 2,4,8. Let's check column3 for row1 (which is 0). Column3 entries:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:8\n\nRow7:7\n\nRow8:9\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers in column3: 2,3,8,7,9. Missing are 1,4,5,6. But row1's missing are 2,4,8. Wait, row1's current missing numbers after adding 1 are 2,4,8. So for column3's row1 cell, possible numbers are 2,4,8. But column3 already has 2 (row3), 8 (row6). So row1's column3 can't be 2 or 8. Therefore, it must be 4. So row1, column3 is 4. Now, row1 becomes [3,1,4,0,9,0,6,7,5]. Missing numbers in row1 are 2 and 8 for the remaining cells (columns4 and 6).\n\nLet's look at column4 for row1 (which is 0). Column4 entries are:\n\nRow1:0\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:7\n\nRow6:9\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers in column4 are 3,6,7,9,5,2. Missing are 1,4,8. Row1's missing numbers are 2 and 8. Wait, row1's missing numbers are 2 and 8? Wait, original row1 after adding 1 and 4 is [3,1,4,0,9,0,6,7,5]. The existing numbers are 3,1,4,9,6,7,5. Missing are 2,8. Therefore, row1's column4 and column6 must be 2 and 8. Let's check column4. For row1's column4, possible numbers are 1,4,8 (from column4's missing). But row1's missing are 2 and 8. So only possible is 8. Therefore, row1's column4 is 8. Then, row1's column6 must be 2. Let me confirm. Column6 entries:\n\nRow1:0 (now 2)\n\nRow2:4\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:6\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0.\n\nSo adding 2 to row1's column6 is okay. Let's check the block for row1's column4 (which is 8). The block is top-left (rows1-3, columns1-3) no, column4 is in columns4-6. So the block for row1, column4 is top-middle block (rows1-3, columns4-6). Existing numbers in that block after adding 8 and 2:\n\nRow1: columns4-6: 8,9,2\n\nRow2: columns4-6:3,1,4\n\nRow3: columns4-6:6,7,5.\n\nSo all numbers 1-9 are present. Good. So row1 is now [3,1,4,8,9,2,6,7,5]. Now, row1 is complete.\n\nNow, let's check row2: [0,7,0,3,1,4,8,9,2]. Missing numbers are 5,6. Let's look at column1 for row2 (which is 0). Column1 entries:\n\nRow1:3\n\nRow2:0\n\nRow3:8\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:2\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:5.\n\nExisting in column1: 3,8,2,5. Missing are 1,4,6,7,9. But row2's missing numbers are 5 and 6. Wait, row2's current row is [0,7,0,3,1,4,8,9,2]. Existing numbers are 7,3,1,4,8,9,2. Missing are 5,6. Therefore, row2's column1 and column3 must be 5 and 6. Let's check column1 for row2. Column1's existing numbers are 3,8,2,5. So row2's column1 can't be 5 (already in column1 from row9). Therefore, row2's column1 must be 6. Then, row2's column3 must be 5. Let me check. Column3 for row2: existing numbers in column3 are 4 (row1), 0 (row2), 2 (row3), 3 (row4), 0 (row5), 8 (row6), 7 (row7), 9 (row8), 0 (row9). Adding 5 is okay. Also, check the block (top-left block for row2's column1 and column3). For column1, row2 is 6. The block (rows1-3, columns1-3) has existing numbers 3 (row1), 6 (row2), 8 (row3), 7 (row2's column2), 9 (row2's column2?), no. Wait row2's columns1-3 are [0,7,0]. Now, if we set column1 to 6 and column3 to 5, then the block's numbers would be 3 (row1), 6 (row2), 8 (row3), 7 (row2's column2), 5 (row2's column3), 9 (row3's column2), 2 (row3's column3). So numbers are 3,6,8,7,5,9,2. Missing are 1,4. But that's okay because the block only needs 1-9. Wait, but the row2's column1 is 6, which is allowed. So row2 becomes [6,7,5,3,1,4,8,9,2]. Now, row2 is complete.\n\nNow, moving to row3, which is already filled except for column4 which was filled earlier as 6. Wait, row3 is [8,9,2,6,7,5,3,1,4]. All filled. So row3 is done.\n\nNow, let's look at row4: [0,5,3,0,4,8,0,2,6]. Missing numbers in row4 are 1,7,9. Let's check each cell. Let's look at column1 (0). Column1 entries: 3,6 (row2), 8, 0 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 2, 0 (row8), 5. Existing in column1: 3,6,8,2,5. Missing are 1,4,7,9. Row4's missing are 1,7,9. So possible for column1: 1,7,9. Let's check the block. Row4 is in the middle-left block (rows4-6, columns1-3). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow4: column1 is 0, column2 is 5, column3 is 3.\n\nRow5: columns1-3: 0,0,0.\n\nRow6: columns1-3: 0,4,8.\n\nExisting numbers: 5,3,4,8. So missing are 1,2,6,7,9. But row4's column1 can be 1,7,9. Let's see if there's another constraint. Let's check column7 for row4 (which is 0). Column7 entries:\n\nRow1:6\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:7\n\nRow7:4\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:2.\n\nExisting numbers: 6,8,3,1,7,4,2. Missing are 5,9. But row4's missing numbers are 1,7,9. So column7 for row4 can be 9 (since 5 is not in row4's missing). Therefore, row4's column7 must be 9. Let me check. If column7 is 9, then row4's missing numbers would be 1 and 7. Let's check if that's possible. Let me see if 9 is allowed in column7. Column7 currently doesn't have 9. Yes. And the block for row4, column7 is middle-right block (rows4-6, columns7-9). Existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow4: columns7-9: 0 (now 9?), 2, 6.\n\nRow5: columns7-9: 1, 0, 8.\n\nRow6: columns7-9:7, 0, 3.\n\nExisting numbers: 9 (if added), 2,6,1,8,7,3. Missing are 4,5. Wait, no. Wait, adding 9 to row4's column7 would make the block have 9. So it's allowed. So yes, row4's column7 is 9. Now, row4 becomes [0,5,3,0,4,8,9,2,6]. Now, missing numbers in row4 are 1 and 7 (since 9 is filled). Let's check column1 and column4. Column1 for row4 is 0. Possible numbers are 1 or 7. Let's check column1's existing numbers again. Column1 has 3,6,8,2,5. So possible 1,7,9. But row4's missing are 1 and 7. So possible 1 or 7. Let me check the block (middle-left block). Existing numbers in this block are 5,3 (row4), 4,8 (row6). Also, row5's columns1-3 are [0,0,0]. So missing numbers in the block are 1,2,6,7,9. But row4's column1 can be 1 or 7. Let's see if there's another way. Let's look at column4 for row4 (which is 0). Column4 entries are:\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:0\n\nRow5:7\n\nRow6:9\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers: 8,3,6,7,9,5,2. Missing are 1,4. Row4's missing numbers are 1 and 7. So for column4's row4 cell, possible is 1. Because column4 is missing 1 and 4, but row4's missing are 1 and 7. Therefore, row4's column4 must be 1. Because 4 is not in row4's missing numbers. Therefore, row4's column4 is 1. Now, row4 becomes [0,5,3,1,4,8,9,2,6]. Now, the missing number in row4 is 7 in column1. So row4's column1 is 7. Let me check column1: existing numbers are 3,6,8,2,5,7. No duplicates. Yes. So row4 is now [7,5,3,1,4,8,9,2,6]. Now, row4 is complete.\n\nNow, row5: [0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Let's check current state. Original row5 is [0, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Let me check what's filled now. Let's look at column1, column2, column3, column6, column8. Let's find missing numbers. Existing numbers in row5 are 7,5,1,8. Missing are 2,3,4,6,9. Let me check each cell:\n\nColumns 1,2,3,6,8 are empty. Let's check column1 for row5 (0). Column1 has existing numbers: 3,6,8,7 (row4), 2 (row7), 5 (row9). Missing are 1,4,9. But row5's missing numbers are 2,3,4,6,9. So possible for column1 is 4 or 9. Let's check the block. Row5 is in the middle-left block (rows4-6, columns1-3). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow4: 7,5,3\n\nRow5: 0,0,0\n\nRow6: 0,4,8.\n\nExisting numbers: 7,5,3,4,8. Missing are 1,2,6,9. So row5's column1 can be 1,2,6,9. But row5's possible for column1 is 4 or 9 (from previous step). Wait, there's a contradiction here. Let me recheck. Column1's existing numbers are 3 (row1), 6 (row2), 8 (row3), 7 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 2 (row7), 0 (row8), 5 (row9). So column1's existing are 3,6,8,7,2,5. Missing are 1,4,9. So row5's column1 can be 1,4,9. But row5's missing numbers are 2,3,4,6,9. So overlapping possible are 4 and 9. Therefore, row5's column1 is either 4 or 9. Let's check the block. Middle-left block's missing numbers are 1,2,6,9. So row5's column1 could be 9 (since it's in the block's missing). Let's see if there's another way. Let's check other cells in row5. For example, column6 (which is 0). Column6 entries:\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:4\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:6\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers: 2,4,5,8,6,1. Missing are 3,7,9. Row5's missing numbers include 3, so possible for column6 is 3. Let me see. If row5's column6 is 3, then let's check if that's possible. Let me check the block for column6. Column6 is in the middle-middle block (rows4-6, columns4-6). Existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow4: columns4-6:1,4,8\n\nRow5: columns4-6:7,5, ?\n\nRow6: columns4-6:9, 0, 6.\n\nExisting numbers are 1,4,8,7,5,9,6. Missing are 2,3. So row5's column6 can be 3. Yes. So if we put 3 in row5, column6, then row5's missing numbers would adjust. Let's try that. So row5's column6 is 3. Now, row5 becomes [0,0,0,7,5,3,1,0,8]. Now, missing numbers in row5 are 2,4,6,9. Let's see if this helps. Now, column6 is filled. Let's check other cells. Let's look at column8 for row5 (which is 0). Column8 entries:\n\nRow1:7\n\nRow2:9\n\nRow3:1\n\nRow4:2\n\nRow5:0\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:8\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:6.\n\nExisting numbers: 7,9,1,2,8,6. Missing are 3,4,5. But row5's missing numbers are 2,4,6,9. Wait, row5's current missing numbers after adding 3 are 2,4,6,9. But column8's missing are 3,4,5. So possible for row5's column8 is 4. Let me check. If row5's column8 is 4, then let's check if that's allowed. Let me check the block for row5's column8 (middle-right block, rows4-6, columns7-9). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow4: columns7-9:9,2,6\n\nRow5: columns7-9:1, 4 (if added), 8\n\nRow6: columns7-9:7, ?, 3.\n\nExisting numbers would be 9,2,6,1,4,8,7,3. Missing is 5. But row5's column8 being 4 is allowed. Also, column8 would have 4 added. So yes. So row5's column8 is 4. Now, row5 becomes [0,0,0,7,5,3,1,4,8]. Missing numbers are 2,6,9 in columns1,2,3.\n\nLet's check column1 for row5 (0). Possible numbers are 1,4,9 (from column1's missing). But row5's missing are 2,6,9. So possible is 9. Therefore, row5's column1 is 9. Let me check block. Middle-left block's missing numbers are 1,2,6. If we put 9 in column1, but the block's missing numbers don't include 9. Wait, this is a contradiction. Wait, the middle-left block (rows4-6, columns1-3) has existing numbers: row4's columns1-3:7,5,3; row5's columns1-3:9, ?, ?; row6's columns1-3: ?,4,8. Existing numbers are 7,5,3,4,8,9. Missing are 1,2,6. But if we put 9 in row5's column1, which is part of this block, but 9 is already present in row5's column1? Wait, no, the existing numbers in the block include 9 now (row5's column1). But the block's existing numbers were previously missing 9? No, the block's existing numbers before adding 9 to row5's column1 are 7,5,3,4,8. Adding 9 is allowed because it wasn't there before. So it's okay. But the block's missing numbers after adding 9 would be 1,2,6. So yes. Therefore, row5's column1 is 9. Now, row5 becomes [9,0,0,7,5,3,1,4,8]. Missing numbers are 2,6 in columns2 and 3. Let's look at column2 for row5 (0). Column2 entries: existing are 1 (row1),7 (row2),9 (row3),5 (row4), ?,4 (row6),6 (row7),8 (row8), ? (row9). So existing are 1,7,9,5,4,6,8. Missing are 2,3. Row5's missing numbers are 2 and 6. So possible for column2 is 2. Therefore, row5's column2 is 2. Now, row5 becomes [9,2,0,7,5,3,1,4,8]. Now, missing number in row5 is 6 in column3. So row5, column3 is 6. Let me check column3. Column3 has existing numbers: 4 (row1),5 (row2),2 (row3),3 (row4),6 (row5),8 (row6),7 (row7),9 (row8), ?. So adding 6 is okay. Also, the block for row5's column3 (middle-left block) has existing numbers 7,5,3,9,2,4,8. Adding 6 is allowed. So row5 is now [9,2,6,7,5,3,1,4,8]. Complete.\n\nNow, moving to row6: [0,4,8,9,0,6,7,0,3]. Missing numbers in row6 are 1,2,5. Let's check each cell. Columns1,5,8 are 0. Let's check column1 for row6. Column1 entries: 3,6,8,7,9, ?,2,0,5. Existing are 3,6,8,7,9,2,5. Missing are 1,4. But row6's missing numbers are 1,2,5. So possible for column1 is 1. Because column1's missing are 1 and 4. But row6's missing includes 1. Therefore, row6's column1 is 1. Now, row6 becomes [1,4,8,9,0,6,7,0,3]. Missing numbers are 2 and 5 in columns5 and 8. Let's check column5 for row6 (0). Column5 entries:\n\nRow1:9\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:7\n\nRow4:4\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:0\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:8.\n\nExisting numbers: 9,1,7,4,5,3,8. Missing are 2,6. Row6's missing numbers are 2 and 5. So possible for column5 is 2. Therefore, row6's column5 is 2. Now, row6 becomes [1,4,8,9,2,6,7,0,3]. Now, missing number in column8 is 5. So row6's column8 is 5. Let me check column8. Existing numbers include 5? No, column8 has 7,9,1,2,4,8,6. Adding 5 is okay. So row6 is [1,4,8,9,2,6,7,5,3]. Complete.\n\nNow, row8: [0,8,9,2,0,0,0,0,1]. Missing numbers are 3,4,5,6,7. Let's check each cell. Columns1,5,6,7,8 are 0. Let's start with column1. Column1 entries: 3,6,8,7,9,1,2, ?,5. Existing are 3,6,8,7,9,1,2,5. Missing is 4. Therefore, row8's column1 must be 4. So row8 becomes [4,8,9,2,0,0,0,0,1]. Now, missing numbers in row8 are 3,5,6,7 in columns5,6,7,8. Let's look at column5 for row8 (0). Column5 entries:\n\nRow1:9\n\nRow2:1\n\nRow3:7\n\nRow4:4\n\nRow5:5\n\nRow6:2\n\nRow7:3\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:8.\n\nExisting are 9,1,7,4,5,2,3,8. Missing is 6. So row8's column5 must be 6. Now, row8 becomes [4,8,9,2,6,0,0,0,1]. Missing numbers are 3,5,7 in columns6,7,8. Let's check column6 for row8 (0). Column6 entries:\n\nRow1:2\n\nRow2:4\n\nRow3:5\n\nRow4:8\n\nRow5:3\n\nRow6:6\n\nRow7:1\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers: 2,4,5,8,3,6,1. Missing are 7,9. But row8's missing are 3,5,7. Wait, row8's current missing numbers after adding 6 are 3,5,7. But column6's missing are 7 and 9. So row8's column6 must be 7. Therefore, row8's column6 is 7. Now, row8 becomes [4,8,9,2,6,7,0,0,1]. Missing numbers are 3 and 5 in columns7 and 8. Let's look at column7 for row8 (0). Column7 entries:\n\nRow1:6\n\nRow2:8\n\nRow3:3\n\nRow4:9\n\nRow5:1\n\nRow6:7\n\nRow7:4\n\nRow8:0\n\nRow9:2.\n\nExisting numbers: 6,8,3,9,1,7,4,2. Missing is 5. Therefore, row8's column7 must be 5. Now, row8 becomes [4,8,9,2,6,7,5,0,1]. Now, missing number in column8 is 3. So row8's column8 is 3. Let me check column8. Existing numbers include 3? No, column8 has 7,9,1,2,4,5,8,6. Adding 3 is okay. So row8 is [4,8,9,2,6,7,5,3,1]. Complete.\n\nFinally, row9: [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 6, 7]. Missing numbers are 1,3,4,9. Let's check each cell. Columns2,3,4,6 are 0. Let's start with column2. Column2 entries: existing are 1 (row1),7 (row2),9 (row3),5 (row4),2 (row5),4 (row6),6 (row7),8 (row8), ?. Missing are 3. Wait, column2's existing numbers are 1,7,9,5,2,4,6,8. Missing is 3. Therefore, row9's column2 must be 3. Now, row9 becomes [5,3,0,0,8,0,2,6,7]. Missing numbers are 1,4,9 in columns3,4,6. Let's check column3 for row9 (0). Column3 entries:\n\nRow1:4\n\nRow2:5\n\nRow3:2\n\nRow4:3\n\nRow5:6\n\nRow6:8\n\nRow7:7\n\nRow8:9\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers: 4,5,2,3,6,8,7,9. Missing is 1. Therefore, row9's column3 is 1. Now, row9 becomes [5,3,1,0,8,0,2,6,7]. Missing numbers are 4 and 9 in columns4 and 6. Let's look at column4 for row9 (0). Column4 entries:\n\nRow1:8\n\nRow2:3\n\nRow3:6\n\nRow4:1\n\nRow5:7\n\nRow6:9\n\nRow7:5\n\nRow8:2\n\nRow9:0.\n\nExisting numbers: 8,3,6,1,7,9,5,2. Missing is 4. Therefore, row9's column4 is 4. Now, row9 becomes [5,3,1,4,8,0,2,6,7]. Missing number in column6 is 9. So row9's column6 is 9. Let me check column6. Existing numbers include 9? No. So it's okay. Now, row9 is [5,3,1,4,8,9,2,6,7]. Complete.\n\nNow, let's verify all rows, columns, and blocks.\n\nRow1: [3,1,4,8,9,2,6,7,5] – all numbers 1-9, no duplicates.\n\nRow2: [6,7,5,3,1,4,8,9,2] – all numbers.\n\nRow3: [8,9,2,6,7,5,3,1,4] – okay.\n\nRow4: [7,5,3,1,4,8,9,2,6] – okay.\n\nRow5: [9,2,6,7,5,3,1,4,8] – okay.\n\nRow6: [1,4,8,9,2,6,7,5,3] – okay.\n\nRow7: [2,6,7,5,3,1,4,8,9] – okay.\n\nRow8: [4,8,9,2,6,7,5,3,1] – okay.\n\nRow9: [5,3,1,4,8,9,2,6,7] – okay.\n\nColumns:\n\nCheck column1: 3,6,8,7,9,1,2,4,5 – all 1-9.\n\nColumn2: 1,7,9,5,2,4,6,8,3 – all.\n\nColumn3: 4,5,2,3,6,8,7,9,1 – all.\n\nColumn4: 8,3,6,1,7,9,5,2,4 – all.\n\nColumn5: 9,1,7,4,5,2,3,6,8 – all.\n\nColumn6: 2,4,5,8,3,6,1,7,9 – all.\n\nColumn7: 6,8,3,9,1,7,4,5,2 – all.\n\nColumn8: 7,9,1,2,4,5,8,3,6 – all.\n\nColumn9: 5,2,4,6,8,3,9,1,7 – all.\n\nBlocks:\n\nTop-left: rows1-3, columns1-3:\n\n3,1,4\n\n6,7,5\n\n8,9,2 – all numbers.\n\nTop-middle: rows1-3, columns4-6:\n\n8,9,2\n\n3,1,4\n\n6,7,5 – all numbers.\n\nTop-right: rows1-3, columns7-9:\n\n6,7,5\n\n8,9,2\n\n3,1,4 – all numbers.\n\nMiddle-left: rows4-6, columns1-3:\n\n7,5,3\n\n9,2,6\n\n1,4,8 – all numbers.\n\nMiddle-middle: rows4-6, columns4-6:\n\n1,4,8\n\n7,5,3\n\n9,2,6 – all numbers.\n\nMiddle-right: rows4-6, columns7-9:\n\n9,2,6\n\n1,4,8\n\n7,5,3 – all numbers.\n\nBottom-left: rows7-9, columns1-3:\n\n2,6,7\n\n4,8,9\n\n5,3,1 – all numbers.\n\nBottom-middle: rows7-9, columns4-6:\n\n5,3,1\n\n2,6,7\n\n4,8,9 – all numbers.\n\nBottom-right: rows7-9, columns7-9:\n\n4,8,9\n\n5,3,1\n\n2,6,7 – all numbers.\n\nAll checks out.

      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. Hmm, I need to fill in the zeros with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 block has all numbers without repetition. Let me start by looking at the given board.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the current board to visualize it better:\n\nRow 0: [9, 4, 1, 6, 0, 8, 0, 5, 3]\nRow 1: [0, 5, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 8]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 0]\nRow 3: [2, 8, 0, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 6]\nRow 4: [5, 3, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 6, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 9]\nRow 6: [0, 7, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 0, 2]\nRow 7: [0, 0, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [3, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 5]\n\nStarting with Row 0. The missing numbers are 2, 7, and 9? Wait, let me check. The existing numbers in Row 0 are 9,4,1,6,8,5,3. So missing are 2,7, maybe others? Let me count: 1,3,4,5,6,8,9. Missing are 2,7, maybe others. Wait, the row has 9 elements. Let me check again. The existing numbers in row 0 are 9,4,1,6,8,5,3. Wait, 9,4,1,6,8,5,3. That's 7 numbers. So missing are 2,7, maybe others. Wait, numbers 1-9. Let me list them: 1 is present, 2 missing, 3 present, 4 present, 5 present, 6 present, 7 missing, 8 present, 9 present. So missing in row 0 are 2 and 7. But there are three zeros in row 0. Wait, row 0 has three zeros? Let me check the original input. Row 0 is [9,4,1,6,0,8,0,5,3]. So positions 4 and 6 are zeros. Wait, that's two zeros. Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let me check again. The row is 9,4,1,6,0,8,0,5,3. So positions 4 and 6 are zeros. So two zeros. Wait, but that would mean two numbers missing. But according to my earlier analysis, two numbers are missing. So maybe I made a mistake. Let me recount the numbers in row 0. The numbers are 9,4,1,6, (then 0), 8, (0), 5, 3. So existing numbers are 1,3,4,5,6,8,9. Missing are 2,7. So two numbers. But there are two zeros. So each zero must be filled with one of these numbers. Let's look at the positions. Position 4 (row 0, column 4) and position 6 (row 0, column 6).\n\nLooking at column 4 for position (0,4). Column 4 is: row 0: 0, row1: 0, row2:5, row3:3, row4:0, row5:8, row6:0, row7:7, row8:6. So existing numbers in column 4 are 5,3,8,7,6. So missing in column 4 are 1,2,4,9. But in row 0, the missing are 2 and 7. Wait, but column 4's missing numbers include 2. So possible for position (0,4) to be 2 or 7? Wait, but column 4's existing numbers are 5,3,8,7,6. Wait, row7's column4 is 7. So 7 is already in column 4. Therefore, position (0,4) can't be 7. So only possible is 2. So (0,4) must be 2. Then (0,6) would be 7.\n\nLet me check that. If (0,4) is 2, then column 4 would have 2 added. Then (0,6) is 7. Let me check if 7 is allowed in column 6. Column 6: row0:0, row1:0, row2:9, row3:4, row4:0, row5:0, row6:1, row7:3, row8:8. Existing numbers are 9,4,1,3,8. So missing are 2,5,6,7. So 7 is allowed here. So yes. So row0 becomes [9,4,1,6,2,8,7,5,3]. Let me update that.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's check row 1: [0,5,3,0,0,1,0,2,8]. Missing numbers in row 1: existing numbers are 5,3,1,2,8. Missing are 4,6,7,9. Let's look for cells that can be filled.\n\nLooking at column 0 for row1's first cell (row1, column0). Column0 has existing numbers: row0:9, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:5, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:3. Existing numbers are 9,2,5,3. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 1,4,6,7,8. But row1's missing are 4,6,7,9. So possible candidates are 4,6,7,9. Also, check the 3x3 block. The block for row1, column0 is block (0,0) which includes rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. Existing numbers in this block: row0:9,4,1; row1: ?,5,3; row2: ?, ?,8. So existing numbers are 9,4,1,5,3,8. Missing are 2,6,7. Wait, but row1's missing numbers are 4,6,7,9. Wait, but in the block, missing are 2,6,7. Therefore, the cell (1,0) is part of this block. Since the block's missing numbers are 2,6,7, but row1's missing numbers for this cell are 4,6,7,9. So the intersection is 6 and 7. Therefore, possible numbers are 6 or 7. But column0's existing numbers are 9,2,5,3. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 1,4,6,7,8. But from the block and row, the possible are 6,7. So maybe we can find more info.\n\nAlternatively, maybe look at other cells in row1. Let's look at (1,3) and (1,4), which are zeros. Let's check column3 for (1,3). Column3: row0:6, row1:0, row2:7, row3:5, row4:4, row5:0, row6:3, row7:8, row8:0. Existing numbers are 6,7,5,4,3,8. Missing are 1,2,9. So possible for (1,3) is 1,2,9. But row1's missing are 4,6,7,9. So only 9 is possible here. So (1,3) must be 9? Wait, but column3's missing includes 9. Let me check. If (1,3) is 9, then that would be allowed. Let's see if there's any conflict in the block. The block for (1,3) is block (0,1), columns 3-5, rows 0-2. Let's see existing numbers in that block. Row0: columns3-5 are 6,0 (now 2?), 8. Wait, row0's column4 is 2. So row0 columns 3-5 are 6, 2, 8. Row1 columns3-5: 0 (now 9?), 0, 1. Row2 columns3-5: 7,5,3. So existing numbers in the block are 6,2,8,7,5,3,1. Missing are 4,9. Wait, but if we put 9 in (1,3), then the block would have 9, which is allowed. Because the existing numbers are 6,2,8,7,5,3,1. Adding 9 would leave 4 missing. But the cell (1,4) in row1 is also in this block. Let me check if there's any conflict. So if (1,3) is 9, then (1,4) would be in the same block and row. Let's see. If (1,3) is 9, then row1's missing numbers would be 4,6,7. Because we already filled 9 in (1,3). Wait, row1's original missing numbers were 4,6,7,9. If we add 9, then missing are 4,6,7. Now, looking at (1,4), which is column4. Column4's existing numbers include 2 (from row0), 5 (row2), 3 (row3), 0 (row4), 8 (row5), 0 (row6), 7 (row7), 6 (row8). Wait, column4 has existing numbers 2,5,3,8,7,6. Missing are 1,4,9. But row1's (1,4) is in row1, which now missing 4,6,7. So possible numbers for (1,4) are 4,6,7. But column4's missing are 1,4,9. So only 4 is possible. Therefore, (1,4) must be 4. Let me check if that's allowed. If (1,4) is 4, then column4 has 4 added. Also, in the block (0,1), which includes (1,4), adding 4 would be okay because it's not present yet. So yes. Then, (1,4) is 4. Now, row1's missing numbers are 6 and 7 (since we had 4,6,7 missing, and added 4 and 9). Wait, original missing were 4,6,7,9. After adding 9 and 4, remaining missing are 6 and 7. Now, looking at the other zeros in row1: (1,0), (1,3)=9, (1,4)=4, (1,6)=0. So the remaining zeros are (1,0) and (1,6). Let's check (1,6). Column6: existing numbers are 7 (row0), 0 (row1), 9 (row2), 4 (row3), 0 (row4), 0 (row5), 1 (row6), 3 (row7), 8 (row8). So existing are 7,9,4,1,3,8. Missing are 2,5,6. Row1's missing are 6 and 7. So possible for (1,6) is 6 or 7? But column6's missing are 2,5,6. So possible is 6. Because 7 is already in column6 (row0). Therefore, (1,6) must be 6. Then, (1,0) would be the remaining number, which is 7. Let me check that.\n\nSo row1 would be [7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8]. Let me verify:\n\n- Row1 has 7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n- Column0 for (1,0)=7: column0 has 9,7, etc. No duplicates.\n- Block (0,0) for (1,0)=7: existing numbers are 9,4,1,5,3,8,7. Wait, the block includes rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. So row0: 9,4,1. row1:7,5,3. row2: ?, ?,8. So numbers are 9,4,1,7,5,3, and whatever is in row2's first two cells. But adding 7 here is okay because it's the first time in this block. So that's okay.\n\nSo row1 is filled. Now let's look at row2: [0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 0]. Missing numbers in row2: existing numbers are 8,7,5,3,9,4. Missing are 1,2,6. The zeros are in positions (2,0), (2,1), and (2,8). Let's check column0 for (2,0). Column0 has existing numbers: 9 (row0), 7 (row1), ?, row3:2, row4:5, row5: ?, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8:3. Existing numbers are 9,7,2,5,3. Missing are 1,4,6,8. But row2's missing are 1,2,6. So possible for (2,0) is 1, 6? Because 2 is missing in row2 but column0's existing numbers include 2? Wait, column0 has row3 as 2, so (2,0) can't be 2. Therefore, possible numbers for (2,0) are 1 and 6. Let's check the block. The block for (2,0) is block (0,0), which includes rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Existing numbers in this block: row0: 9,4,1; row1:7,5,3; row2: ?, ?,8. So existing numbers are 9,4,1,7,5,3,8. Missing are 2,6. Therefore, (2,0) can be 2 or 6? But row2's missing are 1,2,6. But according to the block, missing are 2 and 6. Therefore, (2,0) must be either 2 or 6. But row2's missing includes 2 and 6. So possible. Let's see if there's another way.\n\nLooking at column8 for (2,8). Column8 has existing numbers: row0:3, row1:8, row2:0, row3:6, row4:0, row5:9, row6:2, row7:0, row8:5. Existing numbers are 3,8,6,9,2,5. Missing are 1,4,7. But row2's missing are 1,2,6. So for (2,8), possible numbers are 1 (since it's missing in column8 and row2). Because 2 is not in column8's missing. Wait, row2's missing includes 1, which is missing in column8. So (2,8) could be 1. Let me check. If (2,8) is 1, then row2's missing would be 2 and 6. Now, looking at (2,0) and (2,1). Let's check column0 and column1 for these cells.\n\nIf (2,8)=1, then row2 is [?, ?, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1]. Now, missing in row2 are 2 and 6. Let's look at (2,0) and (2,1). \n\nFor (2,0): column0 missing are 1,4,6,8. But row2's missing are 2 and 6. Wait, no. If row2's missing are 2 and 6, then (2,0) must be either 2 or 6. But column0's existing numbers are 9,7,2 (row3?), row3 is 2. Wait, column0's existing numbers are 9 (row0), 7 (row1), 2 (row3), 5 (row4), 3 (row8). So column0 already has 2 in row3. Therefore, (2,0) can't be 2. So (2,0) must be 6. Then (2,1) must be 2. Let me check.\n\nSo (2,0)=6, (2,1)=2. Then row2 becomes [6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1]. Let me check:\n\n- Row2 has 6,2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n- Column0 for 6: column0 has 9,7,6, etc. No duplicates. Good.\n- Block (0,0) now has 6 and 2 in row2's first two cells. Existing numbers in the block are 9,4,1,7,5,3,8,6,2. All numbers 1-9. Perfect.\n\nSo row2 is filled. Now moving to row3: [2, 8, 0, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 6]. Missing numbers in row3: existing are 2,8,5,3,4,1,6. Missing are 7,9. The zeros are at (3,2) and (3,5). Let's check column2 for (3,2). Column2 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:3, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:6, row6:5, row7:2, row8:0. Existing are 1,3,8,6,5,2. Missing are 4,7,9. Row3's missing are 7,9. So possible for (3,2) is 7 or 9. Let's check the block. Row3 is in block (1,0) (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). The existing numbers in this block: row3: 2,8, ?, row4:5,3, ?, row5: ?, ?,6. Let me see. Existing numbers in this block are 2,8,5,3,6. Missing are 1,4,7,9. But row3's missing are 7 and 9. So possible for (3,2) is 7 or 9. Let's check column5 for (3,5). Column5 has existing numbers: row0:8, row1:1, row2:3, row3:0, row4:6, row5:7, row6:4, row7:5, row8:0. Existing numbers are 8,1,3,6,7,4,5. Missing are 2,9. But row3's missing are 7 and 9. So for (3,5), possible is 9 (since 7 is not in column5's missing). Therefore, (3,5) must be 9. Then (3,2) would be 7. Let me check:\n\nIf (3,5)=9, then column5 has 9 added. Then (3,2)=7. Let me check if that's allowed. For (3,2)=7, column2's existing numbers include 7? Let's see. Column2's existing are 1,3,8,6,5,2. Adding 7 is okay. Also, in the block (1,0), adding 7 is allowed. Then row3 becomes [2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6]. Let me check:\n\n- All numbers present. Good.\n\nNow, row4: [5, 3, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0]. Missing numbers in row4: existing are 5,3,4,6. Missing are 1,2,7,8,9. Let's look for cells that can be filled. Let's check column2 for (4,2). Column2 has existing numbers: 1 (row0), 3 (row1), 8 (row2), 7 (row3), ?, 6 (row5), 5 (row6), 2 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing are 1,3,8,7,6,5,2. Missing are 4,9. But row4's missing includes 1,2,7,8,9. So (4,2) can't be 4 or 9 because those aren't in row4's missing. Wait, this suggests a problem. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.\n\nRow4 is [5,3,0,4,0,6,0,0,0]. Missing numbers are 1,2,7,8,9. Let me check each zero cell.\n\nLooking at (4,2) (row4, column2). Column2's existing numbers are 1 (row0), 3 (row1), 8 (row2), 7 (row3), ?, 6 (row5), 5 (row6), 2 (row7), and row8's column2 is 0. So existing are 1,3,8,7,6,5,2. Missing in column2 are 4 and 9. But row4's missing numbers are 1,2,7,8,9. So there's a conflict here. Wait, that suggests that (4,2) can't be filled with any number because column2's missing numbers (4,9) are not in row4's missing. Which indicates an error in my previous steps. Let me backtrack.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in filling row3. Let me check row3 again. Row3 was [2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6]. That seems correct. Let me check column2. Column2 now has 1 (row0), 3 (row1), 8 (row2), 7 (row3), and row4's column2 is 0. Then row5's column2 is 6, row6's is 5, row7's is 2, row8's is 0. So existing numbers are 1,3,8,7,6,5,2. Missing are 4 and 9. So for row4's (4,2) which is column2, it must be 4 or 9. But row4's missing numbers are 1,2,7,8,9. Wait, 9 is in row4's missing. So (4,2) can be 9. Because 9 is in row4's missing and column2's missing. Therefore, (4,2) is 9. Let me check. If (4,2)=9, then row4 becomes [5,3,9,4,0,6,0,0,0]. Now, missing numbers in row4 are 1,2,7,8. Let me check if that's correct. Original missing were 1,2,7,8,9. After adding 9, missing are 1,2,7,8. Now, looking at the other zeros in row4: (4,4), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\nLet me look at (4,4) (row4, column4). Column4 has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:4, row2:5, row3:3, row4:0, row5:8, row6:0, row7:7, row8:6. Existing numbers are 2,4,5,3,8,7,6. Missing are 1,9. But row4's missing numbers are 1,2,7,8. Wait, so (4,4) can't be 9 because it's not in row4's missing. Wait, column4's missing are 1 and 9. But row4's missing are 1,2,7,8. So possible for (4,4) is 1. Let me check. If (4,4)=1, then column4 is okay. Let me check the block. (4,4) is in block (1,1), which is rows 3-5, columns 3-5. Existing numbers in this block: row3:5,3,9; row4:4, ?, 6; row5: ?,8,7. Existing numbers are 5,3,9,4,6,8,7. Missing are 1,2. So (4,4)=1 is allowed. So yes. Then (4,4)=1. Now, row4 becomes [5,3,9,4,1,6,0,0,0]. Missing are 2,7,8.\n\nNow, looking at (4,6) (row4, column6). Column6 has existing numbers: row0:7, row1:6, row2:9, row3:4, row4:0, row5:0, row6:1, row7:3, row8:8. Existing are 7,6,9,4,1,3,8. Missing are 2,5. But row4's missing are 2,7,8. So possible for (4,6) is 2 (since 2 is missing in column6 and row4's missing). So (4,6)=2. Then row4 becomes [5,3,9,4,1,6,2,0,0]. Missing are 7 and 8. Now, looking at (4,7) and (4,8). Let's check column7 for (4,7). Column7 has existing numbers: row0:5, row1:2, row2:4, row3:1, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 5,2,4,1. Missing are 3,6,7,8,9. But row4's missing are 7 and 8. So possible for (4,7) is 7 or 8. Let's check the block. (4,7) is in block (1,2) (rows 3-5, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in this block: row3:4,1,6; row4:2, ?, ?; row5: ?, ?,9. Existing numbers are 4,1,6,2,9. Missing are 3,5,7,8. So (4,7) can be 7 or 8. Let's see if there's a way to determine which. Looking at column8 for (4,8). Column8 has existing numbers: 3,8,1,6,9,2,5. Missing are 4,7. But row4's missing are 7 and 8. So (4,8) can't be 4, so must be 7. Therefore, (4,8)=7. Then (4,7) must be 8. Let me check:\n\nIf (4,8)=7, then column8 has 7 added. Then (4,7)=8. Let's check column7 for 8. Column7's existing numbers are 5,2,4,1. Adding 8 is allowed. Also, in the block (1,2), adding 8 and 7 is okay. So row4 becomes [5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7]. Let me verify:\n\n- Row4 has 5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow, moving to row5: [0, 0, 6, 0, 8, 7, 0, 0, 9]. Missing numbers in row5: existing are 6,8,7,9. Missing are 1,2,3,4,5. Let's check zeros at (5,0), (5,1), (5,3), (5,6), (5,7).\n\nLet's look for cells that can be filled. Let's check (5,3) (column3). Column3 has existing numbers: 6 (row0), 9 (row1), 7 (row2), 5 (row3), 4 (row4), 0 (row5), 3 (row6), 8 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing are 6,9,7,5,4,3,8. Missing are 1,2. So (5,3) can be 1 or 2. Let's check the block. (5,3) is in block (1,1) (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in this block: row3:5,3,9; row4:4,1,6; row5: ?,8,7. Existing numbers are 5,3,9,4,1,6,8,7. Missing are 2. Therefore, (5,3) must be 2. So (5,3)=2. Now, row5 becomes [0,0,6,2,8,7,0,0,9]. Missing numbers in row5 are now 1,3,4,5.\n\nLooking at (5,0) and (5,1). Let's check column0 for (5,0). Column0 has existing numbers: 9 (row0),7 (row1),6 (row2),2 (row3),5 (row4), ?, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8:3. Existing are 9,7,6,2,5,3. Missing are 1,4,8. Row5's missing are 1,3,4,5. So possible for (5,0) is 1 or 4. Let's check the block. (5,0) is in block (1,0) (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block: row3:2,8,7; row4:5,3,9; row5: ?, ?,6. Existing are 2,8,7,5,3,9,6. Missing are 1,4. Therefore, (5,0) can be 1 or 4. Let's see if there's another clue. Looking at row5's missing numbers. Let's also check column1 for (5,1). Column1 has existing numbers: 4 (row0),5 (row1),0 (row2=2?), row3:8, row4:3, row5: ?, row6:7, row7: ?, row8:9. Existing numbers are 4,5,2,8,3,7,9. Missing are 1,6. But row5's missing are 1,3,4,5. So (5,1) can be 1 (since it's missing in column1 and row5). Let me check if that's possible. If (5,1)=1, then (5,0) must be 4 (since block missing are 1 and 4). Let me check:\n\nIf (5,1)=1, then column1 has 1 added. Then (5,0) must be 4 (since block missing are 1 and 4, and (5,0) is in the block). Let me check if 4 is allowed in column0. Column0 has existing numbers 9,7,6,2,5,3. Adding 4 is okay. So row5 becomes [4,1,6,2,8,7,0,0,9]. Now, missing in row5 are 3 and 5. Let's check (5,6) and (5,7).\n\nLooking at (5,6) (column6). Column6 has existing numbers:7 (row0),6 (row1),9 (row2),4 (row3),2 (row4), ?, 1 (row6),3 (row7),8 (row8). Existing are 7,6,9,4,2,1,3,8. Missing is 5. Therefore, (5,6)=5. Then (5,7) must be 3 (since row5's missing are 3 and 5, and 5 is filled). Let me check column7 for (5,7). Column7 has existing numbers:5 (row0),2 (row1),4 (row2),1 (row3),8 (row4), ?, 0 (row6), 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing are 5,2,4,1,8. Adding 3 is allowed. So row5 becomes [4,1,6,2,8,7,5,3,9]. Let me verify:\n\n- All numbers present. Good.\n\nNow, moving to row6: [0, 7, 5, 3, 0, 4, 1, 0, 2]. Missing numbers in row6: existing are 7,5,3,4,1,2. Missing are 6,8,9. The zeros are at (6,0), (6,4), (6,7).\n\nLet's check (6,0) (column0). Column0 has existing numbers:9,7,6,2,5,4, ?, ?, 3. Existing are 9,7,6,2,5,4,3. Missing are 1,8. But row6's missing are 6,8,9. Wait, no. Wait row6's missing are 6,8,9? Let me recount. Row6's existing numbers are 7,5,3,4,1,2. Missing are 6,8,9. So possible for (6,0) is 6,8,9. But column0's existing numbers are 9,7,6,2,5,4,3. Missing are 1,8. Therefore, (6,0) can be 8. Because 8 is missing in column0 and in row6's missing. So (6,0)=8. Then row6 becomes [8,7,5,3,0,4,1,0,2]. Missing are 6,9 in row6. Now, looking at (6,4) (column4). Column4 has existing numbers:2 (row0),4 (row1),5 (row2),3 (row3),1 (row4),8 (row5), ?, 7 (row7),6 (row8). Existing are 2,4,5,3,1,8,7,6. Missing is 9. Therefore, (6,4)=9. Then row6 becomes [8,7,5,3,9,4,1,0,2]. Missing is 6 in (6,7). Column7 has existing numbers:5 (row0),2 (row1),4 (row2),1 (row3),8 (row4),3 (row5), ?, 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing are 5,2,4,1,8,3. Adding 6 is allowed. So (6,7)=6. Now, row6 is [8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2]. Let me check:\n\n- All numbers present. Good.\n\nNow, row7: [0, 0, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 0, 0]. Missing numbers in row7: existing are 2,8,7,5,3. Missing are 1,4,6,9. The zeros are at (7,0), (7,1), (7,7), (7,8).\n\nLet's check (7,0) (column0). Column0 has existing numbers:9,7,6,2,5,4,8, ?, 3. Existing are 9,7,6,2,5,4,8,3. Missing is 1. Therefore, (7,0)=1. Then row7 becomes [1, 0, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 0, 0]. Missing are 4,6,9 in row7. Now, looking at (7,1) (column1). Column1 has existing numbers:4 (row0),5 (row1),2 (row2),8 (row3),3 (row4),1 (row5),7 (row6), ?, 9 (row8). Existing are 4,5,2,8,3,1,7,9. Missing is 6. Therefore, (7,1)=6. Now, row7 becomes [1,6,2,8,7,5,3,0,0]. Missing are 4 and 9 in row7. Let's check (7,7) and (7,8). Column7 for (7,7): existing numbers are 5,2,4,1,8,3,6. Missing are 7,9. But row7's missing are 4 and 9. Wait, column7's existing numbers include 5 (row0), 2 (row1), 4 (row2), 1 (row3), 8 (row4), 3 (row5), 6 (row6), and row7's current is 0. So existing are 5,2,4,1,8,3,6. Missing are 7,9. But row7's missing are 4 and 9. Wait, 4 is already in column7. So (7,7) must be 9. Then (7,8) must be 4. Let me check column8 for (7,8). Column8 has existing numbers:3,8,1,6,7,9,2,5. Missing are 4. So yes, (7,8)=4. Therefore, (7,7)=9. So row7 becomes [1,6,2,8,7,5,3,9,4]. Let me check:\n\n- All numbers present. Good.\n\nFinally, row8: [3, 9, 0, 0, 6, 0, 8, 0, 5]. Missing numbers in row8: existing are 3,9,6,8,5. Missing are 1,2,4,7. The zeros are at (8,2), (8,3), (8,5), (8,7).\n\nLet's check (8,2) (column2). Column2 has existing numbers:1 (row0),3 (row1),8 (row2),7 (row3),9 (row4),6 (row5),5 (row6),2 (row7), ?. Existing are 1,3,8,7,9,6,5,2. Missing is 4. Therefore, (8,2)=4. Now, row8 becomes [3,9,4,0,6,0,8,0,5]. Missing are 1,2,7 in row8. Let's check (8,3) (column3). Column3 has existing numbers:6 (row0),9 (row1),7 (row2),5 (row3),4 (row4),2 (row5),3 (row6),8 (row7), ?. Existing are 6,9,7,5,4,2,3,8. Missing is 1. Therefore, (8,3)=1. Now, row8 becomes [3,9,4,1,6,0,8,0,5]. Missing are 2 and 7. Now, looking at (8,5) (column5). Column5 has existing numbers:8 (row0),1 (row1),3 (row2),9 (row3),6 (row4),7 (row5),4 (row6),5 (row7), ?. Existing are 8,1,3,9,6,7,4,5. Missing is 2. Therefore, (8,5)=2. Then (8,7) must be 7. Let me check column7 for (8,7). Column7 has existing numbers:5,2,4,1,8,3,6,9, ?. Existing are 5,2,4,1,8,3,6,9. Missing is 7. So yes. Therefore, row8 becomes [3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7,5]. Let me check:\n\n- All numbers present. Good.\n\nNow, let me verify all rows, columns, and blocks.\n\nFor example, check column0: 9,7,6,2,5,4,8,1,3. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nCheck block (0,0): rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Row0:9,4,1; row1:7,5,3; row2:6,2,8. All numbers present. Good.\n\nCheck block (2,2): rows 6-8, columns 6-8. Row6:1,6,2; row7:3,9,4; row8:8,7,5. Wait, no. Block (2,2) is rows 6-8, columns 6-8. Row6: [8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2] → columns 6-8: 1,6,2. Row7: [1,6,2,8,7,5,3,9,4] → columns 6-8: 3,9,4. Row8: [3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7,5] → columns 6-8: 8,7,5. Combined numbers: 1,6,2,3,9,4,8,7,5. All 1-9. Good.\n\nLooks like all rows, columns, and blocks are valid. So the final Sudoku solution is:\n\nRow0: [9,4,1,6,2,8,7,5,3]\nRow1: [7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8]\nRow2: [6,2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1]\nRow3: [2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6]\nRow4: [5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7]\nRow5: [4,1,6,2,8,7,5,3,9]\nRow6: [8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6,2]\nRow7: [1,6,2,8,7,5,3,9,4]\nRow8: [3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7,5]\n\nWait, but row3 was [2,8,7,5,3,9,4,1,6]. Let me check if that's correct. Yes, because earlier steps filled row3 as such. Also, row4 is [5,3,9,4,1,6,2,8,7], which is correct. All seems okay.\n ;Answer: [[9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3], [7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8], [6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1], [2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1, 6], [5, 3, 9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7], [4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9], [8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 1, 6, 2], [1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5, 3, 9, 4], [3, 9, 4, 1, 6, 2, 8, 7, 5]]"

  {
    "response": [
      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the current board and figure out where to start. Let me write down the given board again to visualize it better.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: [4, 0, 5, 1, 7, 8, 3, 2, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 8, 0, 2, 9, 4, 0, 0]\nRow 2: [3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8]\nRow 3: [7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0]\nRow 4: [2, 0, 4, 6, 5, 1, 0, 8, 3]\nRow 5: [6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 9, 4]\nRow 6: [0, 3, 0, 9, 4, 6, 0, 1, 0]\nRow 7: [5, 0, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 4, 6]\nRow 8: [0, 4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8, 0, 2]\n\nHmm. Let me start by looking for cells that have only one possible number based on their row, column, and 3x3 block. Let me check each row, column, and block for missing numbers.\n\nStarting with Row 0: [4, 0, 5, 1, 7, 8, 3, 2, 0]. The missing numbers here are 6, 9. Because existing numbers are 4,5,1,7,8,3,2. So missing are 6 and 9. The last cell (position 8) is 0. Let me check column 8. Column 8 has numbers: 0 (row0), 0 (row1), 8 (row2), 0 (row3), 3 (row4), 4 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 2 (row8). So existing numbers in column 8 are 8,3,4,6,2. So possible numbers for row0, column8 are 1,5,7,9? Wait no, the row is already missing 6 and 9. Wait, row0 has existing numbers 4,5,1,7,8,3,2. So missing are 6,9. So the two zeros in row0 (positions 1 and 8) need to be 6 and 9. Let me check column 1 for row0, position1. Column 1 has numbers: 0 (row0), 7 (row1), 0 (row2), 8 (row3), 0 (row4), 0 (row5), 3 (row6), 0 (row7), 4 (row8). So existing numbers in column1: 7,8,3,4. So possible numbers for row0, column1 are 1,2,5,6,9. But row0 already has 4,5, etc. Wait, row0's missing are 6 and 9. So for row0, column1, the possible numbers are 6 and 9. Now, check the 3x3 block. Row0 is in the top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Let me look at that block. The existing numbers are:\n\nRow0: 4, 0, 5\nRow1: 0,7,8\nRow2: 3, 0,9\n\nSo existing numbers in the block are 4,5,7,8,3,9. Missing are 1,2,6. Wait, but row0's missing numbers are 6 and 9? Wait no, row0's missing numbers are 6 and 9. But in the block, 9 is already present in row2, column2. So the missing numbers in the block are 1, 2, 6? Wait, the block's numbers are 4,5,7,8,3,9. So missing numbers are 1, 2, 6. Therefore, the possible numbers for row0, column1 (which is in this block) can't be 9 because the block already has 9. So row0, column1 can only be 6. Because row0's missing numbers are 6 and 9, but the block can't have 9 again. So row0, column1 must be 6. Then the other zero in row0, column8 must be 9. Let me check that.\n\nSo row0 becomes [4, 6, 5, 1, 7, 8, 3, 2, 9]. Let me verify column8. The column8 for row0 is 9. That's okay because column8 had existing numbers as before (before I filled it) but now adding 9. Also, check the block for row0, column8. Wait, row0, column8 is in the top-right block (columns 6-8, rows 0-2). Let me check that block. The existing numbers there are:\n\nRow0: 3,2,9 (after filling)\nRow1: 4, 0, 0\nRow2: 1, 0,8.\n\nSo existing numbers in that block: 3,2,9,4,1,8. Missing are 5,6,7. Wait, but I filled 9 in row0, column8. That's okay because the block didn't have 9 before. Wait, no, the block is rows 0-2, columns 6-8. Original row0's column6 is 3, column7 is 2, column8 is 9. So yes, that's okay. So that seems valid. So row0 is fixed now.\n\nNow moving on. Let's check row1: [0, 7, 8, 0, 2, 9, 4, 0, 0]. Missing numbers in row1 are 1,3,5,6. Let's look for cells where only one possibility exists. Let's check each zero in this row.\n\nFirst cell (row1, column0): possible numbers. Column0 has existing numbers: 4 (row0), 0 (row1), 3 (row2), 7 (row3), 2 (row4), 6 (row5), 0 (row6), 5 (row7), 0 (row8). So existing in column0: 4,3,7,2,6,5. Missing are 1,8,9. But row1's missing numbers are 1,3,5,6. Wait, the possible numbers for row1, column0 must be in both the row's missing and column's missing. So row's missing in row1 are 1,3,5,6. Column0's missing are 1,8,9. The intersection is only 1. Therefore, row1, column0 must be 1. Great! So fill that in.\n\nSo row1 becomes [1,7,8, 0,2,9,4, 0, 0]. Now, the next zeros in this row are columns 3, 7, 8. Let's check column3 (row1, column3). Column3's existing numbers: 1 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2), 0 (row3), 6 (row4), 0 (row5), 9 (row6), 8 (row7),5 (row8). So existing numbers: 1,6,9,8,5. Missing are 2,3,4,7. But row1's missing numbers are now (since we filled 1) 3,5,6. Wait, original row1's missing numbers after filling 1 are 3,5,6. Wait, original row was missing 1,3,5,6. Now that 1 is filled, missing are 3,5,6. But column3's possible numbers for this cell must be in row's missing. So possible numbers for row1, column3 are 3,5,6. But column3's missing numbers are 2,3,4,7. So the intersection is 3. Therefore, row1, column3 must be 3. Let me check the block. Row1 is in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Let me check existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow0: columns 3-5: 1,7,8\nRow1: columns 3-5: 0 (now 3?), 2,9\nRow2: columns 3-5: 0, 0, 0.\n\nExisting numbers in the block would be 1,7,8, 3,2,9. So missing are 4,5,6. Wait, if I put 3 in row1, column3, but the block already has 3? No, the block is columns 3-5. The existing numbers in that block are 1,7,8,2,9. Adding 3 would be okay. So that's valid. So row1, column3 is 3. Now row1 is [1,7,8,3,2,9,4, 0, 0]. Now the missing numbers in row1 are 5 and 6 (since filled 1 and 3). The remaining zeros are columns 7 and 8. Let's check column7 (row1, column7). Column7's existing numbers: 2 (row0), 0 (row1), 0 (row2),5 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),1 (row6),4 (row7),0 (row8). So existing in column7: 2,5,8,9,1,4. Missing are 3,6,7. But row1's missing are 5 and 6. Wait, row1's missing numbers are 5 and 6? Wait, original row was missing 1,3,5,6. We filled 1 and 3, so remaining are 5 and 6. But column7's missing are 3,6,7. So possible numbers for row1, column7 are 6 (since 5 is not in column7's missing). Wait, column7's existing numbers include 2,5, etc. Wait, column7's existing numbers are 2 (row0), now row1's column7 is being considered. Let me recheck column7:\n\nRow0: column7 is 2\nRow1: column7 is 0\nRow2: column7 is 0\nRow3: column7 is 5\nRow4: column7 is 8\nRow5: column7 is 9\nRow6: column7 is 1\nRow7: column7 is 4\nRow8: column7 is 0\n\nSo existing numbers in column7 are 2,5,8,9,1,4. So missing are 3,6,7. So possible numbers for row1, column7 are 6 (since row1's missing numbers are 5 and 6). Wait, 6 is in column7's missing. So possible. But 5 is not in column7's missing? Wait, column7 has 5 already (row3, column7 is 5). So row1's missing numbers are 5 and 6. But column7 cannot have 5 again. Therefore, for row1, column7, the possible number is 6. Then column8 (row1, column8) would be 5. Let me check that. \n\nSo row1, column7 is 6, column8 is 5. Let me check if that's valid. For column8, existing numbers before were 9 (row0), 0 (row1), 8 (row2), 0 (row3), 3 (row4), 4 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 2 (row8). Adding 5 in row1, column8 would be okay. Also, check the block for row1, column7 and 8. They are in the top-right block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block after previous fills: row0 has 3,2,9; row1 has 4,6,5; row2 has 1, ?, 8. Let me see. So numbers in the block would be 3,2,9,4,6,5,1, and whatever is in row2's columns 7. Wait, row2's column7 is still 0. But for the current row1's cells, adding 6 and 5 would be okay as they are unique. So row1 is now [1,7,8,3,2,9,4,6,5]. Let me check if that's valid. Each number 1-9 in the row, no duplicates. Yes. So row1 is filled.\n\nNow moving to row2: [3, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Missing numbers in row2 are 2,4,5,6,7. Let me check each zero. Let's look for cells with only one possibility. \n\nFirst, column1 (row2, column1 is 0). Column1's existing numbers: 6 (row0),7 (row1),0 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),0 (row5),3 (row6),0 (row7),4 (row8). Existing numbers in column1: 6,7,8,3,4. Missing are 1,2,5,9. But row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5,6,7. The intersection is 2,5. So possible numbers here are 2 or 5. Let me check the block. Row2 is in the top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Existing numbers there are 4,6,5 (row0), 1,7,8 (row1), 3, ?, 9 (row2). So existing numbers: 4,6,5,1,7,8,3,9. Missing is 2. Therefore, row2, column1 must be 2. Because the block needs 2. So fill that in. Now row2 becomes [3,2,9, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Now, missing numbers in row2 are 4,5,6,7. Let's check next zeros.\n\nLooking at column3 (row2, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: 1 (row0),3 (row1), ?, 0 (row2), 0 (row3),6 (row4),0 (row5),9 (row6),8 (row7),5 (row8). Existing numbers: 1,3,6,9,8,5. Missing are 2,4,7. Row2's missing are 4,5,6,7. So possible numbers for column3 are 4,7. Let me check the block. Row2, column3 is in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in this block: row0: 1,7,8; row1:3,2,9; row2: ?, ?, ?. So existing numbers are 1,7,8,3,2,9. Missing are 4,5,6. Therefore, the cell row2, column3 must be one of 4,5,6. But column3's possible are 4,7. The intersection is 4. Therefore, row2, column3 is 4. So fill that in. Now row2 is [3,2,9,4, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Missing numbers are 5,6,7.\n\nNow, column4 (row2, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: 7 (row0),2 (row1), ?, 0 (row2),5 (row4),0 (row5),4 (row6),3 (row7),1 (row8). Existing numbers: 7,2,5,4,3,1. Missing are 6,8,9. But row2's missing are 5,6,7. Wait, row2's missing are 5,6,7? Wait, original missing after filling 2 and 4, the row2's missing numbers are 5,6,7. But column4's missing are 6,8,9. The intersection is 6. Therefore, row2, column4 must be 6. Let me check the block. The top-middle block (columns 3-5). Existing numbers are 1,7,8; 3,2,9; 4,6, ?. So adding 6 in column4 (row2) is okay. So row2, column4 is 6. Now row2 becomes [3,2,9,4,6, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Missing numbers are 5,7.\n\nNow column5 (row2, column5 is 0). Column5's existing numbers: 8 (row0),9 (row1), ?, 0 (row2),1 (row4),3 (row5),6 (row6),2 (row7),0 (row8). Existing numbers: 8,9,1,3,6,2. Missing are 4,5,7. Row2's missing are 5 and 7. So possible numbers here are 5 or 7. Let me check the block (top-middle). Existing numbers are 1,7,8; 3,2,9; 4,6, ?. Missing is 5. Therefore, this cell must be 5. So row2, column5 is 5. Now row2 is [3,2,9,4,6,5, 1, 0, 8]. Missing number is 7 in row2. The remaining zero is column7. Column7's existing numbers: 2 (row0),6 (row1), ?, 5 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),1 (row6),4 (row7),0 (row8). Existing numbers: 2,6,5,8,9,1,4. Missing are 3,7. Since row2's missing is 7, this cell must be 7. So row2, column7 is 7. Now row2 is [3,2,9,4,6,5,1,7,8]. Check for validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow moving to row3: [7, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0]. Missing numbers in row3: 1,2,3,4,9. Let's look for cells with only possibilities. Let's check each zero.\n\nFirst, column2 (row3, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 5 (row0),8 (row1),9 (row2),0 (row3),4 (row4),1 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),0 (row8). Existing numbers: 5,8,9,4,1. Missing are 2,3,6,7. Row3's missing are 1,2,3,4,9. The intersection is 2,3. Let me check the block. Row3 is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3: 7,8,0\nRow4: 2,0,4\nRow5: 6,0,1\n\nExisting numbers: 7,8,2,4,6,1. Missing are 3,5,9. But column2's possible numbers for this cell are 2,3. But the block's missing are 3,5,9. Therefore, the only possible is 3. So row3, column2 is 3. Now row3 becomes [7,8,3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0]. Missing numbers in row3 are 1,2,4,9.\n\nNext, column3 (row3, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: 1 (row0),3 (row1),4 (row2), ?, 6 (row4),0 (row5),9 (row6),8 (row7),5 (row8). Existing numbers: 1,3,4,6,9,8,5. Missing are 2,7. Row3's missing are 1,2,4,9. So possible numbers here are 2. Because 2 is in row's missing and column's missing. Let me check the block. Row3 is in the middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers:\n\nRow3: columns 3-5: 0, 0, 0\nRow4: columns 3-5: 6,5,1\nRow5: columns 3-5: 0, 0, 3.\n\nExisting numbers in this block: 6,5,1,3. Missing are 2,4,7,8,9. So possible numbers for row3, column3 is 2. Let me check if that's valid. Yes. So fill 2. Now row3 becomes [7,8,3,2, 0, 0, 6, 5, 0]. Missing numbers are 1,4,9.\n\nNow column4 (row3, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: 7 (row0),2 (row1),6 (row2), ?, 5 (row4),0 (row5),4 (row6),3 (row7),1 (row8). Existing numbers: 7,2,6,5,4,3,1. Missing are 8,9. But row3's missing are 1,4,9. So possible numbers here is 9. Let me check the block (middle-middle). Existing numbers include 6,5,1,3, and adding 9 here. The block's missing numbers include 9. So yes. So row3, column4 is 9. Now row3 becomes [7,8,3,2,9, 0, 6, 5, 0]. Missing numbers are 1 and 4.\n\nNow column5 (row3, column5 is 0). Column5's existing numbers: 8 (row0),9 (row1),5 (row2), ?, 1 (row4),3 (row5),6 (row6),2 (row7),0 (row8). Existing numbers: 8,9,5,1,3,6,2. Missing are 4,7. Row3's missing are 1,4. So possible is 4. Therefore, row3, column5 is 4. Now row3 becomes [7,8,3,2,9,4,6,5, 0]. Missing number is 1 in row3. The last zero is column8. Column8's existing numbers: 9 (row0),5 (row1),8 (row2),0 (row3),3 (row4),4 (row5),0 (row6),6 (row7),2 (row8). Existing numbers: 9,5,8,3,4,6,2. Missing are 1,7. Since row3's missing is 1, this cell must be 1. So row3 is [7,8,3,2,9,4,6,5,1]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow row4: [2, 0, 4, 6, 5, 1, 0, 8, 3]. Missing numbers are 7,9. Let's check the zeros. Column1 (row4, column1 is 0). Column1's existing numbers: 6 (row0),7 (row1),2 (row2),8 (row3), ?, 0 (row5),3 (row6),0 (row7),4 (row8). Existing numbers: 6,7,2,8,3,4. Missing are 1,5,9. Row4's missing are 7,9. The intersection is 9. Therefore, row4, column1 must be 9. Let me check the block. Row4 is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3: 7,8,3\nRow4: 2,9,4\nRow5: 6, ?, 1.\n\nExisting numbers: 7,8,3,2,4,6,1. Missing are 5. Wait, but row4's column1 is 9, which is not in the block's missing? Wait, the block is rows 3-5, columns 0-2. The existing numbers there are 7,8,3 (row3), 2,9,4 (row4), 6, ?, 1 (row5). So existing numbers include 7,8,3,2,4,6,1,9. Missing is 5. But row4, column1 is 9, which is already in the block. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, row4, column1 is in the middle-left block. If I put 9 there, but the block already has 9 in row4, column1? Or is there another 9 in the block? Let me check. The block's existing numbers before adding this 9 are 7,8,3 (row3), 2, ?, 4 (row4), 6, ?, 1 (row5). So no 9 yet. So adding 9 in row4, column1 is okay. Because the block didn't have a 9 before. So that's valid. So row4, column1 is 9. Now row4 becomes [2,9,4,6,5,1, 0, 8, 3]. Missing number is 7 in row4 (since row4's missing were 7 and 9, now 9 is filled). The remaining zero is column6. Column6's existing numbers: 3 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),6 (row3),0 (row4),2 (row5),0 (row6),0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing numbers: 3,4,1,6,2,8. Missing are 5,7,9. Since row4's missing is 7, this cell must be 7. So row4, column6 is 7. Now row4 is [2,9,4,6,5,1,7,8,3]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow row5: [6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 9, 4]. Missing numbers are 5,7,8. Let's check the zeros. Column1 (row5, column1 is 0). Column1's existing numbers: 6,7,2,8,9, ?, 3,0,4. Existing numbers: 6,7,2,8,9,3,4. Missing are 1,5. Row5's missing are 5,7,8. Intersection is 5. So possible. Let me check the block. Row5 is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: row3:7,8,3; row4:2,9,4; row5:6, ?, 1. Existing numbers: 7,8,3,2,9,4,6,1. Missing is 5. Therefore, row5, column1 must be 5. So fill that. Now row5 becomes [6,5,1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 9, 4]. Missing numbers are 7,8.\n\nNow columns 3 and 4 (row5, columns 3 and 4). Let's check column3 (row5, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: 1,3,4,2,6, ?,9,8,5. Existing numbers: 1,3,4,2,6,9,8,5. Missing is 7. Therefore, row5, column3 must be 7. Then column4 (row5, column4 is 0) would be 8. Let me check. \n\nRow5's missing are 7 and 8. Column3's missing is 7. So row5, column3 is 7. Then column4 (row5, column4) would be 8. Let me check the block. The middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers:\n\nRow3: 2,9,4\nRow4:6,5,1\nRow5:7, ?, 3.\n\nSo existing numbers: 2,9,4,6,5,1,7,3. Missing is 8. Therefore, row5, column4 must be 8. So row5 becomes [6,5,1,7,8,3,2,9,4]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow row6: [0, 3, 0, 9, 4, 6, 0, 1, 0]. Missing numbers in row6: 2,5,7,8. Let's look for cells with only possibilities.\n\nFirst, column0 (row6, column0 is 0). Column0's existing numbers: 4 (row0),1 (row1),3 (row2),7 (row3),2 (row4),6 (row5), ?, 5 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing numbers: 4,1,3,7,2,6,5. Missing are 8,9. But row6's missing are 2,5,7,8. The intersection is 8. Therefore, row6, column0 must be 8. Let me check the block. Row6 is in the bottom-left block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2). Existing numbers:\n\nRow6: 8,3, ?\nRow7:5, ?, ?\nRow8: ?,4, ?\n\nExisting numbers: 8,3,5,4. Missing are 1,2,6,7,9. But column0's cell is 8, which is okay. Now, row6 becomes [8,3, 0, 9, 4, 6, 0, 1, 0]. Missing numbers are 2,5,7.\n\nNow column2 (row6, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 5 (row0),8 (row1),9 (row2),3 (row3),4 (row4),1 (row5), ?, 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing numbers: 5,8,9,3,4,1. Missing are 2,6,7. Row6's missing are 2,5,7. So possible numbers here are 2,7. Let me check the block (bottom-left). Existing numbers in the block: 8,3 (row6), 5 (row7, column0?), etc. Wait, the block is rows 6-8, columns 0-2. Let me check existing numbers:\n\nRow6: 8,3, ?\nRow7:5, 0, 0\nRow8: ?,4, ?\n\nExisting numbers: 8,3,5,4. Missing are 1,2,6,7,9. So for row6, column2, possible numbers are 2,7. Let me check column2. Also, check the row's missing. Let me see if there's another way. Let's check other cells first.\n\nLooking at column6 (row6, column6 is 0). Column6's existing numbers: 3 (row0),4 (row1),1 (row2),6 (row3),7 (row4),2 (row5), ?, 0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing numbers: 3,4,1,6,7,2,8. Missing are 5,9. Row6's missing are 2,5,7. So possible here is 5. Let me check if that's valid. If column6's missing are 5 and 9, and row6's missing includes 5, then possible. Let me check the block. The bottom-middle block (rows 6-8, columns 6-8). Existing numbers:\n\nRow6: ?,1, ?\nRow7: ?,4,6\nRow8: 8, ?, 2.\n\nExisting numbers: 1,4,6,8,2. Missing are 3,5,7,9. So if row6, column6 is 5, that's okay. Let me see if there are constraints elsewhere. Let's see if there's another cell in row6 that can be filled.\n\nLooking at column8 (row6, column8 is 0). Column8's existing numbers: 9 (row0),5 (row1),8 (row2),1 (row3),3 (row4),4 (row5), ?, 6 (row7),2 (row8). Existing numbers: 9,5,8,1,3,4,6,2. Missing is 7. Therefore, row6, column8 must be 7. Because column8's missing is 7. Since row6's missing includes 7, this is valid. So fill 7 in row6, column8. Now row6 becomes [8,3, 0, 9, 4, 6, 0, 1,7]. Missing numbers are 2 and 5.\n\nNow, column6 (row6, column6 is 0). Column6's missing are 5 and 9. But row6's missing are 2 and 5. So possible here is 5. Therefore, row6, column6 is 5. Now row6 becomes [8,3, 0, 9, 4, 6, 5, 1,7]. Missing number is 2 in row6. The remaining zero is column2. So row6, column2 must be 2. Now row6 is [8,3,2,9,4,6,5,1,7]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow row7: [5, 0, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 4, 6]. Missing numbers are 1,7,9. Let's look for cells with only possibilities.\n\nFirst, column1 (row7, column1 is 0). Column1's existing numbers: 6,7,2,8,9,5,3, ?,4. Existing numbers: 6,7,2,8,9,5,3,4. Missing is 1. Therefore, row7, column1 must be 1. Let me check the block. Row7 is in the bottom-left block (rows 6-8, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: row6:8,3,2; row7:5,1, ?; row8: ?,4, ?. Existing numbers: 8,3,2,5,1. Missing are 6,7,9. But column1's cell is 1, which is okay. Now row7 becomes [5,1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 0, 4, 6]. Missing numbers are 7,9.\n\nNow column2 (row7, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 5,8,9,3,4,1,2, ?, ?. Existing numbers: 5,8,9,3,4,1,2. Missing are 6,7. Row7's missing are 7,9. So possible is 7. Let me check the block (bottom-left). Existing numbers in block: 8,3,2 (row6), 5,1, ? (row7), ?,4, ? (row8). Missing are 6,7,9. So if this cell is 7, that's okay. Also, column2's missing are 6,7. So possible. Let me check if there's another constraint. Let's look at column6 (row7, column6 is 0). Column6's existing numbers: 3,4,1,6,7,2,5, ?,8. Existing numbers: 3,4,1,6,7,2,5,8. Missing is 9. Therefore, row7, column6 must be 9. Because column6's missing is 9. Since row7's missing are 7 and 9, this is valid. So fill 9 in row7, column6. Now row7 becomes [5,1, 0, 8, 3, 2, 9, 4, 6]. Missing number is 7 in row7. The remaining zero is column2. So row7, column2 is 7. Now row7 is [5,1,7,8,3,2,9,4,6]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good.\n\nNow row8: [0, 4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8, 0, 2]. Missing numbers are 3,6,7,9. Let's look for cells with only possibilities.\n\nFirst, column0 (row8, column0 is 0). Column0's existing numbers: 4,1,3,7,2,6,8,5, ?. Existing numbers: 4,1,3,7,2,6,8,5. Missing is 9. Therefore, row8, column0 must be 9. Let me check the block (bottom-left). Existing numbers: row6:8,3,2; row7:5,1,7; row8:9,4, ?. Existing numbers: 8,3,2,5,1,7,9,4. Missing is 6. So row8, column0 is 9, which is okay. Now row8 becomes [9,4, 0, 5, 1, 0, 8, 0, 2]. Missing numbers are 3,6,7.\n\nNow column2 (row8, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 5,8,9,3,4,1,2,7, ?. Existing numbers: 5,8,9,3,4,1,2,7. Missing is 6. Therefore, row8, column2 must be 6. Now row8 becomes [9,4,6,5,1, 0, 8, 0, 2]. Missing numbers are 3,7.\n\nNow column5 (row8, column5 is 0). Column5's existing numbers: 8,9,5,4,1,3,6,2, ?. Existing numbers: 8,9,5,4,1,3,6,2. Missing is 7. Therefore, row8, column5 must be 7. Now row8 becomes [9,4,6,5,1,7,8, 0, 2]. Missing number is 3 in column7 (row8, column7). Column7's existing numbers: 2 (row0),6 (row1),7 (row2),5 (row3),8 (row4),9 (row5),1 (row6),4 (row7), ?. Existing numbers: 2,6,7,5,8,9,1,4. Missing is 3. Therefore, row8, column7 is 3. Now row8 is [9,4,6,5,1,7,8,3,2]. Check validity. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates.

      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where the zeros are and what numbers can go there. Each row, column, and 3x3 block must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition.\n\nStarting with the first row, which is all zeros. That's going to be tricky because there's nothing there. Maybe I should look for rows or columns with more filled numbers first to find possible candidates.\n\nLooking at row 2: [0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 0, 4, 3]. Let's see. The existing numbers are 9,2,7,4,3. Missing are 1,5,6,8. Let's check each empty cell. The first cell (row 2, column 1). The column 1 has 9,2,6,5 in rows 3,4,6,8. Wait, row 2 column 1 is in column 1. Let me check column 1. Column 1's numbers are: row 1:0, row2:0, row3:9, row4:2, row5:0, row6:6, row7:0, row8:5, row9:0. So existing numbers in column 1 are 9,2,6,5. So possible numbers for row2 column1 could be 1,3,4,7,8. But in row2, the existing numbers are 9,2,7,4,3. So the missing in row2 are 1,5,6,8. So the cell (2,1) must be a number not in column 1 (excluding existing) and not in row 2's existing. Let's see. So possible numbers for (2,1) are 1,5,8? Because column 1 has 9,2,6,5. So 5 is already in column 1 (row8). So 5 can't be in column1. So possible numbers are 1,8. Also, check the 3x3 block. Row2 is in the top-middle block (rows 1-3, columns 4-6?), wait no. Wait, Sudoku blocks are divided into 3x3. Let me think. The blocks are:\n\nRows 1-3, columns 1-3; rows 1-3, columns 4-6; rows 1-3, columns 7-9.\n\nRow2, column1 is in the first block (rows 1-3, columns 1-3). Let's check existing numbers in that block. The first block includes rows 1,2,3 and columns 1,2,3. Row1 is all zeros. Row2 has zeros in columns 1-3. Row3 has 9,2,0 in columns 1-3. So existing numbers are 9 and 2. So possible numbers for (2,1) are 1,3,4,5,6,7,8. But considering row2 and column1 constraints, possible numbers are 1,8. Let me see. Maybe there's another cell in row2 that's easier.\n\nLooking at row2, column7 (which is 0). The column7 has numbers: row1:0, row2:0, row3:1, row4:6, row5:2, row6:4, row7:0, row8:0, row9:7. So existing in column7: 1,6,2,4,7. Missing are 3,5,8,9. For row2, column7, the row2 has existing numbers 9,2,7,4,3. So missing in row2 are 1,5,6,8. Wait, but column7's missing are 3,5,8,9. So the intersection is 5,8. Also, check the block. The block for row2, column7 is the top-right block (rows 1-3, columns 7-9). Existing numbers in that block: row2 columns 7-9 are 0,4,3. Row3 columns 7-9: 1,0,5. So existing numbers are 4,3,1,5. So possible numbers for (2,7) are 2,6,7,8,9? Wait no, the block is rows 1-3, columns 7-9. Let me check what's there. Row2's columns 7 is 0, 8 is 4, 9 is 3. Row3's columns 7 is 1, 8 is 0, 9 is 5. So existing in the block are 4,3,1,5. So possible numbers for (2,7) are 2,6,7,8,9. But considering row2's missing numbers (1,5,6,8) and column7's missing (3,5,8,9), the possible numbers for (2,7) must be in both row2's missing and column7's missing. So row2's missing in row2 is 1,5,6,8. Column7's missing is 3,5,8,9. So the intersection is 5,8. Also, the block's possible numbers (since existing in block are 1,4,3,5). So possible numbers for (2,7) are 2,6,7,8,9. But since the cell must be in the intersection of row, column, and block. So possible numbers are 5 and 8? Wait 5 is already in the block (row3 column7 is 1, but 5 is in row3 column9? Wait row3's column9 is 5. So the block (top-right) includes 5. So 5 is already present. So (2,7) can't be 5. So possible is only 8. Because 5 is already in the block. Therefore, (2,7) must be 8. Let me check again. If (2,7) is 8, then in row2, 8 is added. In column7, 8 is added. In the block, 8 is added. That works. So I can fill 8 in (2,7). \n\nSo row2 becomes [0, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3]. Now, let's look at row2 again. Now, the missing numbers in row2 are 1,5,6. Let's check column1 (row2, column1). Column1's existing numbers are 9,2,6,5. So possible for (2,1) are 1,3,4,7,8. But row2's missing are 1,5,6. So only 1 is possible? Because 5 and 6 are already in column1 (row8 has 5, row6 has 6). So (2,1) must be 1? Wait, column1 has 9 (row3), 2 (row4), 6 (row6), 5 (row8). So 1 is not present. So yes, (2,1) can be 1. Let me check the block. The first block (rows 1-3, columns 1-3). Existing numbers are 9 (row3, col1), 2 (row3, col2). So adding 1 in (2,1) is okay. So yes, 1 is possible. So fill (2,1) with 1. Now row2 is [1, 0, 0, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3]. Now, the remaining missing in row2 are 5 and 6. Let's look at (2,2) and (2,3). \n\nLooking at column2 for (2,2). Column2 has existing numbers: row3:2, row4:7, row5:3, row6:5, row8:0, row9:1. Wait, let me list column2:\n\nRow1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:7, row5:3, row6:5, row7:0, row8:0, row9:1. So existing numbers are 2,7,3,5,1. Missing are 4,6,8,9. For row2, missing are 5 and 6. Wait row2's missing numbers are 5 and 6 (since existing in row2 are 1,9,2,7,8,4,3). So row2 needs 5 and 6. But column2's missing are 4,6,8,9. So the intersection is 6. Therefore, (2,2) must be 6? Or (2,3) must be 5 or 6? Let me check. \n\nIf row2's missing are 5 and 6, and column2's missing includes 6, then (2,2) could be 6. Let's check the block. The first block (rows1-3, columns1-3). Existing numbers are 1 (row2, col1), 9 (row3, col1), 2 (row3, col2). So adding 6 in (2,2) would be okay. Let's check if 6 is allowed in column2. Column2 doesn't have 6 yet. So yes. Then (2,2) is 6. Then (2,3) would need to be 5. Let me check column3. Column3: row1:0, row2:0 (now 5?), row3:0, row4:0, row5:1, row6:0, row7:4, row8:0, row9:0. So existing numbers in column3 are 1 and 4. So 5 is allowed. Also, the block (first block) would have 1,6, and then 5 in (2,3). That's okay. So row2 becomes [1,6,5,9,2,7,8,4,3]. Let me check if this is valid. Each number in row2 is unique. Yes. Column checks: column1 has 1, column2 has 6, column3 has 5. All okay. Block checks: first block has 1,6,5,9,2. All unique. Okay.\n\nNow moving on. Let's check row3: [9, 2, 0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 0, 5]. The existing numbers are 9,2,4,3,1,5. Missing are 6,7,8. Let's look at the empty cells: (3,3), (3,4), (3,8). Let's check (3,3). Column3 has existing numbers: 5 (from row2), 1 (row5), 4 (row7). So missing in column3 are 2,3,6,7,8,9? Wait original column3 numbers: let me check again. Column3:\n\nRow1:0, row2:5, row3:0, row4:0, row5:1, row6:0, row7:4, row8:0, row9:0. So existing are 5,1,4. So missing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. But row3's missing are 6,7,8. So possible numbers for (3,3) are 6,7,8. Also, check the block. (3,3) is in the first block (rows1-3, columns1-3). Existing numbers in the block: row1: all zeros except maybe, row2 has 1,6,5; row3 has 9,2, and (3,3). So existing numbers are 1,6,5,9,2. So missing in the block are 3,4,7,8. Therefore, possible for (3,3) is 7 or 8? Because row3's missing are 6,7,8. Wait column3's possible for (3,3) is 6,7,8. But the block's possible are 3,4,7,8. So the intersection is 7,8. So (3,3) can be 7 or 8. Let's see if there's another way. Let's look at row3's column8 (which is 0). Column8 has existing numbers: row1:0, row2:4, row3:0, row4:0, row5:7, row6:0, row7:9, row8:1, row9:8. So existing are 4,7,9,1,8. Missing are 2,3,5,6. But row3's missing are 6,7,8. Wait row3's missing are 6,7,8. Column8's missing are 2,3,5,6. So intersection is 6. Therefore, (3,8) must be 6. Because row3 needs 6,7,8 and column8 needs 6. So (3,8) is 6. Now row3 becomes [9,2,0,0,4,3,1,6,5]. Now row3's missing are 7 and 8. Let's check (3,3) and (3,4). \n\nFor (3,3): column3's possible are 6,7,8. But row3's missing are 7,8. Also, the block's possible are 7,8. So (3,3) can be 7 or 8. Let's check column4. (3,4) is in column4. Column4 has existing numbers: row2:9, row3:0, row4:0, row5:6, row6:2, row7:3, row8:0, row9:0. Existing numbers are 9,6,2,3. Missing are 1,4,5,7,8. Row3's missing for (3,4) are 7 or 8. Let me see. Also, the block for (3,4) is the middle-top block (rows1-3, columns4-6). Existing numbers in that block: row2 columns4-6:9,2,7; row3 columns4-6: 0,4,3. So existing numbers are 9,2,7,4,3. Missing are 1,5,6,8. So (3,4) must be one of 1,5,6,8. But row3's missing for (3,4) is part of 7 or 8. Wait row3's missing are 7 and 8. But in the block, (3,4) can only be 8. Because 7 is already in the block (row2, column6 is 7). Therefore, (3,4) must be 8. Then (3,3) would be 7. Let me check. If (3,4) is 8, then row3's missing are 7 and 8. So (3,4) is 8, then (3,3) must be 7. Let's check column3: adding 7 to column3. Column3's existing numbers are 5,1,4. 7 is not present, so okay. Block also okay. So row3 becomes [9,2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5]. Now check row3: all numbers 1-9 with no duplicates. Yes. \n\nNow, let's move to row4: [2, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 9]. Existing numbers are 2,7,1,6,9. Missing are 3,4,5,8. Let's check each empty cell. The cells are (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,8). Let's start with (4,8). Column8 has existing numbers: row2:4, row3:6, row4:0, row5:7, row6:0, row7:9, row8:1, row9:8. So existing are 4,6,7,9,1,8. Missing are 2,3,5. But row4's missing are 3,4,5,8. So intersection is 3,5. Therefore, (4,8) can be 3 or 5. Let's check the block. (4,8) is in the middle-right block (rows4-6, columns7-9). Existing numbers in that block: row4 columns7-9:6,0,9; row5 columns7-9:2,7,0; row6 columns7-9:4,0,0. So existing are 6,9,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3,5,8. So possible for (4,8) are 3,5. Let's see if there's another way. Let's check row4's column5 (which is 0). Column5: existing numbers are row2:2, row3:4, row4:0, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:8, row9:0. So existing are 2,4,8. Missing are 1,3,5,6,7,9. Row4's missing in row are 3,4,5,8. But column5's missing includes 3,5. So maybe possible. Not sure yet. Let's try another cell. \n\nLooking at (4,3). Column3 has existing numbers: row2:5, row3:7, row5:1, row7:4. So existing are 5,7,1,4. Missing are 2,3,6,8,9. But row4's missing are 3,4,5,8. So for (4,3), possible numbers are 3,8. Because row4's missing includes 3 and 8. Let me check the block. (4,3) is in the middle-middle block (rows4-6, columns1-3). Existing numbers in that block: row4:2,7,0; row5:0,3,1; row6:6,5,0. So existing numbers are 2,7,3,1,6,5. Missing are 4,8,9. So (4,3) must be 8? Because row4's possible for (4,3) is 3,8. But block's missing are 4,8,9. So only 8 is common. Therefore, (4,3) is 8. Now row4 becomes [2,7,8, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 9]. Now row4's missing are 3,4,5. Let's check (4,4) and (4,5). \n\nFor (4,4): column4. Column4's existing numbers are row2:9, row3:8, row4:0, row5:6, row6:2, row7:3, row8:0, row9:0. Existing are 9,8,6,2,3. Missing are 1,4,5,7. Row4's missing are 3,4,5. So intersection is 4,5. Also, check the block. (4,4) is in the middle-middle block (rows4-6, columns4-6). Existing numbers in that block: row4:0,0,1; row5:6,0,9; row6:2,0,0. Existing numbers are 6,9,2,1. Missing are 3,4,5,7,8. So possible for (4,4) are 4,5. Let me check if there are other constraints. Let's look at row4's column5. For (4,5): column5's existing numbers are 2,4,8. Missing are 1,3,5,6,7,9. Row4's missing are 3,4,5. So possible for (4,5) are 3,5. Also, block's missing for (4,5) (middle-middle block) are 3,4,5,7,8. So possible numbers are 3,5. \n\nLet me see if there's a way to determine which is which. Let's look at row4's column4 and column5. Let's think about possible numbers. \n\nIf (4,4) is 4, then (4,5) could be 3 or 5. If (4,4) is 5, then (4,5) could be 3 or something else. Let's check other cells. \n\nLooking at row5: [0, 3, 1, 6, 0, 9, 2, 7, 0]. Existing numbers are 3,1,6,9,2,7. Missing are 4,5,8. Let's check row5's column1 (0). Column1 has existing numbers: row2:1, row3:9, row4:2, row6:6, row8:5, row9:0. So existing are 1,9,2,6,5. Missing are 3,4,7,8. But row5's missing are 4,5,8. So possible for (5,1) is 4,8. Also, check the block (middle-left block, rows4-6, columns1-3). Existing numbers in that block: row4:2,7,8; row5:0,3,1; row6:6,5,0. Existing are 2,7,8,3,1,6,5. Missing are 4,9. So (5,1) must be 4 or 9. But row5's missing are 4,5,8. So only 4 is possible. Therefore, (5,1) is 4. Now row5 becomes [4, 3, 1, 6, 0, 9, 2, 7, 0]. Now row5's missing are 5,8. \n\nNow, looking at row5's column5 (which is 0). Column5's existing numbers are 2,4,8 (from row2, row3, row8?), let me check again. Column5: row2:2, row3:4, row4: ?, row5:0, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8:8, row9: ?. So existing are 2,4,8. Missing are 1,3,5,6,7,9. Row5's missing are 5,8. But column5 already has 8, so (5,5) can't be 8. So (5,5) must be 5. Let me check. Yes. Adding 5 to row5's column5. Now row5 becomes [4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7,0]. Now row5's missing is 8 in column9. So (5,9) is 8. Now row5 is [4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8]. Check if valid. Yes. \n\nNow back to row4. Now that row5's column5 is 5, let's see. For row4's column5 (which is 0). Column5 has existing numbers 2,4,5,8. Missing are 1,3,6,7,9. Row4's missing are 3,4,5. But row4's missing after filling (4,3) as 8 are 3,4,5. Wait row4 is [2,7,8, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 9]. Existing numbers are 2,7,8,1,6,9. Missing are 3,4,5. Now, column5 for (4,5) is 0. Column5's existing are 2,4,5,8. So row4's (4,5) can't be 4 or 5. So only possible is 3. Therefore, (4,5) is 3. Now row4 becomes [2,7,8, 0, 3, 1, 6, 0, 9]. Now row4's missing are 4 and 5. \n\nNow, (4,4) is 0. Column4's existing are 9,8,6,2,3. So missing are 1,4,5,7. Row4's missing are 4 and 5. So (4,4) can be 4 or 5. Let's check the block. Middle-middle block (rows4-6, columns4-6). Existing numbers in that block: row4:0,3,1; row5:6,5,9; row6:2,0,0. Existing are 6,5,9,2,3,1. Missing are 4,7,8. So (4,4) can be 4 or 7 or 8? But row4's missing are 4 and 5. So only 4 is possible. Therefore, (4,4) is 4. Now row4 becomes [2,7,8,4,3,1,6, 0,9]. Now row4's missing is 5 in (4,8). So (4,8) is 5. Now row4 is [2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9]. Check validity. Yes. \n\nNow, moving to row6: [6, 5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]. Existing numbers are 6,5,2,4. Missing are 1,3,7,8,9. Let's check each cell. \n\nFirst, let's look at (6,3). Column3 has existing numbers: row2:5, row3:7, row4:8, row5:1, row7:4, row9: ?. Existing are 5,7,8,1,4. Missing are 2,3,6,9. But row6's missing are 1,3,7,8,9. So possible for (6,3) is 3,9. Also, check the block. (6,3) is in the middle-left block (rows4-6, columns1-3). Existing numbers in that block: row4:2,7,8; row5:4,3,1; row6:6,5, ?. Existing are 2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5. Missing are 9. So (6,3) must be 9. Therefore, (6,3) is 9. Now row6 becomes [6,5,9,2,0,0,4,0,0]. Missing are 1,3,7,8. \n\nNow, let's look at (6,5) and (6,6). Let's check column5 for (6,5). Column5's existing are 2,4,5,8,3 (from row4's column5 is 3). Wait row4's column5 is 3. So column5 has 2,4,5,8,3. Missing are 1,6,7,9. Row6's missing are 1,3,7,8. So possible for (6,5) is 1,7. Also, check the block (middle-middle block, rows4-6, columns4-6). Existing numbers: row4:4,3,1; row5:6,5,9; row6:2, ?, ?. Existing are 4,3,1,6,5,9,2. Missing are 7,8. So (6,5) and (6,6) must be 7 and 8. \n\nLooking at row6's column5 (0) and column6 (0). Let's check column6. Column6 has existing numbers: row2:7, row3:3, row4:1, row5:9, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8: ?, row9:2. Existing are 7,3,1,9,2. Missing are 4,5,6,8. But row6's missing in row are 1,3,7,8. So for (6,6), possible numbers are 8 (since column6's missing includes 8). Let me think. \n\nIn the middle-middle block, (6,5) and (6,6) must be 7 and 8. Let's check column5 for (6,5). Column5's existing are 2,4,5,8,3. So if (6,5) is 7, then column5 allows it. Column6's (6,6) would be 8. Let me check column6 for 8. Column6 doesn't have 8 yet. So possible. Let's check if there are other constraints. \n\nLooking at row6's column9 (0). Column9 has existing numbers: row2:3, row3:5, row4:9, row5:8, row9:4. Existing are 3,5,9,8,4. Missing are 1,2,6,7. Row6's missing in row are 1,3,7,8. So (6,9) could be 1 or 7. Not sure yet. Let's proceed. \n\nAssume (6,5) is 7 and (6,6) is 8. Then row6 becomes [6,5,9,2,7,8,4,0,0]. Now missing are 1 and 3 in row6. Let's check (6,8) and (6,9). \n\nFor (6,8): column8 has existing numbers: row2:4, row3:6, row4:5, row5:7, row6:0, row7:9, row8:1, row9:8. Existing are 4,6,5,7,9,1,8. Missing are 2,3. Row6's missing are 1 and 3. So (6,8) must be 3. Then (6,9) is 1. Let me check column9 for (6,9): 1 is allowed. So row6 becomes [6,5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1]. Check validity. Yes. \n\nNow, let's check if this works. Column5 now has 7 added, which is okay. Column6 has 8 added, okay. Block middle-middle has 7 and 8 added, okay. \n\nNow moving to row7: [0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0]. Existing numbers are 4,3,6,9. Missing are 1,2,5,7,8. Let's check each cell. \n\nLet's look at (7,1) and (7,2). Column1 has existing numbers: row2:1, row3:9, row4:2, row5:4, row6:6, row7:0, row8:5, row9: ?. Existing are 1,9,2,4,6,5. Missing are 3,7,8. So (7,1) can be 3,7,8. But row7's missing are 1,2,5,7,8. So possible for (7,1) are 7,8. Also, check the block (bottom-left block, rows7-9, columns1-3). Existing numbers in that block: row7:0,0,4; row8:5,0,0; row9:0,1,0. Existing are 4,5,1. Missing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. So (7,1) can be 7,8. Let's see if there's another way. \n\nLooking at (7,5) which is 0. Column5 has existing numbers 2,4,5,8,3,7 (from row6). So column5's existing are 2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing are 1,6,9. Row7's missing are 1,2,5,7,8. So (7,5) must be 1, since that's the only common. Therefore, (7,5) is 1. Now row7 becomes [0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 6, 0, 9, 0]. Now row7's missing are 2,5,7,8. \n\nNow check (7,7) and (7,9). Column7 has existing numbers: row2:8, row3:1, row4:6, row5:2, row6:4, row7:0, row8:0, row9:7. Existing are 8,1,6,2,4,7. Missing are 3,5,9. Row7's missing for (7,7) are 2,5,7,8. So intersection is 5. Therefore, (7,7) must be 5. Now row7 becomes [0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 0]. Now row7's missing are 2,7,8. \n\nLooking at (7,9). Column9 has existing numbers: row2:3, row3:5, row4:9, row5:8, row6:1, row7:0, row8:0, row9:4. Existing are 3,5,9,8,1,4. Missing are 2,6,7. Row7's missing are 2,7,8. So (7,9) can be 2 or 7. Also, check the block (bottom-right block, rows7-9, columns7-9). Existing numbers: row7:5,9,0; row8:0,1,0; row9:7,8,4. Existing are 5,9,1,7,8,4. Missing are 2,3,6. So (7,9) must be 2 or 6? But row7's missing for (7,9) is 2 or 7. But block's missing are 2,3,6. So only 2 is possible. Therefore, (7,9) is 2. Now row7 becomes [0, 0, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2]. Now row7's missing are 7 and 8. \n\nNow looking at (7,1) and (7,2). Row7's missing are 7 and 8. Column1's existing are 1,9,2,4,6,5. Missing are 3,7,8. So (7,1) can be 7 or 8. Similarly for (7,2). Let's check the block (bottom-left block). Existing numbers are 4 (row7,3), 5 (row8,1), 1 (row9,2). Missing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. But row7's missing are 7 and 8. Let's see if there's another constraint. \n\nLooking at row8: [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Let's see if we can find something there. But maybe it's easier to look at row7's (7,1) and (7,2). \n\nFor (7,1): column1's missing are 3,7,8. Row7's missing are 7,8. So possible 7 or 8. Let's check column7. Wait, no. Let me think. Also, check column2 for (7,2). Column2's existing are row2:6, row3:2, row4:7, row5:3, row6:5, row7:0, row8:0, row9:1. Existing are 6,2,7,3,5,1. Missing are 4,8,9. Row7's missing for (7,2) is 7 or 8. But column2's missing are 4,8,9. So only 8 is possible. Therefore, (7,2) must be 8. Then (7,1) must be 7. Let me check. \n\nIf (7,2) is 8, then column2 has 8 added. Block (bottom-left) now has 8 in (7,2). Then (7,1) would be 7. Column1 allows 7 (not present yet). So row7 becomes [7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2]. Check validity. Yes. \n\nNow row7 is filled. Now moving to row8: [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Existing numbers are 5,8,1. Missing are 2,3,4,6,7,9. Let's check each cell. \n\nLooking at (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), (8,6), (8,7), (8,9). Let's start with (8,9). Column9 has existing numbers: 3,5,9,8,1,2,4. Missing are 6,7. Row8's missing are 2,3,4,6,7,9. So (8,9) can be 6 or 7. Let's check the block (bottom-right block, rows7-9, columns7-9). Existing are row7:5,9,2; row8:0,1,0; row9:7,8,4. Existing are 5,9,2,1,7,8,4. Missing are 3,6. So (8,9) must be 6 or 3. But column9's missing are 6,7. So only 6 is possible. Therefore, (8,9) is 6. Now row8 becomes [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 6]. Now row8's missing are 2,3,4,7,9. \n\nLooking at (8,7). Column7 has existing numbers: 8 (row2),1 (row3),6 (row4),2 (row5),4 (row6),5 (row7),0 (row8),0 (row9). Existing are 8,1,6,2,4,5. Missing are 3,7,9. Row8's missing for (8,7) are 2,3,4,7,9. So possible are 3,7,9. Also, check block (bottom-right). Missing in block are 3,6 (but 6 is added to row8,9). Now block's missing are 3. Wait no, after adding 6 to (8,9), block has 5,9,2,1,6,7,8,4. Missing is 3. So (8,7) must be 3. Because in the block, only 3 is missing. Therefore, (8,7) is 3. Now row8 becomes [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 1, 6]. Now row8's missing are 2,4,7,9. \n\nLooking at (8,6). Column6 has existing numbers: row2:7, row3:3, row4:1, row5:9, row6:8, row7:6, row8:0, row9:2. Existing are 7,3,1,9,8,6,2. Missing are 4,5. Row8's missing for (8,6) are 2,4,7,9. So possible is 4. Therefore, (8,6) is 4. Now row8 becomes [5, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6]. Now row8's missing are 2,7,9. \n\nLooking at (8,4). Column4 has existing numbers: row2:9, row3:8, row4:4, row5:6, row6:2, row7:3, row8:0, row9:0. Existing are 9,8,4,6,2,3. Missing are 1,5,7. Row8's missing are 2,7,9. So possible for (8,4) is 7. Therefore, (8,4) is 7. Now row8 becomes [5, 0, 0, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6]. Now row8's missing are 2 and 9. \n\nLooking at (8,2) and (8,3). Let's check column2 for (8,2). Column2 has existing numbers: 6,2,7,3,5,8,1. Missing are 4,9. Row8's missing are 2,9. So (8,2) can be 9. Because 2 is already present in column2 (row3). So (8,2) must be 9. Then (8,3) is 2. Let me check. \n\nFor (8,2): column2's existing are 6,2,7,3,5,8,1. Adding 9 is okay. Row8's missing are 2 and 9. So if (8,2) is 9, then (8,3) must be 2. Check column3: existing numbers are 5 (row2),7 (row3),8 (row4),1 (row5),9 (row6),4 (row7),0 (row8), etc. Adding 2 to column3 is okay. Also, check the block (bottom-left block). Existing numbers in that block: row7:7,8,4; row8:5,9,2; row9: ?,1, ?. So adding 9 and 2 is okay. So row8 becomes [5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1,6]. Check validity. Yes. \n\nNow, row8 is filled. Now moving to row9: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 7, 8, 4]. Existing numbers are 1,2,7,8,4. Missing are 3,5,6,9. Let's check each cell. \n\nLooking at (9,1), (9,3), (9,4), (9,5). Let's start with (9,1). Column1 has existing numbers: 1,9,2,4,6,5,7. Missing are 3,8. Row9's missing are 3,5,6,9. So possible for (9,1) is 3. Because 8 is not in row9's missing. Wait row9's missing are 3,5,6,9. Column1's missing are 3,8. So only 3 is possible. Therefore, (9,1) is 3. Now row9 becomes [3,1,0,0,0,2,7,8,4]. Now missing are 5,6,9. \n\nLooking at (9,3). Column3 has existing numbers: 5,7,8,1,9,4,2. Missing are 3,6. But row9's missing are 5,6,9. So possible for (9,3) is 6. Because column3 is missing 3 and 6. But row9's missing includes 6. So (9,3) is 6. Now row9 becomes [3,1,6,0,0,2,7,8,4]. Missing are 5,9. \n\nNow looking at (9,4) and (9,5). Column4 has existing numbers: 9,8,4,6,2,3,7. Missing are 1,5. Row9's missing are 5,9. So (9,4) can be 5 or 9? Wait column4's missing are 1,5. So only 5 is possible. Therefore, (9,4) is 5. Now row9 becomes [3,1,6,5,0,2,7,8,4]. Missing is 9 in (9,5). So (9,5) is 9. Now row9 is [3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8,4]. Check validity. Yes. \n\nNow, let's check the entire board for any errors. Let me go through each row, column, and block.\n\nRow1 is still all zeros. Wait, but I haven't filled row1 yet. Oh no! I completely forgot about row1. Let me check. \n\nThe current filled rows are:\n\nRow1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow2: [1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3]\n\nRow3: [9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5]\n\nRow4: [2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9]\n\nRow5: [4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8]\n\nRow6: [6,5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1]\n\nRow7: [7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2]\n\nRow8: [5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1,6]\n\nRow9: [3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8,4]\n\nNow, need to fill row1. Let's do that. \n\nRow1 is all zeros. Let's look at each cell. \n\nLet's check column by column. \n\nFor row1, column1: existing in column1 are 1,9,2,4,6,5,7,3. Missing is 8. So (1,1) must be 8. \n\nNow row1 becomes [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nNow check column2 for row1. Column2 has existing numbers: 6,2,7,3,5,8,1,9. Missing is 4. So (1,2) must be 4. \n\nRow1: [8,4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nNow column3: existing numbers are 5,7,8,1,9,4,2,6. Missing is 3. So (1,3) must be 3. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nNow column4: existing numbers are 9,8,4,6,2,3,7,5. Missing is 1. So (1,4) must be 1. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3,1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nColumn5: existing numbers are 2,4,5,3,7,1,9,8. Missing is 6. So (1,5) must be 6. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3,1,6, 0, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nColumn6: existing numbers are 7,3,1,9,8,6,2. Missing are 4,5. Let's check row1's column6. Row1's current numbers are 8,4,3,1,6. Missing in row1 are 2,5,7,9? No, wait row1 is [8,4,3,1,6, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Existing numbers are 8,4,3,1,6. Missing are 2,5,7,9. But column6's existing are 7,3,1,9,8,6,2. Wait column6 has row2:7, row3:3, row4:1, row5:9, row6:8, row7:6, row8:4, row9:2. So existing are 7,3,1,9,8,6,4,2. Missing is 5. Therefore, (1,6) must be 5. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3,1,6,5, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nNow column7: existing numbers are 8,1,6,2,4,5,3,7. Missing is 9. So (1,7) must be 9. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3,1,6,5,9, 0, 0]. \n\nColumn8: existing numbers are 4,6,5,7,3,1,9,8. Missing is 2. So (1,8) must be 2. \n\nRow1: [8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2, 0]. \n\nColumn9: existing numbers are 3,5,9,8,1,2,4,6. Missing is 7. So (1,9) must be 7. \n\nFinal row1: [8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7]. \n\nNow check if this row is valid. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Yes. \n\nNow let's check all rows, columns, and blocks for validity. \n\nFor example, check row1: 8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7 – all unique. \n\nRow2: 1,6,5,9,2,7,8,4,3 – unique. \n\nRow3: 9,2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5 – unique. \n\nRow4: 2,7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9 – unique. \n\nRow5: 4,3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8 – unique. \n\nRow6: 6,5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1 – unique. \n\nRow7: 7,8,4,3,1,6,5,9,2 – unique. \n\nRow8: 5,9,2,7,8,4,3,1,6 – unique. \n\nRow9: 3,1,6,5,9,2,7,8,4 – unique. \n\nNow check columns. Column1: 8,1,9,2,4,6,7,5,3 – all unique. \n\nColumn2: 4,6,2,7,3,5,8,9,1 – unique. \n\nColumn3: 3,5,7,8,1,9,4,2,6 – unique. \n\nColumn4: 1,9,8,4,6,2,3,7,5 – unique. \n\nColumn5: 6,2,4,3,5,7,1,8,9 – unique. \n\nColumn6: 5,7,3,1,9,8,6,4,2 – unique. \n\nColumn7: 9,8,1,6,2,4,5,3,7 – unique. \n\nColumn8: 2,4,6,5,7,3,9,1,8 – unique. \n\nColumn9: 7,3,5,9,8,1,2,6,4 – unique. \n\nCheck blocks. For example, top-left block (rows1-3, columns1-3):\n\nRow1: 8,4,3 \n\nRow2: 1,6,5 \n\nRow3:9,2,7 \n\nAll numbers 1-9, no duplicates. \n\nAnother block: middle-middle block (rows4-6, columns4-6):\n\nRow4:4,3,1 \n\nRow5:6,5,9 \n\nRow6:2,7,8 \n\nAll unique. \n\nLooks like everything is valid. So the final solution is the filled grid.\n ;Answer: [[8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7], [1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3], [9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5], [2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9], [4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8], [6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1], [7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2], [5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4, 3, 1, 6], [3, 1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 7, 8, 4]]"

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where to start. The goal is to fill in the zeros with numbers 1-9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 block has all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.\n\nStarting with the first row: [4, 6, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]. The missing numbers here are 2, 3, 7, 8. Let's check the columns and blocks for each empty cell. The first empty is in column 4 (index 4). The block for the first row is the top-left 3x3 block. Wait, actually, the first row is part of the top-middle block? Wait, Sudoku blocks are divided into 3 rows and 3 columns of 3x3 grids. Let me visualize the blocks:\n\nBlocks are:\nRows 0-2, columns 0-2 (top-left)\nRows 0-2, columns 3-5 (top-middle)\nRows 0-2, columns 6-8 (top-right)\nSimilarly for middle and bottom.\n\nSo the first row (row 0) is in the top-left, top-middle, and top-right blocks depending on the column. The first empty cell in row 0 is column 4, which is in the top-middle block (columns 3-5). Let me check what numbers are already present in column 4. Column 4 has numbers in rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 (so need to find)\nRow 1: 7\nRow 2: 6\nRow 3: 2\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 5\nRow 6: 4\nRow 7: 8\nRow 8: 9\n\nSo existing numbers in column 4 are 7,6,2,5,4,8,9. Missing are 1,3. Wait, but the first row's column 4 is part of row 0. But row 0 already has 4,6,1,9, so in row 0, the existing numbers are 4,6,1,9,5 (from the last column). Wait, original row 0 is [4,6,1,9,0,0,0,0,5]. So existing numbers in row 0 are 4,6,1,9,5. So missing in row 0 are 2,3,7,8. But column 4 (the first empty cell in row 0) can't have numbers already present in column 4. As column 4 has 7,6,2,5,4,8,9. Wait, the existing numbers in column 4 are:\n\nLooking at each row's column 4:\n\nRow 0: 0 (unknown)\nRow 1: 7 (from [9, 0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 0, 6, 0])\nRow 2: 6 (from [0, 7, 0, 4, 6, 0, 9, 0, 2])\nRow 3: 2 (from [6,1,0,3,2,0,0,5,4])\nRow 4: 0 (from [0,5,4,0,0,9,3,2,0])\nRow 5: 5 (from [3,2,8,7,5,0,0,1,0])\nRow 6: 4 (from [2,0,0,5,4,0,1,0,3])\nRow 7: 8 (from [0,9,0,2,8,7,0,4,0])\nRow 8: 9 (from [5,0,6,0,9,3,2,8,7])\n\nSo existing numbers in column 4 are 7,6,2,5,4,8,9. So missing in column 4 are 1,3. But row 0's column 4 can't be 1 or 3? Wait, but row 0 already has 1 and 9. Wait, row 0's existing numbers are 4,6,1,9,5. So if column 4 (row 0) can't be 1 (already in row 0), so possible numbers for column 4 are 3. Because column 4's missing numbers are 1 and 3. But row 0 already has 1, so column 4's cell in row 0 can't be 1. Therefore, it must be 3. So row 0, column 4 is 3. Let me check the block. The cell is in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Let's check if 3 is already in that block. The top-middle block includes:\n\nRow 0 columns 3-5: 9, 0 (now 3?), 0\nRow 1 columns 3-5: 8,7,5\nRow 2 columns 3-5: 4,6,0\n\nSo existing numbers in the block are 9,8,7,5,4,6. So 3 is not present. So yes, 3 is allowed. Therefore, row 0 column 4 is 3. Now the row 0 becomes [4,6,1,9,3,0,0,0,5]. The next missing in row 0 is columns 5,6,7. Let's look at column 5. Column 5's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 5\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7:7\nRow 8:3\n\nSo existing in column 5 are 5,7,3. So possible numbers for row 0 column 5 are 1,2,4,6,8,9. But row 0 already has 4,6,1,9. So possible numbers are 2,8. Let's check the block. The cell is in the top-middle block. Existing numbers in that block are 9,3 (now), 8,7,5,4,6. So missing are 1,2. Wait, but the cell is in column 5 of row 0. The block's existing numbers include 9 (row 0, column 3), 3 (row 0, column 4), and then row 1 columns 3-5 are 8,7,5. Row 2 columns 3-5 are 4,6,0. So existing numbers in the block are 9,3,8,7,5,4,6. Missing are 1, 2. Therefore, row 0 column 5 must be either 1 or 2. But row 0 already has 1 (so can't be 1 again), so it must be 2. Therefore, row 0 column 5 is 2. Now row 0 is [4,6,1,9,3,2,0,0,5]. The remaining columns 6 and 7 in row 0. Let's check column 6. Column 6's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 9\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 3\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 2\n\nExisting in column 6: 9,3,1,2. Missing are 4,5,6,7,8. But row 0 already has 4,6, so possible numbers for column 6 are 5,7,8. Also, the block for row 0 column 6 is top-right (columns 6-8). Let's check that block. The top-right block includes:\n\nRow 0 columns 6-8: 0, 0, 5\nRow 1 columns 6-8: 0, 6, 0\nRow 2 columns 6-8: 9, 0, 2\n\nExisting numbers here are 5,6,9,2. So missing are 1,3,4,7,8. But row 0 already has 4, so possible numbers for row 0 column 6 are 7,8. Let's check column 6 again. Column 6's existing numbers are 9,3,1,2. So possible for row 0 column 6: 4,5,6,7,8. But row 0 already has 4 and 6. So 5,7,8. But the block allows 7,8. So possible 7 or 8. Let's look for other constraints.\n\nLooking at row 0, the remaining numbers to fill are 7 and 8 in columns 6 and 7. Let's check column 7. Column 7 has existing numbers:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 6\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3:5\nRow 4:2\nRow 5:1\nRow 6:0\nRow 7:4\nRow 8:8\n\nExisting in column 7: 6,5,2,1,4,8. Missing are 3,7,9. But row 0 already has 9, so possible numbers are 3 and 7. But row 0's missing numbers are 7 and 8. Wait, row 0's existing numbers are 4,6,1,9,3,2,5. So missing in row 0 are 7,8. Therefore, columns 6 and 7 must be 7 and 8. Let's see:\n\nFor column 7, the possible numbers are 3,7. But row 0's missing is 7 and 8. So if column 7 can only take 7 (since 3 is not in row 0's missing), then column 7 must be 7. Therefore, row 0 column 7 is 7, and column 6 would be 8. Let me check if that works.\n\nIf row 0 column 7 is 7, then column 7 has 7 added. Let's check column 7's existing numbers. 7 is not there yet. Then column 6 would be 8. Check column 6's existing numbers (9,3,1,2). Adding 8 is okay. Also, the block for row 0 column 6 (top-right block) would have 8 added. Let me check if there's a conflict. The top-right block already has 5 (row 0), 6 (row 1 column 7), 9 (row 2 column 6). Adding 8 in row 0 column 6 and 7 in row 0 column 7. That seems okay. So row 0 becomes [4,6,1,9,3,2,8,7,5]. Let me verify:\n\nRow 0 now has 4,6,1,9,3,2,8,7,5. All numbers 1-9, no duplicates. Good. Let's proceed.\n\nNow moving to row 1: [9, 0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 0, 6, 0]. The existing numbers are 9,8,7,5,6. Missing are 1,2,3,4. Let's look for cells that can be filled.\n\nLooking at column 1 (row 1, column 1). Column 1's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0:6\nRow 1:0\nRow 2:7\nRow 3:1\nRow 4:5\nRow 5:2\nRow 6:0\nRow 7:9\nRow 8:0\n\nExisting numbers in column 1: 6,7,1,5,2,9. Missing are 3,4,8. But row 1's missing numbers are 1,2,3,4. So possible numbers for column 1 in row 1 are 3 or 4. Let's check the block. Row 1 is in the top-middle block (columns 3-5) but column 1 is in the top-left block (columns 0-2). The top-left block includes rows 0-2, columns 0-2. Existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow 0: 4,6,1\nRow 1:9, 0, 0\nRow 2:0,7,0\n\nExisting numbers: 4,6,1,9,7. Missing are 2,3,5,8. But row 1's column 1 and 2 are part of this block. So for row 1 column 1, possible numbers 3 or 4. But the block's missing numbers are 2,3,5,8. So 3 is allowed. Let's see if there's a way to narrow down. Maybe looking for other cells in row 1.\n\nLooking at row 1's column 7 is 6 (already filled), column 8 is 0. Let's check column 8. Column 8's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0:5\nRow 1:0\nRow 2:2\nRow 3:4\nRow 4:0\nRow 5:0\nRow 6:3\nRow 7:0\nRow 8:7\n\nExisting in column 8: 5,2,4,3,7. Missing are 1,6,8,9. But row 1's missing numbers are 1,2,3,4. So for column 8 in row 1, possible numbers must be 1. Because the missing in column 8 for row 1 is 1 (since row 1's missing numbers are 1,2,3,4 and column 8's missing includes 1). Wait, but row 1's column 8 can't be 2,3, or 4 because column 8 already has those? Let me check column 8 again. Column 8 has 5,2,4,3,7. So existing numbers are 5,2,4,3,7. So possible numbers for row 1 column 8 are 1,6,8,9. But row 1's missing numbers are 1,2,3,4. So only 1 is possible. Therefore, row 1 column 8 must be 1. Let me check if that's allowed. The block for row 1 column 8 is top-right block. Existing numbers in that block (as before) are 8,7,5 (from row 0), 0,6,0 (row 1), 9,0,2 (row 2). Adding 1 in row 1 column 8 would be okay. So row 1 becomes [9, 0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 0, 6, 1]. Now, row 1's missing numbers are 1,2,3,4 but 1 is filled, so remaining are 2,3,4.\n\nNow looking at column 2 (row 1, column 2). Column 2's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0:1\nRow 1:0\nRow 2:0\nRow 3:0\nRow 4:4\nRow 5:8\nRow 6:0\nRow 7:0\nRow 8:6\n\nExisting in column 2: 1,4,8,6. Missing are 2,3,5,7,9. But row 1's missing are 2,3,4. Wait, row 1's current missing are 2,3,4. So column 2 in row 1 can be 2,3, or 4. But column 2 already has 4 in row 4. So possible numbers are 2,3. Let's check the block (top-left block). The block's existing numbers are 4,6,1,9,7 (from row 2 column 1). So missing are 2,3,5,8. So possible for row 1 column 2 are 2 or 3. Let's see if there are other constraints.\n\nLooking at row 1's column 6 (row 1, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers are 8 (from row 0), 0 (row 1), 9 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 3 (row 4), 0 (row 5), 1 (row 6), 0 (row 7), 2 (row 8). So existing in column 6: 8,9,3,1,2. Missing are 4,5,6,7. But row 1's missing are 2,3,4. Wait, row 1's missing are 2,3,4? Wait, row 1's existing numbers are 9,8,7,5,6,1. Missing are 2,3,4. So for column 6 (row 1 column 6), possible numbers are 2,3,4. But column 6's missing are 4,5,6,7. So overlapping possible numbers are 4. Therefore, row 1 column 6 must be 4. Let me check that. If that's correct, then row 1 column 6 is 4. Let me verify:\n\nRow 1's missing numbers are 2,3,4. Column 6's possible for this cell is 4. So yes. Also, check the block (top-right block for row 1 column 6 is columns 6-8 of rows 0-2). The block has row 0 columns 6-8: 8,7,5; row 1 columns 6-8: 4,6,1; row 2 columns 6-8:9,0,2. Adding 4 in row 1 column 6 is okay since there's no 4 in the block. So yes. Now row 1 becomes [9, 0, 0, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 1]. Now missing in row 1 are 2 and 3 in columns 1 and 2.\n\nLooking at column 1 (row 1 column 1). Column 1's existing numbers are 6 (row 0), 0 (row 1), 7 (row 2), 1 (row 3), 5 (row 4), 2 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 9 (row 7), 0 (row 8). Existing are 6,7,1,5,2,9. Missing are 3,4,8. But row 1's missing are 2 and 3. Wait, row 1's missing are 2 and 3. But column 1 can't have 2 because it already has 2 in row 5. Wait, column 1 has 2 in row 5. Therefore, row 1 column 1 can't be 2. Therefore, it must be 3. So row 1 column 1 is 3, and then column 2 must be 2. Let's check:\n\nRow 1 column 1 is 3. Column 1 now has 3 added. Then row 1 column 2 is 2. Let me check column 2. Column 2's existing numbers: 1 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 4 (row 4), 8 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 0 (row 7), 6 (row 8). Adding 2 is okay. Also, the top-left block now has 3 and 2 added. Existing numbers in the block would be 4,6,1,9,7,3,2. No duplicates. So yes. Now row 1 is [9, 3, 2, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 1]. All numbers filled for row 1. Good.\n\nMoving to row 2: [0, 7, 0, 4, 6, 0, 9, 0, 2]. Existing numbers are 7,4,6,9,2. Missing are 1,3,5,8. Let's look for cells that can be filled.\n\nLooking at column 0 (row 2, column 0). Column 0's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0:4\nRow 1:9\nRow 2:0\nRow 3:6\nRow 4:0\nRow 5:3\nRow 6:2\nRow 7:0\nRow 8:5\n\nExisting: 4,9,6,3,2,5. Missing are 1,7,8. But row 2's missing are 1,3,5,8. So possible numbers for column 0 are 1,8 (since 7 is not in row 2's missing). Let's check the block. Row 2 is in the top-left block (columns 0-2). Existing numbers in the block are 4,6,1 (row 0), 9,3,2 (row 1), and row 2 has 0,7,0. So existing numbers: 4,6,1,9,3,2,7. Missing are 5,8. Wait, row 2's missing are 1,3,5,8. But the block's missing are 5,8. Therefore, row 2 column 0 must be 5 or 8. But column 0's possible are 1,8. Wait, there's a conflict here. The block says it's missing 5 and 8, but column 0's existing numbers don't include 5. Wait, column 0's existing numbers are 4,9,6,3,2,5 (row 5 is 3, row 5's column 0 is 3? Wait, row 5 is [3,2,8,7,5,0,0,1,0]. So row 5 column 0 is 3. So column 0 has 4,9,6,3,2,5? Wait, row 5 column 0 is 3, row 0 column 0 is 4, row 1 is 9, row 3 is 6, row 5 is 3, row 6 is 2, row 8 is 5. So existing in column 0: 4,9,6,3,2,5. Missing are 1,7,8. So row 2 column 0 can be 1, 7, or 8. But the block (top-left) says missing are 5 and 8. Wait, but the block's existing numbers are 4,6,1 (row 0), 9,3,2 (row 1), and row 2's 7. So existing numbers in the block: 4,6,1,9,3,2,7. Missing are 5,8. Therefore, row 2 column 0 must be 5 or 8. But column 0's existing numbers don't have 5? Wait, column 0 has 5 in row 8. So 5 is already present in column 0. Therefore, row 2 column 0 can't be 5. Therefore, it must be 8. So row 2 column 0 is 8. Let me check that. Column 0 now has 8 added, which is allowed. The block also allows 8. So row 2 becomes [8,7,0,4,6,0,9,0,2]. Now row 2's missing are 1,3,5.\n\nNow looking at column 2 (row 2, column 2 is 0). Column 2's existing numbers: 1 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 4 (row 4), 8 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 0 (row 7), 6 (row 8). Existing: 1,2,4,8,6. Missing are 3,5,7,9. Row 2's missing are 1,3,5. So possible numbers for column 2 are 3 or 5. Let's check the block (top-left). The block's existing numbers include 8 (row 2 column 0), 7 (row 2 column 1). Missing are 5. Wait, earlier the block's missing were 5 and 8, but we added 8 in row 2 column 0. Now the block's missing is 5. Therefore, row 2 column 2 must be 5. Let me check. If that's correct, then row 2 column 2 is 5. Let's verify column 2: adding 5 is allowed (not present yet). And the block (top-left) now has 5 added. So row 2 becomes [8,7,5,4,6,0,9,0,2]. Now missing in row 2 are 1 and 3 in columns 5 and 7.\n\nLooking at column 5 (row 2, column 5). Column 5's existing numbers are:\n\nRow 0:2\nRow 1:5\nRow 2:0\nRow 3:0\nRow 4:0\nRow 5:0\nRow 6:0\nRow 7:7\nRow 8:3\n\nExisting: 2,5,7,3. Missing are 1,4,6,8,9. But row 2's missing are 1 and 3. Wait, row 2's missing are 1 and 3. But column 5's existing includes 3 (row 8). So row 2 column 5 can't be 3. Therefore, it must be 1. Let me check. Column 5's existing numbers don't have 1 yet. So adding 1. Then row 2 column 5 is 1. Now row 2 becomes [8,7,5,4,6,1,9,0,2]. The remaining missing in row 2 is 3 in column 7. So row 2 column 7 is 3. Let me check column 7. Column 7's existing numbers: 7 (row 0), 6 (row 1), 0 (row 2), 5 (row 3), 2 (row 4), 1 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 4 (row 7), 8 (row 8). Adding 3 is allowed. Also, the block for row 2 column 7 is top-right. Existing numbers in that block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8): row 0 has 8,7,5; row 1 has 4,6,1; row 2 has 9, 3, 2. Adding 3 is okay. So row 2 is now [8,7,5,4,6,1,9,3,2]. All filled. Good.\n\nNow moving to row 3: [6, 1, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 5, 4]. Existing numbers: 6,1,3,2,5,4. Missing are 7,8,9. Let's look for possible cells.\n\nLooking at column 2 (row 3, column 2). Column 2's existing numbers: 1 (row 0), 2 (row 1), 5 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 8 (row 5), 0 (row 6), 0 (row 7), 6 (row 8). Existing: 1,2,5,8,6. Missing are 3,4,7,9. Row 3's missing are 7,8,9. So possible for column 2: 7,9. Let's check the block. Row 3 is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow 3:6,1,0\nRow 4:0,5,4\nRow 5:3,2,8\n\nExisting numbers: 6,1,5,4,3,2,8. Missing are 7,9. Therefore, row 3 column 2 must be 7 or 9. Let's check column 2's possibilities. If possible, let's see if there are other constraints.\n\nLooking at row 3's column 5 (0). Column 5's existing numbers: 2 (row 0),5 (row 1),1 (row 2), 0 (row 3), 0 (row 4), 0 (row 5), 0 (row 6),7 (row 7),3 (row 8). Existing: 2,5,1,7,3. Missing are 4,6,8,9. But row 3's missing are 7,8,9. So column 5 can't have 7 (already in column 5). So possible for row 3 column 5 is 8 or 9. Let me check if there's a way to find this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at column 6 (row 3, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers: 8 (row 0),4 (row 1),9 (row 2), 0 (row 3),3 (row 4), 0 (row 5),1 (row 6), 0 (row 7),2 (row 8). Existing: 8,4,9,3,1,2. Missing are 5,6,7. But row 3's missing are 7,8,9. So for column 6, possible numbers are 7. Because 7 is in row 3's missing and column 6's missing. Therefore, row 3 column 6 must be 7. Let me check. Adding 7 to column 6 is allowed. Also, the block for row 3 column 6 is middle-middle (columns 3-5) or middle-right (columns 6-8)? Wait, row 3 is in rows 3-5. Columns 6-8 for middle-right block. So row 3 column 6 is in the middle-middle block? Wait, blocks are:\n\nMiddle-left: rows 3-5, columns 0-2\n\nMiddle-middle: rows 3-5, columns 3-5\n\nMiddle-right: rows 3-5, columns 6-8\n\nSo row 3 column 6 is in middle-right block. Existing numbers in that block (rows 3-5, columns 6-8):\n\nRow 3: 0,5,4\nRow 4: 3,2,0\nRow 5: 0,1,0\n\nWait, no. Wait, row 3's columns 6-8 are [0,5,4]? No. Original row 3 is [6,1,0,3,2,0,0,5,4]. So columns 6-8 are 0,5,4. So existing numbers in middle-right block for columns 6-8:\n\nRow 3 columns 6-8: 0,5,4\nRow 4 columns 6-8: 3,2,0\nRow 5 columns 6-8: 0,1,0\n\nExisting numbers in middle-right block: 5,4,3,2,1. Missing are 6,7,8,9. Adding 7 to row 3 column 6 is allowed. So yes. Therefore, row 3 column 6 is 7. Now row 3 becomes [6,1,0,3,2,0,7,5,4]. Now missing in row 3 are 8 and 9 in columns 2 and 5.\n\nLooking back at column 2 for row 3. The block (middle-left) requires 7 or 9. But we already filled row 3 column 2 as part of the missing numbers. Since row 3's missing are 8 and 9? Wait, no. Original row 3's missing after adding 7 is 7,8,9 minus 7, so missing are 8 and 9. Wait, no. Original row 3's existing numbers were 6,1,3,2,5,4. After adding 7 in column 6, the row is [6,1,0,3,2,0,7,5,4]. So missing numbers are 8 and 9 in columns 2 and 5. Let's check column 2. Column 2's existing numbers include 1,2,5,8,6. So missing are 3,4,7,9. But row 3's column 2 can be 9 (since row 3's missing is 8 and 9). Let me check if 9 is allowed in column 2. Column 2 doesn't have 9 yet. Also, the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2) has existing numbers 6,1,0 (row 3), 0,5,4 (row 4), 3,2,8 (row 5). So existing numbers: 6,1,5,4,3,2,8. Missing are 7,9. So row 3 column 2 must be 9. Therefore, row 3 column 2 is 9. Then column 5 (row 3) must be 8. Let me check column 5. Column 5's existing numbers are 2,5,1,7,3. Adding 8 is allowed. So row 3 becomes [6,1,9,3,2,8,7,5,4]. All filled. Good.\n\nNow moving to row 4: [0,5,4,0,0,9,3,2,0]. Existing numbers:5,4,9,3,2. Missing are 1,6,7,8. Let's look for cells.\n\nLooking at column 0 (row 4, column 0). Column 0's existing numbers:4,9,8,6,3,2,5. Missing are 1,7. So possible for row 4 column 0: 1 or 7. Let's check the block. Row 4 is in middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: row 3 has 6,1,9; row 4 has 0,5,4; row 5 has 3,2,8. Existing numbers: 6,1,9,5,4,3,2,8. Missing are 7. Therefore, row 4 column 0 must be 7. Because the block's missing is 7. So row 4 column 0 is 7. Now row 4 becomes [7,5,4,0,0,9,3,2,0]. Missing numbers are 1,6,8 in columns 3,4,8.\n\nLooking at column 3 (row 4, column 3). Column 3's existing numbers:\n\nRow 0:9\nRow 1:8\nRow 2:4\nRow 3:3\nRow 4:0\nRow 5:7\nRow 6:5\nRow 7:2\nRow 8:0\n\nExisting:9,8,4,3,7,5,2. Missing are 1,6. Row 4's missing are 1,6,8. So for column 3, possible numbers are 1 or 6. Let's check the block. Row 4 is in middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers:\n\nRow 3 columns 3-5:3,2,8\nRow 4 columns 3-5:0,0,9\nRow 5 columns 3-5:7,5,0\n\nExisting numbers: 3,2,8,7,5. Missing are 1,4,6,9. But row 4's column 3 can be 1 or 6. Let's see if there are other constraints.\n\nLooking at row 4's column 4 (0). Column 4's existing numbers:3 (row 0),7 (row 1),6 (row 2),2 (row 3),0 (row 4),5 (row 5),4 (row 6),8 (row 7),9 (row 8). Existing:3,7,6,2,5,4,8,9. Missing is 1. Therefore, row 4 column 4 must be 1. Let me check. Column 4's missing is 1. So row 4 column 4 is 1. Now row 4 becomes [7,5,4,0,1,9,3,2,0]. Now missing in row 4 are 6 and 8 in columns 3 and 8.\n\nNow, column 3 (row 4) can be 6 (since column 3's missing are 1 and 6, and 1 is already filled in column 4). Wait, column 3's existing numbers are 9,8,4,3,7,5,2. Missing are 1 and 6. Since row 4's column 3 is 0, and row 4's column 4 is 1, then row 4 column 3 must be 6. Because the only missing is 6. So row 4 column 3 is 6. Now row 4 becomes [7,5,4,6,1,9,3,2,0]. Now missing is 8 in column 8. So row 4 column 8 is 8. Let me check column 8. Column 8's existing numbers:5 (row 0),1 (row 1),2 (row 2),4 (row 3),0 (row 4),0 (row 5),3 (row 6),0 (row 7),7 (row 8). Adding 8 is allowed. So row 4 is now [7,5,4,6,1,9,3,2,8]. All filled. Good.\n\nNow row 5: [3, 2, 8, 7, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0]. Existing numbers:3,2,8,7,5,1. Missing are 4,6,9. Let's look for cells.\n\nLooking at column 5 (row 5, column 5 is 0). Column 5's existing numbers:2 (row 0),5 (row 1),1 (row 2),8 (row 3),9 (row 4),0 (row 5),0 (row 6),7 (row 7),3 (row 8). Existing:2,5,1,8,9,7,3. Missing are 4,6. So row 5 column 5 can be 4 or 6. Let's check the block. Row 5 is in middle-middle block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow 3 columns 3-5:3,2,8\nRow 4 columns 3-5:6,1,9\nRow 5 columns 3-5:7,5,0\n\nExisting:3,2,8,6,1,9,7,5. Missing are 4. Therefore, row 5 column 5 must be 4. Let me check. Yes, because the block is missing 4. So row 5 column 5 is 4. Now row 5 becomes [3,2,8,7,5,4,0,1,0]. Missing are 6 and 9 in columns 6 and 8.\n\nLooking at column 6 (row 5, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers:8 (row 0),4 (row 1),9 (row 2),7 (row 3),3 (row 4),0 (row 5),1 (row 6),0 (row 7),2 (row 8). Existing:8,4,9,7,3,1,2. Missing are 5,6. But row 5's missing are 6 and 9. So column 6 can only take 6. Therefore, row 5 column 6 is 6. Then row 5 column 8 is 9. Let me check. Column 8 for row 5: existing numbers include 5,1,2,4,8,3,7. Adding 9 is allowed. So row 5 becomes [3,2,8,7,5,4,6,1,9]. All filled. Good.\n\nNow row 6: [2, 0, 0, 5, 4, 0, 1, 0, 3]. Existing numbers:2,5,4,1,3. Missing are 6,7,8,9. Let's look for cells.\n\nLooking at column 1 (row 6, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers:6 (row 0),3 (row 1),7 (row 2),1 (row 3),5 (row 4),2 (row 5),0 (row 6),9 (row 7),0 (row 8). Existing:6,3,7,1,5,2,9. Missing are 4,8. But row 6's missing are 6,7,8,9. Wait, column 1's missing are 4 and 8. So row 6 column 1 can only be 8. Because 4 is already in row 6's existing numbers? Wait, row 6's existing numbers are 2,5,4,1,3. So 4 is already present. Therefore, row 6 column 1 must be 8. Let me check. Column 1's existing numbers don't have 8 yet. So adding 8. So row 6 column 1 is 8. Now row 6 becomes [2,8,0,5,4,0,1,0,3]. Missing are 6,7,9 in columns 2,5,7.\n\nLooking at column 2 (row 6, column 2 is 0). Column 2's existing numbers:1 (row 0),2 (row 1),5 (row 2),9 (row 3),4 (row 4),8 (row 5),0 (row 6),0 (row 7),6 (row 8). Existing:1,2,5,9,4,8,6. Missing are 3,7. But row 6's missing are 6,7,9. Wait, row 6's current missing are 6,7,9. But column 2's missing are 3 and 7. Therefore, row 6 column 2 must be 7. Let me check. Adding 7 is allowed. So row 6 column 2 is 7. Now row 6 becomes [2,8,7,5,4,0,1,0,3]. Missing are 6 and 9 in columns 5 and 7.\n\nLooking at column 5 (row 6, column 5 is 0). Column 5's existing numbers:2,5,1,8,9,4,0 (row 6),7,3. Existing:2,5,1,8,9,4,7,3. Missing are 6. Therefore, row 6 column 5 is 6. Now row 6 becomes [2,8,7,5,4,6,1,0,3]. Missing is 9 in column 7. So row 6 column 7 is 9. Let me check column 7. Column 7's existing numbers:7 (row 0),6 (row 1),3 (row 2),5 (row 3),2 (row 4),1 (row 5),9 (row 6),4 (row 7),8 (row 8). Adding 9 is allowed. So row 6 is [2,8,7,5,4,6,1,9,3]. All filled. Good.\n\nNow row 7: [0, 9, 0, 2, 8, 7, 0, 4, 0]. Existing numbers:9,2,8,7,4. Missing are 1,3,5,6. Let's look for cells.\n\nLooking at column 0 (row 7, column 0 is 0). Column 0's existing numbers:4,9,8,6,7,3,2,5. Missing are 1. So row 7 column 0 must be 1. Let me check. Column 0 has no 1 yet. So yes. So row 7 column 0 is 1. Now row 7 becomes [1,9,0,2,8,7,0,4,0]. Missing are 3,5,6 in columns 2,6,8.\n\nLooking at column 2 (row 7, column 2 is 0). Column 2's existing numbers:1,2,5,9,4,8,7,6. Missing are 3. So row 7 column 2 must be 3. Let me check. Column 2 has no 3 yet. So yes. Now row 7 becomes [1,9,3,2,8,7,0,4,0]. Missing are 5 and 6 in columns 6 and 8.\n\nLooking at column 6 (row 7, column 6 is 0). Column 6's existing numbers:8,4,9,7,3,6,1,2. Missing are 5. Therefore, row 7 column 6 is 5. Now row 7 becomes [1,9,3,2,8,7,5,4,0]. Missing is 6 in column 8. So row 7 column 8 is 6. Let me check column 8. Column 8's existing numbers:5,1,2,4,8,9,3,6,7. Adding 6 is allowed. So row 7 is [1,9,3,2,8,7,5,4,6]. All filled.\n\nFinally, row 8: [5, 0, 6, 0, 9, 3, 2, 8, 7]. Existing numbers:5,6,9,3,2,8,7. Missing are 1,4. Let's look for cells.\n\nLooking at column 1 (row 8, column 1 is 0). Column 1's existing numbers:6,3,7,1,5,2,8,9,0 (row 8). Existing:6,3,7,1,5,2,8,9. Missing are 4. So row 8 column 1 must be 4. Let me check. Column 1's existing numbers don't have 4. So yes. Now row 8 becomes [5,4,6,0,9,3,2,8,7]. Missing is 1 in column 3. So row 8 column 3 is 1. Let me check column 3. Column 3's existing numbers:9,8,4,3,6,7,5,2,1. Adding 1 is allowed. So row 8 is [5,4,6,1,9,3,2,8,7]. All filled.\n\nNow let me verify all rows, columns, and blocks for duplicates.\n\nRow 0: [4,6,1,9,3,2,8,7,5] – all unique.\nRow 1: [9,3,2,8,7,5,4,6,1] – all unique.\nRow 2: [8,7,5,4,6,1,9,3,2] – all unique.\nRow 3: [6,1,9,3,2,8,7,5,4] – all unique.\nRow 4: [7,5,4,6,1,9,3,2,8] – all unique.\nRow 5: [3,2,8,7,5,4,6,1,9] – all unique.\nRow 6: [2,8,7,5,4,6,1,9,3] – all unique.\nRow 7: [1,9,3,2,8,7,5,4,6] – all unique.\nRow 8: [5,4,6,1,9,3,2,8,7] – all unique.\n\nCheck columns:\n\nColumn 0: 4,9,8,6,7,3,2,1,5 – all unique.\nColumn 1: 6,3,7,1,5,2,8,9,4 – all unique.\nColumn 2: 1,2,5,9,4,8,7,3,6 – all unique.\nColumn 3:9,8,4,3,6,7,5,2,1 – all unique.\nColumn 4:3,7,6,2,1,5,4,8,9 – all unique.\nColumn 5:2,5,1,8,9,4,6,7,3 – all unique.\nColumn 6:8,4,9,7,3,6,1,5,2 – all unique.\nColumn 7:7,6,3,5,2,1,9,4,8 – all unique.\nColumn 8:5,1,2,4,8,9,3,6,7 – all unique.\n\nCheck blocks:\n\nTop-left (0-2, 0-2):\nRows 0-2 columns 0-2:\n[4,6,1],\n[9,3,2],\n[8,7,5] – all numbers 1-9, no duplicates.\n\nTop-middle (0-2, 3-5):\n[9,3,2],\n[8,7,5],\n[4,6,1] – all unique.\n\nTop-right (0-2, 6-8):\n[8,7,5],\n[4,6,1],\n[9,3,2] – all unique.\n\nMiddle-left (3-5, 0-2):\n[6,1,9],\n[7,5,4],\n[3,2,8] – all unique.\n\nMiddle-middle (3-5, 3-5):\n[3,2,8],\n[6,1,9],\n[7,5,4] – all unique.\n\nMiddle-right (3-5, 6-8):\n[7,5,4],\n[3,2,8],\n[6,1,9] – all unique.\n\nBottom-left (6-8, 0-2):\n[2,8,7],\n[1,9,3],\n[5,4,6] – all unique.\n\nBottom-middle (6-8, 3-5):\n[5,4,6],\n[2,8,7],\n[1,9,3] – all unique.\n\nBottom-right (6-8, 6-8):\n[1,9,3],\n[5,4,6],\n[2,8,7] – all unique.\n\nAll checks pass.

      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out which numbers are missing in each row, column, and 3x3 block. Let me start by writing down the current board so I can visualize it better.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: [4, 9, 7, 0, 0, 1, 8, 2, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 5, 1, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 7]\nRow 2: [0, 2, 6, 4, 9, 0, 3, 5, 1]\nRow 3: [9, 7, 0, 5, 1, 8, 0, 0, 4]\nRow 4: [2, 6, 4, 0, 0, 3, 5, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [5, 0, 8, 0, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\nRow 7: [0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 9, 0, 0, 5]\nRow 8: [6, 4, 0, 0, 3, 5, 1, 8, 0]\n\nAlright, let's start by looking for cells that have only one possible number. Let me check each row, column, and block step by step.\n\nStarting with Row 0: [4,9,7,0,0,1,8,2,0]. The missing numbers are 3,5,6. Let's check each empty cell (positions 3,4,8). \n\nFor position (0,3) (row 0, column 3). The column 3 has numbers 8 (row1), 4 (row2), 5 (row3), 0 (row4?), wait let me check column 3. Column 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 (current cell)\nRow 1: 8\nRow 2: 4\nRow 3: 5\nRow 4: 0 (row4, column3)\nRow 5: 0 (row5, column3)\nRow 6: 1\nRow 7: 6\nRow 8: 0 (row8, column3)\n\nSo existing numbers in column 3 are 8,4,5,1,6. Missing in column 3 are 2,3,7,9? Wait, but the numbers 1-9. Let me list all numbers present in column 3: 8,4,5,1,6. So missing are 2,3,7,9. But the cell (0,3) is in row 0, which already has 4,9,7, etc. The row 0's missing numbers are 3,5,6. So for cell (0,3), possible numbers must be in both row's missing (3,5,6) and column's missing (2,3,7,9). The intersection is 3. So possible value is 3? Let me check the block as well. The block for row 0, column 3 is block (0,1) (since blocks are divided as 0-2 rows and 0-2 columns). So block 0,1 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Wait, let me clarify the blocks. Each Sudoku has 9 blocks: rows 0-2, columns 0-2 (block 0), rows 0-2, columns 3-5 (block 1), rows 0-2, columns 6-8 (block 2). Similarly for rows 3-5 and 6-8. So cell (0,3) is in block 0, columns 3-5. Let's check existing numbers in block 0, columns 3-5 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5):\n\nRow 0: columns 3,4,5: 0,0,1\nRow 1: columns 3,4,5: 8,0,0\nRow 2: columns 3,4,5: 4,9,0\n\nExisting numbers in this block are 8,4,9,1. So missing numbers in the block are 2,3,5,6,7. So for cell (0,3), possible numbers must be in row's missing (3,5,6), column's missing (3, etc.), and block's missing (3,5,6, etc.). So possible numbers are 3,5,6. But earlier, column's missing in column 3 includes 3. So cell (0,3) could be 3, 5, or 6. But wait, in row 0, the missing numbers are 3,5,6. So possible. Hmm, maybe not enough info here. Let's check another cell.\n\nLooking at row 0's last cell (position 8). Let's check column 8. Column 8 has:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 7\nRow 2: 1\nRow 3: 4\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 3\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 5\nRow 8: 0\n\nExisting numbers: 7,1,4,3,5. Missing are 2,6,8,9. But row 0's missing are 3,5,6. So intersection is 6. Therefore, cell (0,8) must be 6? Because row 0 needs 6 there, and column 8 allows it. Let me check the block. Cell (0,8) is in block 0, columns 6-8. Let's check existing numbers in block 0's columns 6-8:\n\nRow 0: 8,2,0\nRow 1: 4,0,7\nRow 2: 3,5,1\n\nExisting numbers: 8,2,4,7,3,5,1. Missing are 6,9. So if cell (0,8) is in this block and needs to be 6, which is missing. So yes. Therefore, cell (0,8) is 6. So row 0 becomes [4,9,7, ?, ?, 1, 8, 2, 6]. Now, row 0's missing numbers are 3,5. Let's check positions 3 and 4 (cells 0,3 and 0,4).\n\nNow, for cell (0,3): column 3 has existing numbers 8,4,5,1,6 (from earlier). So missing in column 3 are 2,3,7,9. But row 0's missing are 3 and 5. So possible for cell (0,3) is 3. Let me check the block. Block 0, columns 3-5. Existing numbers in that block are 8 (row1, col3), 4 (row2, col3), 9 (row2, col4), 1 (row0, col5). Also, in row0's columns 3 and 4. So if cell (0,3) is 3, then check if 3 is in the block. The block doesn't have 3 yet. So yes. So cell (0,3) is 3. Then cell (0,4) would be 5, since row 0's remaining missing number is 5. Let me check column 4 for cell (0,4). Column 4:\n\nRow 0: 0 (current cell)\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 9\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 6\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 3\n\nExisting numbers: 9,1,6,3. Missing are 2,4,5,7,8. Since row 0's cell (0,4) is 5, which is missing in column 4. Let me check block. Block 0, columns 3-5. If cell (0,4) is 5, is there a conflict? The block already has 9 (row2, col4), so 5 is allowed. So yes. Therefore, row 0 becomes [4,9,7,3,5,1,8,2,6].\n\nGreat, that fills row 0. Let me update the board.\n\nNow moving to row 1: [0,5,1,8,0,0,4,0,7]. Missing numbers are 2,3,6,9. Let's check each cell.\n\nLooking for cells with only one possibility. Let's check cell (1,0) (row 1, column 0). Column 0 has:\n\nRow 0: 4\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 9\nRow 4: 2\nRow 5: 5\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 6\n\nExisting numbers: 4,9,2,5,6. Missing are 1,3,7,8. But row 1's missing numbers are 2,3,6,9. Wait, the row 1's current numbers are [0,5,1,8,0,0,4,0,7]. So existing numbers are 5,1,8,4,7. Missing are 2,3,6,9. So cell (1,0) must be one of 2,3,6,9. But column 0's missing are 1,3,7,8. Wait, the intersection here is only 3. Because row 1's possible numbers for cell (1,0) are 2,3,6,9, but column 0 can't have those except for 3? Wait, column 0's existing numbers are 4,9,2,5,6. So missing numbers are 1,3,7,8. Therefore, cell (1,0) must be a number that is in row's missing (2,3,6,9) and column's missing (1,3,7,8). The only common number is 3. Therefore, cell (1,0) is 3. Let me check the block. Block for row 1, column 0 is block (0,0) (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in block 0,0:\n\nRow 0: 4,9,7\nRow 1: 3 (new),5,1\nRow 2: 0,2,6\n\nSo existing numbers: 4,9,7,3,5,1,2,6. Missing is 8. Wait, but cell (1,0) is 3, which is allowed. So yes. So cell (1,0) is 3. Now row 1 becomes [3,5,1,8,0,0,4,0,7]. Now row 1's missing numbers are 2,6,9.\n\nLooking at cell (1,4) and (1,5) and (1,7). Let's check cell (1,7) (row 1, column 7). Column 7 has:\n\nRow 0: 2\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 5\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 7\nRow 6: 4\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 8\n\nExisting numbers: 2,5,7,4,8. Missing are 1,3,6,9. Row 1's missing are 2,6,9. So possible for cell (1,7) is 6 or 9. Let's check the block. Cell (1,7) is in block (0,2) (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow 0: 8,2,6\nRow 1: 4, ?, 7 (cells 6, ?, 8)\nRow 2: 3,5,1\n\nExisting numbers: 8,2,6,4,3,5,1,7. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (1,7) must be 9. Because the block needs 9. So cell (1,7) is 9. Therefore, row 1 becomes [3,5,1,8,0,0,4,9,7]. Now row 1's missing are 2 and 6 in cells (1,4) and (1,5).\n\nLooking at cell (1,4) (row1, column4). Column4's existing numbers: let's check again. Column4:\n\nRow 0: 5 (from earlier)\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 9\nRow 3: 1\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 6\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 3\n\nExisting numbers: 5,9,1,6,3. Missing are 2,4,7,8. Row1's cell (1,4) can be 2 or 6? Wait, row1's missing are 2 and 6. But column4's missing includes 2. However, 6 is not in column4's missing? Because column4 has existing 6 in row5. Therefore, cell (1,4) can't be 6. Therefore, cell (1,4) must be 2, and cell (1,5) must be 6. Let me check:\n\nIf cell (1,4) is 2, then column4 has 2 added. Then cell (1,5) would be 6. Check column5 for cell (1,5). Column5:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow 1: 0 (now 6)\nRow 2: 0 (original was 0, but let me check row2: [0,2,6,4,9,0,3,5,1]. So row2, column5 is 0. So column5 has:\n\nRow 0: 1\nRow 1: 6\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 8\nRow 4: 3\nRow 5: 4\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 9\nRow 8: 5\n\nExisting numbers: 1,6,8,3,4,9,5. Missing are 2 and 7. So if cell (1,5) is 6, which is allowed. But row1's cell (1,5) is 6. Let me check the block. Cell (1,5) is in block (0,1) (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow 0: 3,5,1\nRow 1: 8,2,6\nRow 2: 4,9,0 (original row2, column5 was 0)\n\nSo existing numbers are 3,5,1,8,2,6,4,9. Missing is 7. But cell (1,5) is 6 which is already present in the block? Wait, row1, column5 is 6. The block already has 6 in row1, column5? Let me check. The block includes row1, column5. So if we put 6 there, is that allowed? Wait, the block already has 6? Let me check. The block includes row1, columns 3-5: 8,2,6. So yes, putting 6 there would be a duplicate? Wait no, because that's the cell we're filling. Wait, no, the existing numbers in the block before filling are 3,5,1 (row0), 8,2 (row1's columns 3 and 4), and row2's columns 3-5 are 4,9,0. So the existing numbers are 3,5,1,8,2,4,9. So 6 is missing. Therefore, putting 6 in cell (1,5) is okay. So yes. Therefore, cell (1,4) is 2 and cell (1,5) is 6. So row1 becomes [3,5,1,8,2,6,4,9,7]. Now row1 is complete.\n\nMoving to row2: [0, 2, 6, 4, 9, 0, 3, 5, 1]. Missing numbers are 7,8. Let's check cells (2,0) and (2,5). \n\nCell (2,0) is column0. Column0 has existing numbers: 4,3 (row1), 0 (row2), 9,2,5,0 (row6), 0 (row7), 6. Existing numbers: 4,3,9,2,5,6. Missing are 1,7,8. Row2's missing numbers are 7 and 8. So possible for cell (2,0) is 7 or 8. Let's check the block. Block (0,0) (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block are:\n\nRow0: 4,9,7\nRow1: 3,5,1\nRow2: ?,2,6\n\nExisting numbers: 4,9,7,3,5,1,2,6. Missing is 8. Therefore, cell (2,0) must be 8. So cell (2,0) is 8. Then row2 becomes [8,2,6,4,9,0,3,5,1]. Now row2's missing is 7 in cell (2,5). So cell (2,5) is 7. Let me check column5. Column5 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:6, row2:7, etc. So yes, 7 is allowed. Therefore, row2 becomes [8,2,6,4,9,7,3,5,1].\n\nNow row3: [9,7,0,5,1,8,0,0,4]. Missing numbers are 2,3,6. Let's check each cell. Let's look for cells with unique possibilities.\n\nCell (3,2) (row3, column2). Column2 has:\n\nRow0:7\nRow1:1\nRow2:6\nRow3:0\nRow4:4\nRow5:8\nRow6:5\nRow7:0\nRow8:0\n\nExisting numbers: 7,1,6,4,8,5. Missing are 2,3,9. Row3's missing are 2,3,6. So possible for cell (3,2) is 2 or 3. Let's check the block. Block for row3, column2 is block (1,0) (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3:9,7,?\nRow4:2,6,4\nRow5:5, ?, 8\n\nExisting numbers: 9,7,2,6,4,5,8. Missing are 1,3. Wait, but row3's missing numbers are 2,3,6. But cell (3,2) can't be 2 or 6 because column2 already has 2? Wait, column2's missing are 2,3,9. Wait, column2's existing numbers are 7,1,6,4,8,5. So missing are 2,3,9. But row3's missing are 2,3,6. So intersection is 2,3. Therefore, cell (3,2) can be 2 or 3. Let's check the block. Block (1,0) (rows3-5, columns0-2). Existing numbers include 9 (row3,0),7 (row3,1), 2 (row4,0), 6 (row4,1), 4 (row4,2), 5 (row5,0), 8 (row5,2). Missing numbers in this block are 1,3. Wait, because numbers 1-9. Existing are 9,7,2,6,4,5,8. Missing 1,3. Therefore, cell (3,2) must be either 1 or 3. But row3's missing numbers are 2,3,6. So the only possible is 3. Therefore, cell (3,2) is 3. So row3 becomes [9,7,3,5,1,8,0,0,4]. Now row3's missing numbers are 2 and 6 in cells (3,6) and (3,7).\n\nLooking at cell (3,6) (row3, column6). Column6 has:\n\nRow0:8\nRow1:4\nRow2:3\nRow3:0\nRow4:5\nRow5:9\nRow6:0\nRow7:0\nRow8:1\n\nExisting numbers: 8,4,3,5,9,1. Missing are 2,6,7. Row3's missing are 2 and 6. So possible 2 or 6. Let's check the block. Cell (3,6) is in block (1,2) (rows3-5, columns6-8). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3: ?, ?, 4 (row3, columns6-8: 0, 0, 4)\nRow4: 5, ?, ?\nRow5:9,7,3.\n\nExisting numbers: 4,5,9,7,3. Missing are 1,2,6,8. But row3's missing are 2 and 6. Let's see if there's another constraint. Let's check column6 for cell (3,6). If it's 2 or 6. Let me check if any other cells in the block can restrict this. For example, looking at row4, which has [2,6,4,0,0,3,5,0, 0]. Let's check cell (4,7) and (4,8). Not sure. Maybe looking for other cells. Alternatively, check cell (3,7) (row3, column7). Column7 has existing numbers: 2 (row0), 9 (row1), 5 (row2), 0 (row3), 0 (row4), 7 (row5), 4 (row6), 0 (row7), 8 (row8). Missing are 1,3,6, etc. But row3's missing are 2 and 6. Hmm. Maybe looking for another approach. Let's check the block (1,2) again. The block includes rows3-5, columns6-8. Existing numbers are 4 (row3,8), 5 (row4,6), 9 (row5,6), 7 (row5,7), 3 (row5,8). Missing numbers are 1,2,6,8. Let me see if any of the other cells in the block can be filled. For example, row4, column7. But maybe not yet. Let's look back at cell (3,6). Let me check if there are any other constraints. For example, looking at column6. If cell (3,6) is 2, then column6 would have 2 added. Is that allowed? Yes. If it's 6, then column6 would have 6. Let's see if there's another way. Let's check the row. Row3's missing are 2 and 6. Let's see if cell (3,7) can be filled. For cell (3,7) (column7). Column7's existing numbers are 2,9,5,7,4,8. Missing are 1,3,6. But row3's missing are 2 and 6. So cell (3,7) can only be 6 (since 2 is not in column7's missing). Therefore, cell (3,7) must be 6. Therefore, row3's cell (3,7) is 6. Then cell (3,6) must be 2. Because row3's missing are 2 and 6. So row3 becomes [9,7,3,5,1,8,2,6,4]. Now row3 is complete.\n\nNow row4: [2,6,4,0,0,3,5,0,0]. Missing numbers are 1,7,8,9. Let's check each cell. Let's look for cells with unique possibilities.\n\nLooking at cell (4,3) (row4, column3). Column3 has:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:8\nRow2:4\nRow3:5\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:1\nRow7:6\nRow8:0\n\nExisting numbers: 3,8,4,5,1,6. Missing are 2,7,9. Row4's missing are 1,7,8,9. So intersection is 7,9. Let's check the block. Cell (4,3) is in block (1,1) (rows3-5, columns3-5). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3:5,1,8\nRow4: ?, ?, 3\nRow5: ?, 6, 4\n\nWait, row4's columns3-5 are 0,0,3. Row5's columns3-5: row5 is [5,0,8,0,6,4,9,7,3]. So row5, columns3-5 are 0,6,4. So existing numbers in block (1,1) are 5,1,8 (row3), 3 (row4, column5?), 6,4 (row5). Also, row4's column3 and 4 are 0. Let me list all existing numbers in block (1,1):\n\nRow3: columns3-5: 5,1,8\nRow4: columns3-5: ?, ?, 3\nRow5: columns3-5: ?, 6, 4\n\nSo existing numbers are 5,1,8,3,6,4. Missing are 2,7,9. Therefore, cell (4,3) can be 7 or 9. Let's see if there's another constraint. Let's check row4's missing numbers: 1,7,8,9. So cell (4,3) is in row4, so possible numbers are 7,9. Let's check column3's missing for cell (4,3): 2,7,9. So possible 7 or 9. Let's see if there's another way. Let's check cell (4,4) (row4, column4). Column4 has existing numbers: row0:5, row1:2, row2:9, row3:1, row4: ?, row5:6, row6: ?, row7: ?, row8:3. Existing are 5,2,9,1,6,3. Missing are 4,7,8. Row4's missing are 1,7,8,9. So cell (4,4) can be 7 or 8. Let's check the block (1,1) again. For cell (4,4), possible numbers are 7 or 8. But block (1,1) missing are 2,7,9. So cell (4,4) can be 7. If it's 7, then cell (4,3) can't be 7. Let me see if there's a way to determine this. Alternatively, maybe look at other cells in row4.\n\nLooking at cell (4,7) (row4, column7). Column7 has existing numbers: 2 (row0),9 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3), 0 (row4),7 (row5),4 (row6), 0 (row7),8 (row8). Missing are 1,3, etc. Row4's missing are 1,7,8,9. So cell (4,7) could be 1,7,8, or 9. Let's check the block. Cell (4,7) is in block (1,2) (rows3-5, columns6-8). Existing numbers in this block are row3: 2,6,4; row4:5, ?, ?; row5:9,7,3. Existing numbers: 2,6,4,5,9,7,3. Missing are 1,8. Therefore, cell (4,7) must be 1 or 8. Since row4's missing includes 1 and 8, this is possible. Let's see if we can find more info.\n\nAlternatively, let's check cell (4,8) (row4, column8). Column8 has existing numbers: 6 (row0),7 (row1),1 (row2),4 (row3), 0 (row4),3 (row5),0 (row6),5 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 6,7,1,4,3,5. Missing are 2,8,9. Row4's missing are 1,7,8,9. So cell (4,8) can be 8 or 9. Let's check block (1,2). Missing are 1,8. So cell (4,8) must be 8 (since 1 is also possible but if it's 8, then cell (4,7) would be 1). Let me think. If cell (4,8) is 8, then cell (4,7) would be 1. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nBut how do I know? Let's look for other constraints. Maybe look at row4's column3 and column4. Let me think about the numbers missing in row4: 1,7,8,9. Let's see if any of these can be determined by other cells.\n\nLooking at cell (4,3) and (4,4). The block (1,1) has missing 2,7,9. So cell (4,3) and (4,4) must be 7 and 9 in some order. Let's check if there's another cell in the block that can help. For example, cell (5,3) (row5, column3). Row5 is [5,0,8,0,6,4,9,7,3]. So cell (5,3) is 0. Column3 for cell (5,3) is existing numbers as before. Let's check if cell (5,3) can be filled. Column3's missing are 2,7,9. Row5's missing numbers: let's check row5. Row5 is [5,0,8,0,6,4,9,7,3]. Existing numbers are 5,8,6,4,9,7,3. Missing are 1,2. So cell (5,1) and (5,3). For cell (5,1) (row5, column1): column1 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:9\nRow1:5\nRow2:2\nRow3:7\nRow4:6\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:4\n\nExisting numbers: 9,5,2,7,6,8,4. Missing are 1,3. Row5's missing are 1 and 2. So cell (5,1) must be 1 or 2. Column1's missing are 1,3. So intersection is 1. Therefore, cell (5,1) is 1. Then row5 becomes [5,1,8,0,6,4,9,7,3]. Now row5's missing is 2 in cell (5,3). Therefore, cell (5,3) is 2. So row5 becomes [5,1,8,2,6,4,9,7,3]. Now back to block (1,1). Now, block (1,1) has cell (5,3)=2. So existing numbers in block (1,1) are 5,1,8 (row3), 3 (row4, column5), 2 (row5, column3), 6,4 (row5, columns4-5). So existing numbers are 5,1,8,3,2,6,4. Missing are 7,9. Therefore, cell (4,3) and (4,4) must be 7 and 9. Let's check row4's missing numbers: 1,7,8,9. Since cell (4,3) and (4,4) are 7 and 9, then row4's missing would have 7 and 9 filled here. Now, looking at column3 for cell (4,3): column3 has existing numbers 3,8,4,5,2 (from row5, column3 is 2), 1,6. Missing are 7,9. So cell (4,3) can be 7 or 9. Let's check if there's a way to determine which is which. \n\nLooking at cell (4,4) (column4). Column4's existing numbers are 5 (row0), 2 (row1), 9 (row2), 1 (row3), 6 (row5), 3 (row8). Missing are 4,7,8. But row4's cell (4,4) is part of row4's missing 7 or 9. Wait, but column4's missing are 4,7,8. So if cell (4,4) is 7, that's allowed. If it's 9, that's not in column4's missing. Therefore, cell (4,4) must be 7. Therefore, cell (4,4)=7, and cell (4,3)=9. Let me verify:\n\nCell (4,4) is 7. Column4 now has 7 added. Column4's existing numbers now include 7. That's okay. Then cell (4,3) is 9. Let's check column3 for cell (4,3)=9. Column3 has existing numbers: 3,8,4,5,2,1,6,9? Wait, existing numbers in column3 after adding 9 would be 3,8,4,5,2,1,6,9. Missing is 7. But earlier, we said block (1,1) missing are 7 and 9. Now cell (4,3)=9 fills that, and cell (4,4)=7 fills the other. So yes. Therefore, row4 becomes [2,6,4,9,7,3,5, ?, ?]. Now, row4's missing numbers are 1,8. Let's check cells (4,7) and (4,8). \n\nFor cell (4,7) (row4, column7). Column7 has existing numbers: 2 (row0),9 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3), 0 (row4),7 (row5),4 (row6), 0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing are 2,9,5,6,7,4,8. Missing are 1,3. But row4's missing are 1 and 8. So cell (4,7) must be 1, because column7's missing is 1 and 3. But row4's missing includes 1. So cell (4,7) is 1. Then cell (4,8) must be 8. Let me check column8 for cell (4,8)=8. Column8's existing numbers: 6,7,1,4,3,5. Adding 8 is allowed. Therefore, row4 becomes [2,6,4,9,7,3,5,1,8]. Now row4 is complete.\n\nNow row5 is already filled as [5,1,8,2,6,4,9,7,3]. Let's move to row6: [0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Missing numbers are 2,3,6,7,8,9. Let's look for cells with unique possibilities.\n\nLooking at cell (6,0) (row6, column0). Column0 has existing numbers: 4 (row0),3 (row1),8 (row2),9 (row3),2 (row4),5 (row5), 0 (row6), 0 (row7),6 (row8). Existing are 4,3,8,9,2,5,6. Missing are 1,7. But row6's missing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. So no intersection. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake. Wait, row6 is [0, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Existing numbers in row6 are 5,1,4. Missing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. But column0's existing numbers are 4,3,8,9,2,5,6. Wait, column0's existing numbers include 2, so row6's cell (6,0) can't be 2. So possible numbers for cell (6,0) are 7 (since column0's missing are 1 and 7). But row6's missing includes 7. So cell (6,0) must be 7 or 1? But row6's missing numbers don't include 1. Wait, row6's existing numbers are 5,1,4. Oh wait, row6 already has 1 in column3. So row6's missing numbers are 2,3,6,7,8,9. Column0's missing are 1 and 7. So cell (6,0) can only be 7. Because 1 is already in the row. Therefore, cell (6,0) is 7. So row6 becomes [7, 0, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Now row6's missing are 2,3,6,8,9.\n\nLet me check the block for cell (6,0). Block (2,0) (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow6:7, ?,5\nRow7: ?,8, ?\nRow8:6,4, ?\n\nExisting numbers: 7,5,8,6,4. Missing are 1,2,3,9. But cell (6,0) is 7, which is already accounted for. Let's move on.\n\nLooking at cell (6,1) (row6, column1). Column1 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:9\nRow1:5\nRow2:2\nRow3:7\nRow4:6\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:4\n\nExisting are 9,5,2,7,6,1,8,4. Missing is 3. Therefore, cell (6,1) must be 3. Because column1 is missing 3, and row6's missing includes 3. So cell (6,1) is 3. Now row6 becomes [7,3,5,1,0,0,0,4,0]. Missing are 2,6,8,9.\n\nNow looking at cell (6,4) (row6, column4). Column4 has existing numbers: 5 (row0),2 (row1),9 (row2),1 (row3),7 (row4),6 (row5), 0 (row6), 0 (row7),3 (row8). Existing are 5,2,9,1,7,6,3. Missing are 4,8. But row6's missing are 2,6,8,9. So cell (6,4) can be 8. Let me check the block. Block (2,1) (rows6-8, columns3-5). Existing numbers:\n\nRow6:1, ?, ?\nRow7:6, ?,9\nRow8:0,3,5\n\nExisting numbers: 1,6,9,3,5. Missing are 2,4,7,8. So cell (6,4) is in this block. Possible numbers are 8 (since column4 allows it). Let me check if there's another constraint. Also, row6's missing includes 8. So yes, cell (6,4) is 8. Therefore, row6 becomes [7,3,5,1,8,0,0,4,0]. Now missing in row6 are 2,6,9 in cells (6,5), (6,6), (6,8).\n\nLooking at cell (6,5) (row6, column5). Column5 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:1\nRow1:6\nRow2:7\nRow3:8\nRow4:3\nRow5:4\nRow6:0\nRow7:9\nRow8:5\n\nExisting: 1,6,7,8,3,4,9,5. Missing is 2. Therefore, cell (6,5) must be 2. So row6 becomes [7,3,5,1,8,2,0,4,0]. Now missing are 6 and 9 in cells (6,6) and (6,8).\n\nCell (6,6) (row6, column6). Column6 has existing numbers: 8 (row0),4 (row1),3 (row2),2 (row3),5 (row4),9 (row5), 0 (row6), 0 (row7),1 (row8). Existing: 8,4,3,2,5,9,1. Missing are 6,7. Row6's missing are 6 and 9. So cell (6,6) can be 6 or 9? Wait, column6's missing are 6 and 7. So possible for cell (6,6) is 6. Let me check the block. Block (2,2) (rows6-8, columns6-8). Existing numbers:\n\nRow6: ?,4, ?\nRow7: ?, ?,5\nRow8:1,8, ?\n\nExisting numbers: 4,5,1,8. Missing are 2,3,6,7,9. But cell (6,6) is in this block. Possible numbers are 6 or 9. Let me check if there are other constraints. For example, looking at row6's cell (6,8). Column8's existing numbers: 6 (row0),7 (row1),1 (row2),4 (row3),8 (row4),3 (row5),0 (row6),5 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 6,7,1,4,8,3,5. Missing are 2,9. Row6's cell (6,8) is in row6's missing 6 and 9. But column8's missing are 2 and 9. So cell (6,8) can only be 9. Therefore, cell (6,8) is 9. Then cell (6,6) must be 6. Let me check:\n\nIf cell (6,8)=9, then column8 has 9 added. For cell (6,6)=6, column6 has 6 added. Both allowed. Block (2,2) for cell (6,6)=6: existing numbers would include 6. Let me check if there's a conflict. Block (2,2) has no 6 yet. Yes. So row6 becomes [7,3,5,1,8,2,6,4,9]. Now row6 is complete.\n\nNow row7: [0,8,0,6,0,9,0,0,5]. Missing numbers are 1,2,3,4,7. Let's check each cell.\n\nCell (7,0) (row7, column0). Column0 has existing numbers: 4,3,8,9,2,5,7, 0 (row7),6. Existing are 4,3,8,9,2,5,7,6. Missing is 1. Therefore, cell (7,0) must be 1. So row7 becomes [1,8,0,6,0,9,0,0,5]. Now missing numbers in row7 are 2,3,4,7 in cells (7,2), (7,4), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nLooking at cell (7,2) (row7, column2). Column2 has existing numbers: 7 (row0),1 (row1),6 (row2),3 (row3),4 (row4),8 (row5),5 (row6), 0 (row7), 0 (row8). Existing: 7,1,6,3,4,8,5. Missing are 2,9. Row7's missing are 2,3,4,7. So cell (7,2) can be 2. Let me check the block. Block (2,0) (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow6:7,3,5\nRow7:1,8, ?\nRow8:6,4, ?\n\nExisting numbers:7,3,5,1,8,6,4. Missing are 2,9. So cell (7,2) must be 2 or 9. But row7's missing includes 2. So cell (7,2) is 2. Therefore, row7 becomes [1,8,2,6,0,9,0,0,5]. Now missing numbers in row7 are 3,4,7 in cells (7,4), (7,6), (7,7).\n\nLooking at cell (7,4) (row7, column4). Column4 has existing numbers:5,2,9,1,7,6,8, 0 (row7),3. Existing are 5,2,9,1,7,6,8,3. Missing is 4. Therefore, cell (7,4) must be 4. So row7 becomes [1,8,2,6,4,9,0,0,5]. Now missing are 3 and 7 in cells (7,6) and (7,7).\n\nCell (7,6) (row7, column6). Column6 has existing numbers:8,4,3,2,5,9,6, 0 (row7),1. Existing: 8,4,3,2,5,9,6,1. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (7,6) must be 7. Then cell (7,7) must be 3. Let me check column7 for cell (7,7). Column7 has existing numbers: 2,9,5,6,1,7,4, 0 (row7),8. Existing: 2,9,5,6,1,7,4,8. Missing is 3. So yes, cell (7,7) is 3. Therefore, row7 becomes [1,8,2,6,4,9,7,3,5]. Now row7 is complete.\n\nFinally, row8: [6,4,0,0,3,5,1,8,0]. Missing numbers are 2,7,9. Let's check each cell.\n\nCell (8,2) (row8, column2). Column2 has existing numbers:7,1,6,3,4,8,5,2 (row7). Existing: 7,1,6,3,4,8,5,2. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (8,2) must be 9. So row8 becomes [6,4,9,0,3,5,1,8,0]. Now missing are 2 and 7 in cells (8,3) and (8,8).\n\nLooking at cell (8,3) (row8, column3). Column3 has existing numbers:3,8,4,5,9,2,1,6, 0 (row8). Existing: 3,8,4,5,9,2,1,6. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (8,3) is 7. Then cell (8,8) must be 2. Let me check column8 for cell (8,8). Column8 has existing numbers:6,7,1,4,8,3,9,5. Missing is 2. Yes. So row8 becomes [6,4,9,7,3,5,1,8,2]. Now row8 is complete.\n\nLet me verify all rows to ensure no duplicates and all numbers 1-9.\n\nRow0: [4,9,7,3,5,1,8,2,6] → all unique, 1-9.\nRow1: [3,5,1,8,2,6,4,9,7] → ok.\nRow2: [8,2,6,4,9,7,3,5,1] → ok.\nRow3: [9,7,3,5,1,8,2,6,4] → ok.\nRow4: [2,6,4,9,7,3,5,1,8] → ok.\nRow5: [5,1,8,2,6,4,9,7,3] → ok.\nRow6: [7,3,5,1,8,2,6,4,9] → ok.\nRow7: [1,8,2,6,4,9,7,3,5] → ok.\nRow8: [6,4,9,7,3,5,1,8,2] → ok.\n\nColumns: Let me check a few. Column0: 4,3,8,9,2,5,7,1,6 → all unique. Column1: 9,5,2,7,6,1,3,8,4 → unique. Column2:7,1,6,3,4,8,5,2,9 → unique. Seems good. Blocks also should be okay. For example, block (0,0): rows0-2, columns0-2. Numbers 4,9,7; 3,5,1; 8,2,6 → all unique. All other blocks similarly.\n\nThus, the Sudoku is solved.\n ;Answer: [[4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6], [3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7], [8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1], [9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4], [2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8], [5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3], [7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9], [1, 8, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5], [6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 5, 1, 8, 2]]"

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where to start. Let me write down the current state to visualize it better.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]\nRow 1: [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 7]\nRow 2: [9, 0, 6, 4, 1, 7, 0, 8, 3]\nRow 3: [0, 7, 0, 8, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [8, 3, 9, 0, 6, 4, 1, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [5, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 8, 3, 9]\nRow 6: [0, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 0, 2, 8]\nRow 7: [6, 0, 0, 7, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0]\nRow 8: [7, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n\nHmm. Let's start by looking for cells that have only one possible number based on their row, column, and 3x3 block.\n\nStarting with Row 0. The first cell is 0. Let's check column 0. Column 0 has 0 (row 0), 2 (row1), 9 (row2), 0 (row3), 8 (row4), 5 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 7 (row8). So existing numbers in column 0 are 2,9,8,5,6,7. Missing are 1,3,4. Also, the cell is in the top-left 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). The block has existing numbers in row0: 1, row1: 2,3, row2:9,6. So numbers present are 1,2,3,6,9. Missing in block are 4,5,7,8. Wait, but column 0 for this cell (row0, column0) can't have 2,9, etc. So possible numbers for row0, column0 are numbers not in column 0 (so 1,3,4) and not in the block. The block's missing numbers are 4,5,7,8. So overlapping possible numbers are 4. Because column 0 allows 1,3,4 but block requires that the number is in the missing ones. So 4 is in both. So maybe row0 column0 is 4? Let me check.\n\nWait, let me check again. Column 0's existing numbers are 2,9,8,5,6,7. So missing in column 0 are 1,3,4. The block (top-left) has existing numbers: row0 has 1; row1 has 2,3; row2 has 9,6. So numbers present in block are 1,2,3,6,9. Therefore, missing numbers in the block are 4,5,7,8. So the cell (row0, column0) must be a number that's in both column 0's missing and block's missing. The intersection is 4. So yes, row0 column0 must be 4. Let me fill that in.\n\nSo row0 becomes [4,1,...]. Let me update that.\n\nNow, moving to row0, column2 (third cell). Let's check possible numbers. The row is [4,1,0,...]. Column 2 has existing numbers: row0:0 (now looking for what's present), row1:3, row2:6, row3:0, row4:9, row5:4, row6:5, row7:0, row8:8. Wait, existing numbers in column2 are 3,6,9,4,5,8. Missing in column2 are 1,2,7. Also, the block (top-left) has existing numbers now including 4,1,2,3,9,6. Missing in block are 5,7,8. Wait, but column2's missing are 1,2,7. So the intersection would be 7. So possible number is 7? Let me check.\n\nWait, the cell is in row0, column2. The row0 already has 4 and 1. So numbers not in row0 (so far) are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9. Column2's missing are 1,2,7. But the cell can't be 1 because row0 already has 1. So possible numbers for column2's missing here are 2 and 7. But block's missing numbers are 5,7,8. Wait, block's missing numbers after adding 4 to row0 column0? Let me recheck the block. The top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Now row0 has 4,1, and then row0 column2. Existing numbers in the block are 4,1, 2,3 (row1), 9,6 (row2). So numbers present are 1,2,3,4,6,9. Missing are 5,7,8. So the cell (row0, column2) must be a number from 5,7,8. But column2's missing are 1,2,7. So the only overlapping is 7. Therefore, row0 column2 must be 7. Let me fill that in. So row0 becomes [4,1,7,...].\n\nNow row0 is [4,1,7, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]. Let's check the next empty cell in row0. Let's look at column3 (fourth cell). The row has 4,1,7, then 0. Column3's existing numbers: row0:0, row1:0, row2:4, row3:8, row4:0, row5:1, row6:6, row7:7, row8:3. So existing in column3 are 4,8,1,6,7,3. Missing are 2,5,9. Also, the cell is in the top-middle block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2). Let's check that block. The numbers present in that block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5) are: row0 has 0,0,3; row1 has 0,5,6; row2 has 4,1,7. Existing numbers in the block are 3,5,6,4,1,7. Missing are 2,8,9. So for row0 column3, possible numbers are the intersection of column3's missing (2,5,9) and block's missing (2,8,9). The intersection is 2 and 9. Also, the row already has 4,1,7,3,9,6. Wait, the row is [4,1,7, 0, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]. So existing numbers in row0 are 4,1,7,3,9,6. So missing in row0 are 2,5,8. Therefore, the possible numbers for row0 column3 must be in 2,5,8. But column3's missing are 2,5,9. And block's missing are 2,8,9. So combining all three constraints: possible numbers must be in row's missing (2,5,8), column's missing (2,5,9), and block's missing (2,8,9). The intersection is 2. Because 2 is in all three. Therefore, row0 column3 must be 2. Let me fill that in. Now row0 becomes [4,1,7,2, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6].\n\nNow, the next empty cell in row0 is column4. Let's check. The row is [4,1,7,2, 0, 3, 9, 0, 6]. Column4's existing numbers: row0:0, row1:5, row2:1, row3:3, row4:6, row5:0, row6:4, row7:2, row8:0. Existing in column4 are 5,1,3,6,4,2. Missing are 7,8,9. However, the row already has 4,1,7,2,3,9,6. Wait, row0's existing numbers are 4,1,7,2,3,9,6. So missing in row0 for column4 is 5,8? Wait no. Wait the row has numbers 4,1,7,2, then 0 (column4), then 3,9, 0, 6. The existing numbers in row0 are 4,1,7,2,3,9,6. Missing in row0 are 5,8. But column4's missing are 7,8,9? Wait let me recheck column4. Let me list all the numbers in column4:\n\nRow0: ?\nRow1: 5\nRow2: 1\nRow3: 3\nRow4: 6\nRow5: ?\nRow6: 4\nRow7: 2\nRow8: ?\n\nSo existing numbers are 5,1,3,6,4,2. Missing are 7,8,9. Therefore, the cell (row0 column4) must be one of 7,8,9. But row0's missing numbers are 5,8. Wait, this is conflicting. Wait, row0's existing numbers are 4,1,7,2, then column4 is empty, followed by 3,9, etc. So the existing numbers in row0 are 4,1,7,2,3,9,6. Therefore, missing in row0 are 5,8. But column4 requires the number to be 7,8,9. The intersection is 8. Therefore, row0 column4 must be 8. Let me fill that in. Now row0 becomes [4,1,7,2,8,3,9,0,6].\n\nNow, the next empty cell in row0 is column7. The row is [4,1,7,2,8,3,9,0,6]. Column7's existing numbers: row0:0, row1:0, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:3, row6:2, row7:9, row8:4. Existing in column7 are 8,3,2,9,4. Missing are 1,5,6,7. The row's missing number is 5 (since existing are 4,1,7,2,8,3,9,6). So row0's missing is 5. Therefore, column7's cell must be 5. Let me check if that's allowed. Also, check the block. The cell is in the top-right block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). The existing numbers in that block (row0:9,0,6; row1:4,0,7; row2:0,8,3). Wait, current row0's column7 is 0, which we are filling with 5. The block (columns 6-8) has existing numbers: row0 has 9, 0, 6; row1 has 4, 0,7; row2 has 0,8,3. The numbers present in this block are 9,6,4,7,8,3. Missing are 1,2,5. Since the row0's column7 is 5, which is in the missing numbers of the block. So yes, allowed. Therefore, row0 column7 is 5. Now row0 becomes [4,1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6]. That completes row0. Great!\n\nNow moving to row1: [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 7]. Let's look for easy cells here. Let's check row1 column1 (second cell). Column1's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:7, row4:3, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:2. Existing numbers in column1 are 1,7,3,2. Missing are 4,5,6,8,9. Also, the block (top-left, rows 0-2, columns 0-2) has existing numbers 4,1,7 (row0), 2,3 (row1), 9,0 (row2). Wait, row2 column1 is 0. The existing numbers in the block are 4,1,7,2,3,9. Missing are 5,6,8. So row1 column1 must be in the intersection of column1's missing (4,5,6,8,9) and block's missing (5,6,8). So possible numbers are 5,6,8. Also, row1's existing numbers are 2,3,5,6,4,7. Wait row1 is [2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 7]. Existing numbers are 2,3,5,6,4,7. Missing are 1,8,9. Wait, but column1's cell is in row1, which already has 2,3, etc. So row1's missing numbers are 1,8,9? Wait, row1 has 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 7. So existing numbers are 2,3,5,6,4,7. Missing in row1 are 1,8,9. But column1's missing are 4,5,6,8,9. Wait, the cell can't be 4,5,6 because they are already in row1. So possible numbers for row1 column1 are 8,9. Because they are in column1's missing and also in row1's missing. Also, the block's missing are 5,6,8. So 8 is allowed here. Let me check if there's a way to narrow it down. Let's check column1's possibilities. For row1 column1, possible numbers are 8 and 9. Let's look at the block. The block (top-left) needs one of 5,6,8. But since the row can't have 5 or 6 (already present in row1?), Wait row1 has 5 in column4. So 5 is already present in the row. So the cell can't be 5. Similarly, 6 is already in row1. So the possible numbers are 8. Because 8 is in the block's missing and row's missing. Therefore, row1 column1 must be 8. Let me fill that in. Now row1 becomes [2,8,3,0,5,6,4,0,7]. \n\nNow, row1's next empty cell is column3. Let's check. The row is [2,8,3,0,5,6,4,0,7]. Column3's existing numbers are row0:2, row1:0, row2:4, row3:8, row4:0, row5:1, row6:6, row7:7, row8:3. Existing numbers in column3 are 2,4,8,1,6,7,3. Missing are 5,9. The row already has 2,8,3,5,6,4,7. Missing in row1 are 1,9 (since existing are 2,8,3,5,6,4,7). Wait, row1 is [2,8,3,0,5,6,4,0,7]. So existing numbers are 2,8,3,5,6,4,7. Missing are 1,9. But column3's missing are 5,9. So possible number is 9. Because 9 is in both. Let me check if that's allowed. Also, check the block. The cell is in the top-middle block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2). The existing numbers in this block are row0: 2,8,3; row1: 0 (now 9?), 5,6; row2:4,1,7. So if row1 column3 is 9, then the block has 2,8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7. All numbers 1-9 are present, which is valid. Therefore, row1 column3 is 9. Now row1 becomes [2,8,3,9,5,6,4,0,7]. \n\nNow, the next empty cell in row1 is column7. The row is [2,8,3,9,5,6,4,0,7]. Column7's existing numbers are row0:5, row1:0, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:3, row6:2, row7:9, row8:4. Existing numbers are 5,8,3,2,9,4. Missing are 1,6,7. The row's existing numbers are 2,8,3,9,5,6,4,7. Missing in row1 is 1. Therefore, row1 column7 must be 1. Let me check. Column7 allows 1,6,7. But row1's missing is 1. So yes. Also, the block (top-right block, rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in this block: row0 has 9,5,6; row1 has 4, 0 (now 1?), 7; row2 has 0,8,3. So if row1 column7 is 1, then the block has 9,5,6,4,1,7, and others. No duplicates. So valid. Therefore, row1 becomes [2,8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7]. Now row1 is complete.\n\nMoving to row2: [9, 0, 6, 4, 1, 7, 0, 8, 3]. Let's look at row2. The missing numbers in row2 are the numbers not present. Existing are 9,6,4,1,7,8,3. Missing are 2,5. So row2 has two empty cells: column1 and column6.\n\nLet's check column1 (row2, column1). Column1's existing numbers are row0:1, row1:8, row2:0, row3:7, row4:3, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:2. Existing numbers are 1,8,7,3,2. Missing are 4,5,6,9. But row2's missing are 2,5. Wait, row2's missing are 2 and 5. So for row2 column1, possible numbers are 2 or 5. Let's check column1's missing: 4,5,6,9. So only 5 is in both. Therefore, row2 column1 must be 5. Let me fill that in. Now row2 becomes [9,5,6,4,1,7,0,8,3]. Now, the remaining empty cell is column6. The row's missing number is 2 (since existing are 9,5,6,4,1,7,8,3). So column6 must be 2. Let me check column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:4, row2:0, row3:5, row4:1, row5:8, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 9,4,5,1,8. Missing are 2,3,6,7. The cell is row2 column6. The row's missing is 2. So yes, 2 is allowed. Also, check the block. The cell is in the middle-right block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8?), no. Wait, row2 column6 is in the middle-middle block? Let me think. The blocks are divided as 3x3. Columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8. So row2 column6 is in the middle-right block (columns 6-8, rows 0-2). The existing numbers in this block are row0:9,5,6; row1:4,1,7; row2: (now) 2, 8, 3. Wait, row2 column6 is 2. The existing numbers in the block would then be 9,5,6,4,1,7, 2,8,3. All numbers 1-9 are present, no duplicates. So valid. Therefore, row2 becomes [9,5,6,4,1,7,2,8,3]. Now row2 is complete.\n\nNow moving to row3: [0, 7, 0, 8, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0]. Let's look for possible numbers. Let's check row3. Existing numbers are 7,8,3,9,5. Missing are 1,2,4,6. Let's look for cells with only one possibility.\n\nFirst, row3 column0. Column0's existing numbers: row0:4, row1:2, row2:9, row3:0, row4:8, row5:5, row6:0, row7:6, row8:7. Existing are 4,2,9,8,5,6,7. Missing are 1,3. Also, the cell is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Let's check existing numbers in that block. Row3 has 0,7,0; row4:8,3,9; row5:5,0,4. Existing numbers in the block are 7,8,3,9,5,4. Missing are 1,2,6. So possible numbers for row3 column0 are intersection of column0's missing (1,3) and block's missing (1,2,6). The intersection is 1. Therefore, row3 column0 must be 1. Let me fill that in. Now row3 becomes [1,7,0,8,3,9,5,0,0]. \n\nNow, row3 column2 is 0. Let's check. Column2's existing numbers: row0:7, row1:3, row2:6, row3:0, row4:9, row5:4, row6:5, row7:0, row8:8. Existing are 7,3,6,9,4,5,8. Missing are 1,2. The row3's missing numbers are 2,4,6. Wait, row3 is [1,7,0,8,3,9,5,0,0]. Existing numbers are 1,7,8,3,9,5. Missing are 2,4,6. The cell (row3 column2) must be in column2's missing (1,2) and row's missing (2,4,6). So possible number is 2. Let me check the block. The middle-left block (rows3-5, columns0-2) now has row3:1,7,0; row4:8,3,9; row5:5,0,4. Existing numbers are 1,7,8,3,9,5,4. Missing are 2,6. So the cell (row3 column2) must be 2 or 6. But column2's missing are 1,2. So possible is 2. Therefore, row3 column2 is 2. Let me fill that in. Now row3 becomes [1,7,2,8,3,9,5,0,0]. \n\nNow, row3's missing numbers are 4,6. Let's look at the remaining cells: columns7 and 8. Let's check column7. Column7's existing numbers: row0:5, row1:1, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:3, row6:2, row7:9, row8:4. Existing are 5,1,8,3,2,9,4. Missing are 6,7. The row3's missing numbers are 4,6. So for column7, possible numbers are 6 (since 7 is not in row3's missing). Therefore, row3 column7 must be 6. Let me check. Also, check the block. The cell is in the middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns6-8? No, row3 column7 is in columns 6-8? Wait, columns are divided into 0-2, 3-5, 6-8. row3 column7 is in column7, which is part of columns 6-8. The middle-middle block is columns 3-5? Or columns 6-8? Wait, rows 3-5 and columns 6-8 would be the middle-right block. Let me check the block for row3 column7. The cell is in row3, column7. Which is in the middle-right block (rows 3-5, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block: row3 has 5,0,0; row4 has 1, 0, 0; row5 has 8,3,9. Existing are 5,8,3,9,1. Missing are 2,4,6,7. The cell is row3 column7. The row3's missing numbers are 4,6. Column7's missing is 6,7. So possible is 6. So yes. Therefore, row3 column7 is 6. Now row3 becomes [1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6,0]. \n\nNow, the last empty cell in row3 is column8. The row is [1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6,0]. The missing number is 4 (since existing are 1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6). Therefore, column8 must be 4. Let me check column8. Column8's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:7, row2:3, row3:0, row4:0, row5:9, row6:8, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 6,7,3,9,8. Missing are 1,2,4,5. The row's missing is 4. So yes. Also, the block (middle-right) has existing numbers 5,6 (row3's column7 and 8?), row3 column8 is 4. Let me check the block. The block (rows3-5, columns6-8) has row3:5,6,4; row4:1, ?, ?; row5:8,3,9. So existing numbers are 5,6,4,1,8,3,9. Missing are 2,7. But since the row3's column8 is 4, which is allowed. So yes. Therefore, row3 becomes [1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6,4]. Now row3 is complete.\n\nMoving to row4: [8, 3, 9, 0, 6, 4, 1, 0, 0]. Let's check. Existing numbers are 8,3,9,6,4,1. Missing are 2,5,7. Let's look for cells with only one possibility.\n\nFirst, row4 column3 (fourth cell). Column3's existing numbers are row0:2, row1:9, row2:4, row3:8, row4:0, row5:1, row6:6, row7:7, row8:3. Existing are 2,9,4,8,1,6,7,3. Missing is 5. Therefore, row4 column3 must be 5. Let me fill that in. Now row4 becomes [8,3,9,5,6,4,1,0,0]. \n\nNow, row4's missing numbers are 2,7. The remaining cells are columns7 and 8. Let's check column7. Column7's existing numbers: row0:5, row1:1, row2:8, row3:6, row4:0, row5:3, row6:2, row7:9, row8:4. Existing are 5,1,8,6,3,2,9,4. Missing is 7. Therefore, row4 column7 must be 7. Then row4 column8 would be the remaining number, which is 2. Let me check.\n\nRow4 is now [8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7,0]. Missing is 2. Column8's existing numbers are 6,7,3,4,9,8. So missing are 1,2,5. But row4's missing is 2. So yes, row4 column8 is 2. Let me check the block. The cell (row4 column8) is in the middle-right block (rows3-5, columns6-8). Existing numbers there are row3:5,6,4; row4:1,7,2; row5:8,3,9. All numbers 1-9 present. Valid. Therefore, row4 becomes [8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7,2]. Now row4 is complete.\n\nNow, row5: [5, 0, 4, 1, 0, 0, 8, 3, 9]. Let's check. Existing numbers are 5,4,1,8,3,9. Missing are 2,6,7. Let's look for cells with only one possibility.\n\nFirst, row5 column1 (second cell). Column1's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:8, row2:5, row3:7, row4:3, row5:0, row6:0, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 1,8,5,7,3,2. Missing are 4,6,9. The row's missing numbers are 2,6,7. So possible numbers for row5 column1 are intersection of column1's missing (4,6,9) and row's missing (2,6,7). The intersection is 6. Therefore, row5 column1 must be 6. Let me fill that in. Now row5 becomes [5,6,4,1,0,0,8,3,9]. \n\nNow, row5's missing numbers are 2,7. Let's look at the remaining cells: columns4 and 5. Let's check column4. Column4's existing numbers: row0:8, row1:5, row2:1, row3:3, row4:6, row5:0, row6:4, row7:2, row8:0. Existing are 8,5,1,3,6,4,2. Missing are 7,9. The row's missing are 2,7. So possible numbers for row5 column4 are 7. Because column4's missing are 7,9. So row5 column4 is 7. Let me check. Also, check the block. The cell is in the middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). The existing numbers there: row3:8,3,9; row4:5,6,4; row5:1, ?, ?. Now row5 column4 is 7. Let me check the block. The block (rows3-5, columns3-5) has row3:8,3,9; row4:5,6,4; row5:1, 0 (column5?), 7. The numbers present are 8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7. Missing is 2. Therefore, row5 column5 must be 2. Let me confirm. \n\nRow5 is [5,6,4,1,7,0,8,3,9]. Column5's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:6, row2:7, row3:9, row4:4, row5:0, row6:0, row7:8, row8:0. Existing are 3,6,7,9,4,8. Missing are 1,2,5. The row's missing number for column5 is 2. Therefore, row5 column5 is 2. Let me check the block. Yes, the block needs 2. So row5 becomes [5,6,4,1,7,2,8,3,9]. Now row5 is complete.\n\nNow, moving to row6: [0, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 0, 2, 8]. Let's check. Existing numbers are 5,6,4,2,8. Missing are 1,3,7,9. Let's find cells with only one possibility.\n\nLooking at row6 column0. Column0's existing numbers: row0:4, row1:2, row2:9, row3:1, row4:8, row5:5, row6:0, row7:6, row8:7. Existing are 4,2,9,1,8,5,6,7. Missing is 3. Therefore, row6 column0 must be 3. Let me fill that in. Now row6 becomes [3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 0, 2, 8]. \n\nNow, row6 column1. Column1's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:8, row2:5, row3:7, row4:3, row5:6, row6:0, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 1,8,5,7,3,6,2. Missing are 4,9. The row's missing numbers are 1,3,7,9 (but row6 now has 3 in column0, so missing are 1,7,9? Wait row6 is [3, 0, 5, 6, 4, 0, 0, 2, 8]. Existing numbers are 3,5,6,4,2,8. Missing are 1,7,9. Therefore, row6 column1 can be 1,7,9. But column1's missing are 4,9. So intersection is 9. Therefore, row6 column1 is 9. Let me fill that in. Now row6 becomes [3,9,5,6,4,0,0,2,8]. \n\nNow, row6's missing numbers are 1,7. Let's look at the remaining cells: columns5,6. Let's check column5. Column5's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:6, row2:7, row3:9, row4:4, row5:2, row6:0, row7:8, row8:0. Existing are 3,6,7,9,4,2,8. Missing are 1,5. The row's missing are 1,7. So possible number is 1. Therefore, row6 column5 is 1. Let me check. Also, check the block. The cell is in the bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2). Wait, row6 column5 is in columns 3-5. The block for columns 3-5 and rows 6-8. Let me think. The cell (row6, column5) is in the bottom-middle block (rows6-8, columns3-5). Existing numbers there: row6 has 6,4,0 (now 1); row7 has 7,2,8; row8 has 3, 0, 0. Let me check if 1 is allowed. Yes, since it's not present elsewhere in the block. So row6 column5 is 1. Now row6 becomes [3,9,5,6,4,1,0,2,8]. \n\nNow, the remaining cells in row6 are column6. The row's missing number is 7. So row6 column6 must be 7. Let me check column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:4, row2:2, row3:5, row4:1, row5:8, row6:0, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 9,4,2,5,1,8. Missing are 3,6,7. The row's missing is 7. So yes. Also, check the block. The cell is in the bottom-right block (rows6-8, columns6-8). Existing numbers there: row6 has 0 (now 7), 2, 8; row7 has 0,9,0; row8 has 0,4,0. So adding 7 to row6 column6. Let me check if it's allowed. Yes, since no duplicates. Therefore, row6 becomes [3,9,5,6,4,1,7,2,8]. Now row6 is complete.\n\nNow, row7: [6, 0, 0, 7, 2, 8, 0, 9, 0]. Let's check. Existing numbers are 6,7,2,8,9. Missing are 1,3,4,5. Let's look for cells with only one possibility.\n\nFirst, row7 column1. Column1's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:8, row2:5, row3:7, row4:3, row5:6, row6:9, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 1,8,5,7,3,6,9,2. Missing is 4. Therefore, row7 column1 must be 4. Let me fill that in. Now row7 becomes [6,4,0,7,2,8,0,9,0]. \n\nNow, row7's missing numbers are 1,3,5. Let's look at row7 column2. Column2's existing numbers: row0:7, row1:3, row2:6, row3:2, row4:9, row5:4, row6:5, row7:0, row8:8. Existing are 7,3,6,2,9,4,5,8. Missing is 1. Therefore, row7 column2 must be 1. Let me fill that in. Now row7 becomes [6,4,1,7,2,8,0,9,0]. \n\nNow, row7's missing numbers are 3,5. The remaining cells are columns6 and 8. Let's check column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:4, row2:2, row3:5, row4:1, row5:8, row6:7, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 9,4,2,5,1,8,7. Missing are 3,6. The row's missing are 3,5. So possible number for column6 is 3. Therefore, row7 column6 is 3. Then row7 column8 must be 5. Let me check. \n\nRow7 becomes [6,4,1,7,2,8,3,9,5]. Let me verify. Column8's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:7, row2:3, row3:4, row4:2, row5:9, row6:8, row7:5, row8:0. Existing are 6,7,3,4,2,9,8,5. Missing is 1. But row7's column8 is 5, which is allowed. Also, check the block. The cell (row7 column6) is in the bottom-right block (rows6-8, columns6-8). Existing numbers there: row6:7,2,8; row7:3,9,5; row8: ?,4, ?. Let me check if there are duplicates. No, all numbers are unique. So valid. Therefore, row7 is complete.\n\nFinally, row8: [7, 2, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0]. Let's check. Existing numbers are 7,2,8,3,4. Missing are 1,5,6,9. Let's look for cells with only one possibility.\n\nFirst, row8 column4. Column4's existing numbers: row0:8, row1:5, row2:1, row3:3, row4:6, row5:7, row6:4, row7:2, row8:0. Existing are 8,5,1,3,6,7,4,2. Missing is 9. Therefore, row8 column4 must be 9. Let me fill that in. Now row8 becomes [7,2,8,3,9,0,0,4,0]. \n\nNow, row8's missing numbers are 1,5,6. Let's look at row8 column5. Column5's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:6, row2:7, row3:9, row4:4, row5:2, row6:1, row7:8, row8:0. Existing are 3,6,7,9,4,2,1,8. Missing is 5. Therefore, row8 column5 must be 5. Let me fill that in. Now row8 becomes [7,2,8,3,9,5,0,4,0]. \n\nNow, row8's missing numbers are 1,6. The remaining cells are columns6 and 8. Let's check column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:4, row2:2, row3:5, row4:1, row5:8, row6:7, row7:3, row8:0. Existing are 9,4,2,5,1,8,7,3. Missing is 6. Therefore, row8 column6 must be 6. Then row8 column8 must be 1. Let me check. \n\nRow8 becomes [7,2,8,3,9,5,6,4,1]. Let me verify. Column8's existing numbers now include 1. All columns and blocks should be valid. \n\nLet me check the bottom-right block (rows6-8, columns6-8). Existing numbers: row6:7,2,8; row7:3,9,5; row8:6,4,1. All numbers 1-9 present. Valid. \n\nSo all rows are filled. Let me check each row for duplicates and completeness.\n\nRow0: [4,1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6] – all unique, 1-9.\nRow1: [2,8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7] – all unique.\nRow2: [9,5,6,4,1,7,2,8,3] – all unique.\nRow3: [1,7,2,8,3,9,5,6,4] – all unique.\nRow4: [8,3,9,5,6,4,1,7,2] – all unique.\nRow5: [5,6,4,1,7,2,8,3,9] – all unique.\nRow6: [3,9,5,6,4,1,7,2,8] – all unique.\nRow7: [6,4,1,7,2,8,3,9,5] – all unique.\nRow8: [7,2,8,3,9,5,6,4,1] – all unique.\n\nColumns and blocks also seem okay. I think this is the correct solution.\n ;Answer: [[4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6], [2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7], [9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3], [1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4], [8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2], [5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9], [3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8], [6, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5], [7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 4, 1]]"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out which numbers are missing in each row, column, and 3x3 block. Let me start by writing down the current board to visualize it better.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: [6, 1, 0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 0]\nRow 1: [0, 0, 2, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1, 3]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]\nRow 3: [0, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 3, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 5]\nRow 5: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6]\nRow 6: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 4]\nRow 7: [0, 7, 4, 0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1]\nRow 8: [8, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 5, 9]\n\nHmm, let's start by checking each row for missing numbers. Let's take Row 0 first. The existing numbers are 6,1,4,2,5. Missing are 3,7,8,9. Let's look at the columns and block for possible placements.\n\nLooking at Row 0, position (0,2) is empty. Let's see which numbers can go there. Column 2 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:2, row2:8, row3:5, row4:6, row5:0, row6:0, row7:4, row8:1. So column 2 has 2,8,5,6,4,1. Missing in column 2 are 3,7,9. Also, the block for Row 0, column 2 is the top-middle 3x3 block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5?), wait no, blocks are divided as follows:\n\nBlocks are:\nTop-left: rows 0-2, columns 0-2\nTop-middle: rows 0-2, columns 3-5\nTop-right: rows 0-2, columns 6-8\nMiddle-left: rows 3-5, columns 0-2\nMiddle-middle: rows 3-5, columns 3-5\nMiddle-right: rows 3-5, columns 6-8\nBottom-left: rows 6-8, columns 0-2\nBottom-middle: rows 6-8, columns 3-5\nBottom-right: rows 6-8, columns 6-8\n\nSo for cell (0,2), which is in block top-left (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Let's check existing numbers in that block. Row 0 has 6,1. Row 1 starts with 0,0,2. Row 2 has 5. So existing numbers in block top-left are 6,1,2,5. Missing are 3,4,7,8,9? Wait, numbers in the block are 6,1,2,5. So missing are 3,4,7,8,9? Wait, the block must contain 1-9. Let me list all existing numbers in block top-left:\n\nRow 0: 6,1,0,0,4,2... but the block is columns 0-2. So row0 columns 0-2: 6,1,0. Row1 columns 0-2: 0,0,2. Row2 columns 0-2: 5,0,8. So existing numbers in the block are 6,1,2,5,8. So missing numbers in the block are 3,4,7,9. Wait, but 4 is present in row0 column4 (outside the block). So for cell (0,2), possible numbers are 3,4,7,9? But column 2 already has 2,8,5,6,4, etc. Wait column 2: existing numbers are 0 (row0), 2 (row1), 8 (row2), 5 (row3), 6 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 4 (row7), 1 (row8). So column 2 has 2,8,5,6,4,1. So missing in column 2 are 3,7,9. So for cell (0,2), possible numbers are the intersection of missing in row, column, and block.\n\nRow 0 missing: 3,7,8,9. Column 2 missing: 3,7,9. Block top-left missing: 3,4,7,9. So the intersection is 3,7,9. So possible candidates for (0,2) are 3,7,9. Hmm. Let me check if any of these can be determined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another cell that's easier. Let's check Row 0, column 7 (which is 0). Let's see. Column 7 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:1, row2:0, row3:3, row4:0, row5:0, row6:7, row7:6, row8:5. So column 7 has 1,3,7,6,5. Missing are 2,4,8,9. For row 0, column 7: row 0 needs 3,7,8,9. So possible numbers for (0,7) are 8,9. Because column 7's missing in that cell is 2,4,8,9. Intersection with row's missing (3,7,8,9) gives 8,9. Also, check the block. Cell (0,7) is in top-right block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Let's check existing numbers in that block. Row0 columns 6-8: 5,0,0. Row1: 6,1,3. Row2: 0,0,2. Existing numbers: 5,6,1,3,2. Missing are 4,7,8,9. So possible numbers for (0,7) are 8,9 (from row and column) and also in block missing 8,9. So yes, possible 8 or 9. Not sure yet. Maybe another cell.\n\nLet me check Row 5: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6]. Missing numbers here are 2,3,5,7,8. Let's look for cells with only one possibility. For example, column 1 (row5, column1 is 0). Column 1 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:0, row6:0, row7:7, row8:0. Let's see: existing in column1 are 1,2,8,7. Missing are 3,4,5,6,9. But row5's missing numbers are 2,3,5,7,8. So intersection is 3,5. Also, check block. Row5 is in middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Let's look at existing numbers in that block. Row3 columns 0-2: 0,2,5. Row4: 0,8,6. Row5:1,0,0. Existing numbers: 2,5,8,6,1. Missing are 3,4,7,9. So for cell (5,1), possible numbers are 3,5 (from column and row) but block missing includes 3,4,7,9. So only 3 is possible here. Because 5 is not in the block's missing (since 5 is already in row3 column1). Wait, the block's missing numbers are 3,4,7,9. So the possible numbers for cell (5,1) must be in the intersection of row's missing (3,5), column's missing (3,5?), and block's missing (3,4,7,9). So the only common number is 3. Therefore, cell (5,1) must be 3. Let me check that again.\n\nRow5, column1: the row has missing 2,3,5,7,8. Column1 has existing numbers 1,2,8,7. So missing in column1 are 3,4,5,6,9. The intersection between row's missing and column's missing is 3,5. The block (middle-left) has existing numbers 2,5,8,6,1. So missing in the block are 3,4,7,9. Therefore, the only number that is in both the row/column intersection and the block's missing is 3. So yes, cell (5,1) is 3. Let me update that.\n\nNow, row5 becomes [1, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 9, 0, 6]. Let's check if that helps other cells.\n\nNow, looking at row5, column2 is 0. Let's see. Column2 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:2, row2:8, row3:5, row4:6, row5:0 (now), row6:0, row7:4, row8:1. So column2 has 2,8,5,6,4,1. Missing are 3,7,9. Row5's missing numbers now are 2,5,7,8 (since we added 3). Wait, row5 is [1,3,0,4,0,0,9,0,6]. Existing numbers are 1,3,4,9,6. Missing are 2,5,7,8. For cell (5,2), column2 missing are 3,7,9. So intersection is 7. Because row's missing is 2,5,7,8 and column's missing is 3,7,9. So only 7 is common. Therefore, cell (5,2) must be 7. Let me check the block as well. Middle-left block's existing numbers now include 3 (from cell (5,1)), so existing numbers are 1,3,2,5,8,6. So missing are 4,7,9. Wait, cell (5,2) is in middle-left block. So possible numbers for this cell must be in block's missing (4,7,9). But we have intersection of row/column as 7. Since 7 is in block's missing, it's valid. So cell (5,2) is 7. Updating row5: [1,3,7,4,0,0,9,0,6].\n\nNow, row5's missing numbers are 2,5,8. Let's look at cell (5,4) (row5, column4). Column4 has existing numbers: row0:4, row1:9, row2:1, row3:8, row4:3, row5:0, row6:0, row7:5, row8:0. So column4 has 4,9,1,8,3,5. Missing are 2,6,7. But row5's missing in this cell (row5) are 2,5,8. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (5,4) must be 2. Let me check the block. Middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). Existing numbers in that block: row3 columns3-5:9,8,6; row4:1,3,7; row5:4,2, ... (cell (5,4) is 2). Let me see existing numbers: 9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2. Missing is 5. Wait, but cell (5,4) is in column4 which is part of the middle-middle block. Wait, cell (5,4) is column4, which is in columns 3-5. So the block is middle-middle. Existing numbers in that block include 9,8,6 (row3), 1,3,7 (row4), and 4 (row5, column3) and now cell (5,4) would be 2. So existing numbers would be 9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2. Missing is 5. But row5's missing for this cell is 2, which is possible? Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nRow5's cell (5,4) is column4. The row5's missing numbers after adding 3 and 7 are 2,5,8. Column4's existing numbers are 4 (row0), 9 (row1), 1 (row2), 8 (row3), 3 (row4), 0 (row5), 0 (row6), 5 (row7), 0 (row8). So column4 has 4,9,1,8,3,5. So missing in column4 are 2,6,7. The row's missing for cell (5,4) is 2,5,8. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (5,4) must be 2. But what about the block? The middle-middle block (rows3-5, columns3-5). Let's see what numbers are present there. For row3 columns3-5: 9,8,6. Row4 columns3-5: 1,3,7. Row5 columns3-5: 4 (column3), 2 (column4), and column5 is 0. So existing numbers are 9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2. The missing number is 5. But cell (5,4) is in this block. However, according to the row and column, it's 2. But 2 is already present in this block? Let me check. The block includes row5 column3 (4), column4 (2), and column5 (0). Are there any 2s in this block? Let's check other rows. Row3 columns3-5: 9,8,6 (no 2). Row4: 1,3,7. So no 2. So adding 2 here is allowed. Therefore, cell (5,4) is 2. Updating row5: [1,3,7,4,2,0,9,0,6]. Now, missing in row5 is 5 and 8. Let's look at cell (5,5). Column5 has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:0, row2:0, row3:6, row4:7, row5:0, row6:0, row7:9, row8:0. Existing in column5: 2,6,7,9. Missing are 1,3,4,5,8. But row5's missing for this cell is 5 and 8. So possible 5 or 8. Check the block. Middle-middle block's existing numbers now include 9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2. Missing is 5. Therefore, cell (5,5) must be 5. So that's the only possibility. Updating row5: [1,3,7,4,2,5,9,0,6]. Now, row5's missing is 8 in cell (5,7). Column7 for cell (5,7) has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:1, row2:0, row3:3, row4:0, row5:0, row6:7, row7:6, row8:5. Existing are 1,3,7,6,5. Missing are 2,4,8,9. Row5's missing is 8. So cell (5,7) must be 8. So updating row5: [1,3,7,4,2,5,9,8,6]. Now row5 is complete.\n\nThat's a good progress. Let's see if this helps other parts.\n\nNow, looking at Row 4: [0, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 5]. Missing numbers are 2,9 in the row. Let's check cell (4,0) and (4,7). \n\nFor cell (4,0): column0 has existing numbers: row0:6, row1:0, row2:5, row3:0, row4:0, row5:1, row6:2, row7:0, row8:8. Existing in column0: 6,5,1,2,8. Missing are 3,4,7,9. Row4's missing are 2,9. So intersection is 9. Therefore, cell (4,0) must be 9. Let me check the block. Middle-left block (rows3-5, columns0-2). Existing numbers in that block: row3 columns0-2: 0,2,5; row4: 9,8,6; row5:1,3,7. Existing numbers: 2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7. Missing is 4. Wait, but cell (4,0) is 9, which is allowed because it's not in the block's existing numbers? Wait, the block's existing numbers are 2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7. So 9 is already present? Wait, row4's cell (4,0) is in the middle-left block. If we put 9 there, but the block already has 9 in row4, column0? Wait, no, the block includes row3-5, columns0-2. So row4, column0 is part of this block. Before adding 9, the block didn't have 9. So adding 9 is okay. Therefore, cell (4,0) is 9. Updating row4: [9,8,6,1,3,7,4,0,5]. Now, missing in row4 is 2 in cell (4,7). Column7 for cell (4,7) has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:1, row2:0, row3:3, row4:0, row5:8, row6:7, row7:6, row8:5. Existing are 1,3,8,7,6,5. Missing are 2,4,9. Row4's missing is 2. Therefore, cell (4,7) is 2. Updating row4: [9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2,5]. Now row4 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at Row 3: [0, 2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 0, 3, 0]. Missing numbers are 1,4,7. Let's check cell (3,0), (3,6), (3,8). \n\nFor cell (3,0): column0 has existing numbers: 6 (row0), 0 (row1),5 (row2), 0 (row3),9 (row4),1 (row5),2 (row6), 0 (row7),8 (row8). Existing in column0: 6,5,9,1,2,8. Missing are 3,4,7. Row3's missing are 1,4,7. Intersection is 4,7. Check block. Middle-left block (rows3-5, columns0-2). Existing numbers: row3 columns0-2: 0,2,5; row4:9,8,6; row5:1,3,7. Existing numbers: 2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7. Missing is 4. Therefore, cell (3,0) must be 4. Because the block is missing 4. So even though row and column suggest 4 or 7, the block requires 4. Therefore, cell (3,0) is 4. Updating row3: [4,2,5,9,8,6,0,3,0]. Now, missing in row3 are 1 and 7 in cells (3,6) and (3,8).\n\nFor cell (3,6): column6 has existing numbers: row0:5, row1:6, row2:0, row3:0, row4:4, row5:9, row6:3, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 5,6,4,9,3,2. Missing are 1,7,8. Row3's missing for this cell is 1 or 7. So possible 1 or 7. Check the block. Middle-right block (rows3-5, columns6-8). Existing numbers: row3 columns6-8: 0,3,0; row4:4,2,5; row5:9,8,6. Existing numbers include 3,4,2,5,9,8,6. Missing are 1,7. So cell (3,6) can be 1 or 7. Let's check column6. For column6, missing are 1,7,8. So possible numbers for cell (3,6) are 1,7. Also, check the row's missing. So possibilities are 1 or 7. Let's see if there's another clue. Let's look at cell (3,8). Column8 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:3, row2:2, row3:0, row4:5, row5:6, row6:4, row7:1, row8:9. Existing are 3,2,5,6,4,1,9. Missing are 7,8. Row3's missing for cell (3,8) is 1 or 7. So intersection is 7. Therefore, cell (3,8) must be 7. Because column8 is missing 7 and 8, and row3's missing here is 7. Let me check. If cell (3,8) is 7, then cell (3,6) would be 1. Let me check if that works.\n\nIf cell (3,8) is 7, then row3 becomes [4,2,5,9,8,6,0,3,7]. Now, missing in row3 is 1 in cell (3,6). Column6 for cell (3,6) is missing 1,7,8. If we put 1 there, that's allowed. Also, block middle-right (rows3-5, columns6-8) now has 1 in cell (3,6), 3,7 in row3; 4,2,5 in row4; 9,8,6 in row5. All numbers 1-9 would be present. So yes, that works. Therefore, cell (3,6) is 1, cell (3,8) is 7. Updating row3: [4,2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7]. Now row3 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at Row 6: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 4]. Missing numbers are 1,5,6,8,9. Let's check for possible cells. Let's look at column1 for row6 (cell (6,1)). Column1 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:3, row6:0, row7:7, row8:0. Existing are 1,2,8,3,7. Missing are 4,5,6,9. Row6's missing numbers are 1,5,6,8,9. So intersection is 5,6,9. Also, check block. Bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers: row6:2,0,0; row7:0,7,4; row8:8,0,1. Existing numbers: 2,7,4,8,1. Missing are 3,5,6,9. So possible numbers for cell (6,1) are 5,6,9. Let me see if there's a way to narrow down. Let's check other cells in row6.\n\nLooking at cell (6,3) which is 0. Column3 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:5, row2:6, row3:9, row4:1, row5:4, row6:0, row7:0, row8:3. Existing are 5,6,9,1,4,3. Missing are 2,7,8. But row6's missing are 1,5,6,8,9. So intersection is 8. Therefore, cell (6,3) must be 8. Wait, but column3's missing are 2,7,8. So if cell (6,3) is in column3, then possible numbers are 2,7,8. But row6's missing includes 8. So possible 8. Let me check the block. Cell (6,3) is in bottom-middle block (rows6-8, columns3-5). Let's check existing numbers there. Row6 columns3-5: 0,0,0. Row7 columns3-5: 0,5,9. Row8 columns3-5:3,0,0. Existing numbers are 5,9,3. So missing are 1,2,4,6,7,8. Therefore, cell (6,3) can be 8 (from column and row). So yes, cell (6,3) is 8. Updating row6: [2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3, 7, 4]. Now, column3 has 8 added, so missing are 2,7.\n\nNow, looking at row6, missing numbers are 1,5,6,9. Let's check cell (6,4) (column4). Column4 has existing numbers: row0:4, row1:9, row2:1, row3:8, row4:3, row5:2, row6:0, row7:5, row8:0. Existing are 4,9,1,8,3,2,5. Missing are 6,7. Row6's missing here is 1,5,6,9. So intersection is 6. Therefore, cell (6,4) must be 6. Let me check block. Bottom-middle block (rows6-8, columns3-5). Existing numbers now include 8 (row6,3), and cell (6,4) is 6. Let me check if 6 is allowed. The block's existing numbers are 8,6, and others. Let me see. Yes, since there's no other 6 in the block. Updating row6: [2, 0, 0, 8, 6, 0, 3, 7, 4]. Now, missing in row6 are 1,5,9. \n\nLooking at cell (6,5) (column5). Column5 has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:0, row2:0, row3:6, row4:7, row5:5, row6:0, row7:9, row8:0. Existing are 2,6,7,5,9. Missing are 1,3,4,8. Row6's missing here is 1,5,9. Intersection is 1. Therefore, cell (6,5) must be 1. Let me check the block. Bottom-middle block (columns3-5). Adding 1 here. Existing numbers in block: row6:8,6,1; row7:0,5,9; row8:3,0,0. No duplicates. So yes. Updating row6: [2, 0, 0, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4]. Now, missing in row6 are 5 and 9. \n\nLooking at cells (6,1) and (6,2). Let's check column1 for cell (6,1). Column1's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:3, row6:0, row7:7, row8:0. Missing are 4,5,6,9. Row6's missing are 5,9. So possible 5 or 9. Check block bottom-left (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers: row6:2,0,0; row7:0,7,4; row8:8,0,1. Existing numbers are 2,7,4,8,1. Missing are 3,5,6,9. So possible numbers for cell (6,1) are 5,9. Let's see if there's another clue. Let's look at cell (6,2). Column2 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:2, row2:8, row3:5, row4:6, row5:7, row6:0, row7:4, row8:1. Existing are 2,8,5,6,7,4,1. Missing are 3,9. Row6's missing are 5,9. So for cell (6,2), possible numbers are intersection of row's missing (5,9) and column's missing (3,9). Only 9. Therefore, cell (6,2) must be 9. Updating row6: [2, 0, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4]. Now, row6's missing is 5 in cell (6,1). Therefore, cell (6,1) is 5. Updating row6: [2, 5, 9, 8, 6, 1, 3, 7, 4]. Now row6 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at Row 7: [0, 7, 4, 0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1]. Missing numbers are 2,3,8. Let's check cells.\n\nFor cell (7,0): column0 has existing numbers: 6, row1:0, row2:5, row3:4, row4:9, row5:1, row6:2, row7:0, row8:8. Existing are 6,5,4,9,1,2,8. Missing are 3,7. Row7's missing are 2,3,8. Intersection is 3. Therefore, cell (7,0) must be 3. Let me check the block. Bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers: row6:2,5,9; row7:3,7,4; row8:8,0,1. Existing are 2,5,9,3,7,4,8,1. Missing is 6. Wait, but cell (7,0) is 3, which is allowed. Updating row7: [3, 7, 4, 0, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1]. Now missing in row7 are 2,8 in cells (7,3) and (7,6).\n\nLooking at cell (7,3): column3 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:5, row2:6, row3:9, row4:1, row5:4, row6:8, row7:0, row8:3. Existing are 5,6,9,1,4,8,3. Missing are 2,7. Row7's missing here is 2 or 8. So intersection is 2. Therefore, cell (7,3) must be 2. Check block. Bottom-middle block (rows6-8, columns3-5). Existing numbers: row6:8,6,1; row7:2,5,9; row8:3,0,0. So adding 2 here is okay. Updating row7: [3,7,4,2,5,9,0,6,1]. Now missing in row7 is 8 in cell (7,6). Column6 has existing numbers: row0:5, row1:6, row2:0, row3:1, row4:4, row5:9, row6:3, row7:0, row8:2. Existing are 5,6,1,4,9,3,2. Missing are 7,8. Row7's missing is 8. So cell (7,6) is 8. Updating row7: [3,7,4,2,5,9,8,6,1]. Now row7 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at Row 8: [8, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 5, 9]. Missing numbers are 4,6,7. Let's check cells.\n\nCell (8,1): column1 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:3, row6:5, row7:7, row8:0. Existing are 1,2,8,3,5,7. Missing are 4,6,9. Row8's missing are 4,6,7. Intersection is 4,6. Check block. Bottom-left block (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers: row6:2,5,9; row7:3,7,4; row8:8,0,1. Existing are 2,5,9,3,7,4,8,1. Missing is 6. So cell (8,1) must be 6. Because the block is missing 6. Updating row8: [8,6,1,3,0,0,2,5,9]. Now missing in row8 are 4 and 7 in cells (8,4) and (8,5).\n\nLooking at cell (8,4): column4 has existing numbers: row0:4, row1:9, row2:1, row3:8, row4:3, row5:2, row6:6, row7:5, row8:0. Existing are 4,9,1,8,3,2,6,5. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (8,4) must be 7. Updating row8: [8,6,1,3,7,0,2,5,9]. Now missing in row8 is 4 in cell (8,5). Column5 has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:0, row2:0, row3:6, row4:7, row5:5, row6:1, row7:9, row8:0. Existing are 2,6,7,5,1,9. Missing are 3,4,8. Row8's missing is 4. Therefore, cell (8,5) is 4. Updating row8: [8,6,1,3,7,4,2,5,9]. Now row8 is complete.\n\nNow, let's check Row 1: [0, 0, 2, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1, 3]. Missing numbers are 4,7,8. Let's check cells.\n\nCell (1,0): column0 has existing numbers: row0:6, row1:0, row2:5, row3:4, row4:9, row5:1, row6:2, row7:3, row8:8. Existing are 6,5,4,9,1,2,3,8. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (1,0) must be 7. Updating row1: [7, 0, 2, 5, 9, 0, 6, 1, 3]. Now missing in row1 are 4 and 8 in cells (1,1) and (1,5).\n\nFor cell (1,1): column1 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:0, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:3, row6:5, row7:7, row8:6. Existing are 1,2,8,3,5,7,6. Missing are 4,9. Row1's missing here is 4 or 8. Intersection is 4. Therefore, cell (1,1) is 4. Updating row1: [7,4,2,5,9,0,6,1,3]. Now missing in row1 is 8 in cell (1,5). Column5 for cell (1,5) has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:0, row2:0, row3:6, row4:7, row5:5, row6:1, row7:9, row8:4. Existing are 2,6,7,5,1,9,4. Missing are 3,8. Row1's missing is 8. Therefore, cell (1,5) is 8. Updating row1: [7,4,2,5,9,8,6,1,3]. Now row1 is complete.\n\nNow, looking at Row 2: [5, 0, 8, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2]. Missing numbers are 3,4,7,9. Let's check cells.\n\nCell (2,1): column1 has existing numbers: row0:1, row1:4, row2:0, row3:2, row4:8, row5:3, row6:5, row7:7, row8:6. Existing are 1,4,2,8,3,5,7,6. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (2,1) must be 9. Updating row2: [5,9,8,6,1,0,0,0,2]. Now missing in row2 are 3,4,7 in cells (2,5), (2,6), (2,7).\n\nFor cell (2,5): column5 has existing numbers: row0:2, row1:8, row2:0, row3:6, row4:7, row5:5, row6:1, row7:9, row8:4. Existing are 2,8,6,7,5,1,9,4. Missing is 3. Therefore, cell (2,5) is 3. Updating row2: [5,9,8,6,1,3,0,0,2]. Now missing in row2 are 4 and 7 in cells (2,6) and (2,7).\n\nLooking at cell (2,6): column6 has existing numbers: row0:5, row1:6, row2:0, row3:1, row4:4, row5:9, row6:3, row7:8, row8:2. Existing are 5,6,1,4,9,3,8,2. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (2,6) must be 7. Updating row2: [5,9,8,6,1,3,7,0,2]. Now missing in row2 is 4 in cell (2,7).

Therefore, cell (2,7) is 4. Updating row2: [5,9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2]. Now row2 is complete.\n\nNow, only Row 0 remains: [6, 1, 0, 0, 4, 2, 5, 0, 0]. Let's check what's left. Missing numbers are 3,7,8,9. Let's look at cells (0,2), (0,3), (0,7), (0,8).\n\nFor cell (0,2): column2 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:2, row2:8, row3:5, row4:6, row5:7, row6:9, row7:4, row8:1. Existing are 2,8,5,6,7,9,4,1. Missing is 3. Therefore, cell (0,2) must be 3. Updating row0: [6,1,3,0,4,2,5,0,0].

Existing are 5,6,9,1,4,8,2,3. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (0,3) must be 7. Updating row0: [6,1,3,7,4,2,5,0,0]. Now missing in row0 are 8 and 9 in cells (0,7) and (0,8).\n\nFor cell (0,7): column7 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:1, row2:4, row3:3, row4:2, row5:8, row6:7, row7:6, row8:5. Existing are 1,4,3,2,8,7,6,5. Missing is 9. Therefore, cell (0,7) must be 9. Updating row0: [6,1,3,7,4,2,5,9,0]. Now missing in row0 is 8 in cell (0,8). Column8 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:3, row2:2, row3:7, row4:5, row5:6, row6:4, row7:1, row8:9. Existing are 3,2,7,5,6,4,1,9. Missing is 8. Therefore, cell (0,8) is 8. Updating row0: [6,1,3,7,4,2,5,9,8]. Now row0 is complete.\n\nLet me verify all rows, columns, and blocks to ensure there are no duplicates and all numbers 1-9 are present.\n\nRow 0: [6,1,3,7,4,2,5,9,8] – all unique, 1-9.\nRow 1: [7,4,2,5,9,8,6,1,3] – all unique.\nRow 2: [5,9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2] – all unique.\nRow 3: [4,2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7] – all unique.\nRow 4: [9,8,6,1,3,7,4,2,5] – all unique.\nRow 5: [1,3,7,4,2,5,9,8,6] – all unique.\nRow 6: [2,5,9,8,6,1,3,7,4] – all unique.\nRow 7: [3,7,4,2,5,9,8,6,1] – all unique.\nRow 8: [8,6,1,3,7,4,2,5,9] – all unique.\n\nNow check columns:\n\nColumn 0: 6,7,5,4,9,1,2,3,8 – all unique.\nColumn 1: 1,4,9,2,8,3,5,7,6 – all unique.\nColumn 2: 3,2,8,5,6,7,9,4,1 – all unique.\nColumn 3: 7,5,6,9,1,4,8,2,3 – all unique.\nColumn 4: 4,9,1,8,3,2,6,5,7 – all unique.\nColumn 5: 2,8,3,6,7,5,1,9,4 – all unique.\nColumn 6: 5,6,7,1,4,9,3,8,2 – all unique.\nColumn 7: 9,1,4,3,2,8,7,6,5 – all unique.\nColumn 8: 8,3,2,7,5,6,4,1,9 – all unique.\n\nCheck blocks:\n\nTop-left (0-2, 0-2):\n6,1,3\n7,4,2\n5,9,8 → all numbers 1-9.\n\nTop-middle (0-2, 3-5):\n7,4,2\n5,9,8\n6,1,3 → numbers 1-9.\n\nTop-right (0-2, 6-8):\n5,9,8\n6,1,3\n7,4,2 → all numbers.\n\nMiddle-left (3-5, 0-2):\n4,2,5\n9,8,6\n1,3,7 → all numbers.\n\nMiddle-middle (3-5, 3-5):\n9,8,6\n1,3,7\n4,2,5 → all numbers.\n\nMiddle-right (3-5, 6-8):\n1,3,7\n4,2,5\n9,8,6 → all numbers.\n\nBottom-left (6-8, 0-2):\n2,5,9\n3,7,4\n8,6,1 → all numbers.\n\nBottom-middle (6-8, 3-5):\n8,6,1\n2,5,9\n3,7,4 → all numbers.\n\nBottom-right (6-8, 6-8):\n3,7,4\n8,6,1\n2,5,9 → all numbers.\n\nLooks like everything checks out.

    "response": [
      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where the zeros are. Each row, column, and 3x3 block must contain numbers 1-9 without repetition. Let me start by scanning each row, column, and block for obvious missing numbers.\n\nStarting with the first row: [0, 0, 1, 5, 8, 0, 6, 7, 0]. The existing numbers are 1,5,6,7,8. Missing are 2,3,4,9. Let's check the columns for each zero position. The first cell (row 1, column 1) is in block 1. Let's see what's in that block. Block 1 includes rows 1-3 and columns 1-3. Looking at the first three rows and columns:\n\nRow 1: 0, 0, 1\nRow 2: 5, 0, 3\nRow 3: 6, 7, 0\n\nSo existing numbers in block 1 are 1,3,5,6,7. Missing are 2,4,8,9. Wait, but in the first row's first two columns, we need to find numbers that are not in the block. Let's check column 1 for row 1. Column 1 has 0 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3),7 (row4),4 (row5), etc. Wait, column 1 entries are:\n\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 5\nRow 3: 6\nRow 4: 7\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 4\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 3\nRow 9: 0\n\nSo existing numbers in column 1 are 3,4,5,6,7. Missing are 1,2,8,9. But in row 1's first column, it's part of block 1 which already has 1 in row1, column3. So column 1 can't have 1 again. Therefore, possible numbers for row1, column1 are 2,8,9. But block 1 needs 2,4,8,9. Let's see if there are other constraints. Maybe looking at other cells in the row first.\n\nLooking at row1, column6 (which is 0). Column6 has entries:\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2: 2\nRow3: 0\nRow4:5\nRow5:9\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:0\nRow9:7\n\nSo column6 has 2,5,7,8,9. Missing are 1,3,4,6. But row1's column6 is in block2 (columns 4-6, rows 1-3). Block2 has existing numbers: row1 has 5,8 in columns4 and 5. Row2 has 6,7,2 in columns4-6. Row3's columns4-6 are 0s. Let me check existing numbers in block2. Numbers present are 2,5,6,7,8. Missing are 1,3,4,9. So row1, column6 must be one of these. Also, row1's existing numbers are 1,5,6,7,8. So column6 can't be 1 (already in row1?), no, row1's existing numbers are in other columns. Wait, row1's existing numbers are 1 (col3), 5 (col4), 8 (col5), 6 (col7), 7 (col8). So missing in row1 are 2,3,4,9. Therefore, column6 must be one of those. But column6's missing are 1,3,4,6. Wait, there's a conflict here. The row needs 2,3,4,9 in column6, but column6's missing are 1,3,4,6. So the intersection is 3 and 4. So possible numbers for row1, column6 are 3 or 4. Let me check block2. Block2's missing are 1,3,4,9. So if column6's cell is 3 or 4, that's possible. Hmm. Maybe I need to look elsewhere first.\n\nLet me check if there are cells with only one possible number. Let's look at row7, column1. The cell is 0. Column1 has existing numbers 5,6,7,4,3. So missing are 1,2,8,9. Block for row7, column1 is block7 (rows7-9, columns1-3). Block7 has row7: 0,9,0; row8:3,6,7; row9:0,0,8. So existing numbers in block7 are 3,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1,2,4,5. Wait, column1 for row7 is in block7. So possible numbers for row7, column1 are 1,2,4,5. But column1 can't have 1,2,4,5? Wait column1 has existing numbers 5 (row2), 6 (row3),7 (row4),4 (row6),3 (row8). So column1's missing are 1,2,8,9. Therefore, for row7, column1, possible numbers are the intersection between block7's missing (1,2,4,5) and column1's missing (1,2,8,9). So the intersection is 1,2. So row7, column1 can be 1 or 2. Let me check if there's another constraint. Let's look at row7. The row is [0,9,0,1,5,8,3,6,7]. Existing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4. Wait, row7 has 0 in column1 and column3. So missing numbers are 2 and 4. Therefore, row7, column1 must be 2 or 4. But earlier analysis said possible 1 or 2. There's a conflict here. Wait, why? Because row7's missing numbers are 2 and 4. Therefore, column1's cell must be 2 or 4. But column1's missing numbers are 1,2,8,9. So how can it be 2 or 4? Oh wait, column1's existing numbers are 5,6,7,4 (row6),3 (row8). Wait row6 column1 is 4. So column1 has 4 already. Therefore, column1 can't have 4 again. So the missing numbers in column1 are 1,2,8,9. Therefore, row7, column1 can't be 4. But row7's missing numbers are 2 and 4. Wait, this suggests a contradiction. Let me recheck. Row7's existing numbers: [0,9,0,1,5,8,3,6,7]. So numbers present are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2 and 4. So the two zeros in row7 must be 2 and 4. But column1 for row7 is in column1, which has existing numbers 5,6,7,4 (row6, column1 is 4?), let me check the original board again. Original board's row6 is [4, 1, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 9]. So column1 for row6 is 4. Yes. So column1 has 4 already. Therefore, row7, column1 can't be 4. Therefore, it must be 2. Because row7's missing are 2 and 4. So row7, column1 is 2, and the other zero in row7 (column3) is 4. Let me check if that works. Let's tentatively put 2 in row7, column1. Then row7 would be [2,9,4,...]. Let me check column1 for 2: column1 now has 2, which wasn't there before. So that's okay. And block7 (rows7-9, columns1-3) would have 2 added. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo row7, column1 is 2. Now, row7's other zero is column3, which must be 4. Let me check if that's allowed. Column3 for row7 is column3. Let's check column3's existing numbers. Column3 entries:\n\nRow1:1\nRow2:3\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:5\nRow7:4 (now)\nRow8:7\nRow9:8\n\nSo column3 has 1,3,4,5,7,8. Missing are 2,6,9. But row7's column3 is 4, which is allowed. Also, block7 now has 2,9,4 in row7's first three columns. That's okay. So that seems okay. So row7 becomes [2,9,4,1,5,8,3,6,7].\n\nNow, let's look at row9, which is [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 4]. Existing numbers are 2,4,7,8. Missing are 1,3,5,6,9. Let's check column1 for row9 (row9, column1). Column1 now has 2 (row7), so missing are 1,8,9. Because column1's existing numbers are 5,6,7,4,3,2. Wait, original column1 entries after our change:\n\nRow1: 0\nRow2:5\nRow3:6\nRow4:7\nRow5:0\nRow6:4\nRow7:2\nRow8:3\nRow9:0\n\nSo existing numbers in column1 are 2,3,4,5,6,7. Missing are 1,8,9. So row9, column1 can be 1,8,9. Also, block for row9, column1 is block7 (rows7-9, columns1-3). Block7 now has 2,9,4 in row7; row8 has 3,6,7; row9 has [?, ?, 8...]. Existing numbers in block7 are 2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1 and 5. Wait, block7 is rows7-9, columns1-3. Let me check again:\n\nRow7: 2,9,4\nRow8:3,6,7\nRow9: ?, ?, 8\n\nSo existing numbers in block7 are 2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1 and 5. Therefore, row9's column1 and column2 must be 1 and 5. Since row9's column1 is in block7, and column2 is also in block7. Let's check column1 for row9. Possible values are 1,8,9. But block7 needs 1 or 5. Therefore, row9, column1 must be 1 (since 5 is not in column1's missing). Wait, column1's missing are 1,8,9. So only 1 is possible for row9, column1. Because block7 needs either 1 or 5. So row9, column1 is 1, and then row9, column2 must be 5 (since block7 needs 1 and 5, and we already placed 1 in column1). Let's check that. So row9 becomes [1,5,8,...]. Now, column2 for row9 is 5. Let me check column2's existing numbers. Column2 entries:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:7\nRow4:0\nRow5:3\nRow6:1\nRow7:9\nRow8:6\nRow9:5\n\nExisting numbers in column2 are 1,3,5,6,7,9. Missing are 2,4,8. Wait, but row9's column2 is 5, which is allowed. So that's okay. Now, block7 has 1 and 5 added, completing it. So row9's first two columns are 1 and 5. Now, row9 is [1,5,8, 0, 0, 7, 2, 0, 4]. Now, let's look at the missing numbers in row9: existing are 1,2,4,5,7,8. Missing are 3,6,9. Let's look at column4 for row9 (which is 0). Column4 entries:\n\nRow1:5\nRow2:6\nRow3:0\nRow4:4\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:1\nRow8:0\nRow9:0\n\nExisting numbers in column4 are 1,4,5,6. Missing are 2,3,7,8,9. But row9's column4 is part of block8 (rows7-9, columns4-6). Block8 has row7:1,5,8; row8:0,9,0; row9:0, 0, 7. Let me check existing numbers in block8. Block8's existing numbers: 1,5,8,9,7. Missing are 2,3,4,6. But row9's column4 is in block8. Let me think. For row9's column4, possible numbers must be in row9's missing (3,6,9) and column4's missing (2,3,7,8,9). The intersection is 3,9. Also, block8's missing are 2,3,4,6. So the intersection for row9's column4 is 3. Because 3 is in both row9's missing and block8's missing. Therefore, row9, column4 must be 3. Let me check. If I put 3 in row9, column4, then column4 now has 3 added. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes, column4 didn't have 3 before. Now, row9's column4 is 3. Now, row9's missing numbers are 6 and 9. Let's look at row9's column5 (currently 0). Column5 entries:\n\nRow1:8\nRow2:7\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:5\nRow8:9\nRow9:0\n\nExisting numbers in column5 are 1,2,3,5,7,8,9. Missing are 4,6. But row9's column5 is part of block8, which now has 1,3,5,8,7,9 (from row9's column4 being 3). Block8's missing are 2,3,4,6. Wait, I think I need to recheck block8 after adding 3. Block8 now has row7:1,5,8; row8: ?,9,?; row9:3, ?,7. Let me think. Block8 includes columns 4-6 and rows 7-9. So existing numbers in block8 are 1 (row7, col4), 5 (row7, col5), 8 (row7, col6), 9 (row8, col5), 3 (row9, col4), 7 (row9, col6). Missing are 2,4,6. Therefore, row9's column5 (which is in block8) can be 4 or 6, since column5's missing are 4 and 6. But row9's missing are 6 and 9. Wait, row9's existing numbers are 1,5,8,3,7,2,4 (wait no, row9 is [1,5,8,3, 0,7,2, 0,4]. Existing numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing are 6,9. Therefore, row9's column5 must be 6 or 9. But column5's missing are 4 and 6. So the intersection is only 6. Therefore, row9's column5 is 6. Let me check. If I put 6 in row9, column5, then column5 has 6 added. That's allowed. Then, row9's column5 is 6, and the remaining missing number is 9 in row9's column8. Let's check column8 for row9. Column8 entries:\n\nRow1:7\nRow2:0\nRow3:8\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:6\nRow8:0\nRow9:0\n\nExisting numbers in column8 are 1,6,7,8. Missing are 2,3,4,5,9. Row9's column8 needs to be 9 (since row9's missing is 9). Let me check if that's allowed. Column8 doesn't have 9 yet. So yes. Therefore, row9 becomes [1,5,8,3,6,7,2,9,4]. Let me check if that works. Yes, all numbers in row9 are unique. Now, let's update the board with these changes.\n\nNow, let's look at other parts. Let's check row8: [3, 6, 7, 0, 9, 0, 1, 0, 8]. Existing numbers are 1,3,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4,5. Let's check column4 for row8 (which is 0). Column4 has existing numbers 5,6,4,1,3 (from row9's column4=3). Missing in column4 are 2,7,8,9. Wait, column4's existing numbers are 5 (row1),6 (row2),0 (row3),4 (row4),0 (row5),0 (row6),1 (row7),0 (row8),3 (row9). Wait, no, row9's column4 is 3. So column4 has 5,6,4,1,3. So missing are 2,7,8,9. For row8's column4, which is part of block8 (rows7-9, columns4-6). Block8 now has row9's column4=3, column5=6, column6=7. Block8's existing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4. Wait, earlier I thought missing were 2,4,6 but after adding 3 and 6, perhaps. Let me recheck. Block8 includes columns4-6 for rows7-9. Existing numbers:\n\nRow7: 1 (col4),5 (col5),8 (col6)\nRow8: 0 (col4),9 (col5), 0 (col6)\nRow9:3 (col4),6 (col5),7 (col6)\n\nSo existing numbers in block8 are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4. Therefore, row8's column4 must be 2 or 4. Also, row8's column4 is in column4, which has missing 2,7,8,9. So intersection is 2. Therefore, row8, column4 must be 2. Let me check. If I put 2 in row8, column4, then column4 has 2 added. Now, row8 becomes [3,6,7,2,9,0,1,0,8]. Now, row8's missing numbers are 4 and 5 (since existing are 1,2,3,6,7,8,9). Let's look at row8's column6 (which is 0). Column6 entries:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:2\nRow3:0\nRow4:5\nRow5:9\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:0\nRow9:7\n\nExisting numbers in column6 are 2,5,7,8,9. Missing are 1,3,4,6. But row8's missing are 4 and 5. Wait, row8's missing numbers are 4 and 5. But column6's missing are 1,3,4,6. So the intersection is 4. Therefore, row8's column6 must be 4. Let me check. If I put 4 in row8, column6, then column6 has 4 added. Now, row8 becomes [3,6,7,2,9,4,1,0,8]. Now, row8's missing is 5 in column8. Column8 for row8 is 0. Column8's existing numbers are 7 (row1), 0 (row2), 8 (row3), 0 (row4), 1 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 0 (row8), 9 (row9). Existing are 1,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,3,4,5. Row8's column8 needs to be 5. Let me check if allowed. Column8 doesn't have 5 yet. So yes. Therefore, row8 becomes [3,6,7,2,9,4,1,5,8]. Now, row8 is complete.\n\nNow, let's check row3: [6,7,0,0,0,0,5,8,3]. Existing numbers are 3,5,6,7,8. Missing are 1,2,4,9. Let's check column3 for row3 (which is 0). Column3 entries:\n\nRow1:1\nRow2:3\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:5\nRow7:4\nRow8:7\nRow9:8\n\nExisting numbers in column3 are 1,3,4,5,7,8. Missing are 2,6,9. But row3's missing are 1,2,4,9. So intersection is 2,9. So possible values for row3, column3 are 2 or 9. Let's check block for row3, column3 (block1: rows1-3, columns1-3). Block1's existing numbers: row1 has 0,0,1; row2 has 5,0,3; row3 has 6,7,0. Existing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7. Missing are 2,4,8,9. So row3, column3 can be 2,9. Let's see if there are other constraints. Let's look at row3. The row is [6,7,?, ?, ?, ?,5,8,3]. Let's look at other cells in the row. For example, column4 (row3, column4) is 0. Column4 has existing numbers 5,6,4,1,3,2 (from row8's column4=2). So column4's existing are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Missing are 7,8,9. But row3's column4 is part of block2 (rows1-3, columns4-6). Block2's existing numbers: row1 has 5,8,0; row2 has 6,7,2; row3 has 0,0,0. Existing in block2 are 2,5,6,7,8. Missing are 1,3,4,9. Therefore, row3's column4 must be one of those. Also, column4's missing are 7,8,9. Wait, there's no overlap. That suggests a problem. Wait, column4's existing numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So missing are 7,8,9. Block2's missing are 1,3,4,9. So the intersection is 9. Therefore, row3's column4 must be 9. Let me check. If I put 9 in row3, column4, then column4 has 9 added. Now, row3 becomes [6,7,0,9,0,0,5,8,3]. Now, block2 has 9 added. Now, let's check row3's column4=9. Now, block2's existing numbers include 9. Now, looking back at row3's column3, which is 0. Possible values are 2 or 9. But 9 is already in block2 (row3, column4), so row3's column3 can't be 9. Therefore, it must be 2. Let me put 2 in row3, column3. Now, row3 becomes [6,7,2,9,0,0,5,8,3]. Now, column3 has 2 added, which is allowed. Now, row3's missing numbers are 1,4 (since existing are 2,3,5,6,7,8,9). Let's look at the remaining cells in row3: columns5,6. Let's check column5 for row3 (which is 0). Column5 entries:\n\nRow1:8\nRow2:7\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:2\nRow6:3\nRow7:5\nRow8:9\nRow9:6\n\nExisting numbers in column5 are 1,2,3,5,7,8,9. Missing are 4,6. Row3's column5 is in block2 (columns4-6). Block2 now has 9 in column4, and existing numbers in block2 are 5,8 (row1), 6,7,2 (row2), 9, ?, ? (row3). So block2's existing numbers are 2,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1,3,4. Wait, row3's column5 is part of block2. So possible values for row3's column5 must be in block2's missing (1,3,4) and column5's missing (4,6). Intersection is 4. Therefore, row3's column5 is 4. Let me check. If I put 4 in row3, column5, then column5 has 4 added. Now, row3 becomes [6,7,2,9,4,0,5,8,3]. Now, row3's missing is 1 in column6. Column6 for row3 is 0. Column6's existing numbers are 2,5,7,8,9,4 (from row8's column6=4). Missing are 1,3,6. But row3's column6 needs to be 1. Let me check if allowed. Column6 doesn't have 1 yet. Yes. So row3's column6 is 1. Now, row3 is [6,7,2,9,4,1,5,8,3]. Let me verify this. Yes, all numbers in row3 are unique. Now, block2 has 1 added in row3, column6. Block2 is now complete with numbers 1,2,5,6,7,8,9, etc.\n\nNow, let's look at row2: [5, 0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 0, 0, 0]. Existing numbers are 2,3,5,6,7. Missing are 1,4,8,9. Let's check column2 (row2, column2 is 0). Column2 entries:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:7\nRow4:0\nRow5:3\nRow6:1\nRow7:9\nRow8:6\nRow9:5\n\nExisting numbers in column2 are 1,3,5,6,7,9. Missing are 2,4,8. So row2's column2 can be 2,4,8. Also, block1 (rows1-3, columns1-3) for row2, column2. Block1's existing numbers: row1 has [0,0,1], row2 has [5, ?, 3], row3 has [6,7,2]. Existing numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,7. Missing are 4,8,9. Therefore, row2's column2 must be one of 4,8,9. But column2's missing are 2,4,8. The intersection is 4,8. So possible values are 4 or 8. Let's see if there are other constraints. Let's look at row2's other cells. For example, column7 (0), column8 (0), column9 (0). Let's see if we can find other cells in row2 that have only one possibility.\n\nLooking at column9 for row2 (which is 0). Column9 entries:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:3\nRow4:0\nRow5:5\nRow6:9\nRow7:7\nRow8:8\nRow9:4\n\nExisting numbers in column9 are 3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 1,2,6. Row2's missing numbers are 1,4,8,9. So column9's missing for row2 must be 1 or 2 or 6, but row2's missing are 1,4,8,9. The intersection is only 1. Therefore, row2's column9 must be 1. Let me check. If I put 1 in row2, column9, then column9 has 1 added. Now, row2 becomes [5, 0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 0, 0, 1]. Now, row2's missing numbers are 4,8,9 (since 1 is filled). Let's check if this helps with other cells. Now, column9 is filled for row2.\n\nNow, looking at row2's column7 (which is 0). Column7 entries:\n\nRow1:6\nRow2:0\nRow3:5\nRow4:8\nRow5:4\nRow6:7\nRow7:3\nRow8:1\nRow9:2\n\nExisting numbers in column7 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing is 9. Therefore, row2's column7 must be 9. Because column7 is missing 9. Let me check. Yes, if I put 9 in row2, column7. Now, row2 becomes [5, 0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 0, 1]. Now, row2's missing numbers are 4,8 in columns2 and 8. Let's look at column8 for row2 (which is 0). Column8 entries:\n\nRow1:7\nRow2:0\nRow3:8\nRow4:0\nRow5:1\nRow6:0\nRow7:6\nRow8:5\nRow9:9\n\nExisting numbers in column8 are 1,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,3,4. Row2's missing are 4 and 8. The intersection is 4. Therefore, row2's column8 must be 4. Let me check. Column8 doesn't have 4 yet. Yes. So row2 becomes [5, 0, 3, 6, 7, 2, 9, 4, 1]. Now, the only missing number in row2 is column2, which must be 8 (since row2's missing numbers were 4 and 8, and 4 is filled). Let me check. Column2 for row2 is 0. Column2's existing numbers are 1,3,5,6,7,9, now with row2's column2 being 8. Let me check if allowed. Column2 didn't have 8 before. Yes. And block1 for row2, column2 is in block1. Block1's existing numbers are 5, ?, 3 in row2. Now adding 8 to row2's column2. Block1's existing numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing are 4,9. Wait, row2's column2 is 8, which is allowed. So row2 is now [5,8,3,6,7,2,9,4,1]. Let me check if all numbers are unique. Yes, 5,8,3,6,7,2,9,4,1. All good.\n\nNow, let's look at row1: [0, 0, 1, 5, 8, 0, 6, 7, 0]. Existing numbers are 1,5,6,7,8. Missing are 2,3,4,9. Let's check column1 and column2 for row1. Column1 for row1 is 0. Column1's existing numbers are 2 (row7),3 (row8),4 (row6),5 (row2),6 (row3),7 (row4). Missing are 1,8,9. Wait, original column1 entries after changes:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:5\nRow3:6\nRow4:7\nRow5:0\nRow6:4\nRow7:2\nRow8:3\nRow9:1\n\nSo existing numbers in column1 are 1 (row9),2,3,4,5,6,7. Missing are 8,9. Therefore, row1's column1 must be 8 or 9. Let's check block1 for row1, column1. Block1 includes row1's columns1-3. Existing numbers in block1 are row1: [?, ?,1], row2: [5,8,3], row3: [6,7,2]. So existing numbers are 1,2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing are 4,9. Therefore, row1's column1 must be either 4 or 9. But column1's missing are 8,9. So the intersection is 9. Therefore, row1's column1 must be 9. Let me check. If I put 9 in row1, column1, then column1 has 9 added. Now, row1 becomes [9, 0, 1, 5, 8, 0, 6, 7, 0]. Now, block1's missing is 4. So row1's column2 must be 4. Because row1's missing numbers are 2,3,4,9. Now, with 9 filled, missing are 2,3,4. And block1's missing is 4. Therefore, row1's column2 must be 4. Let me check column2 for row1. Column2's existing numbers are 8 (row2),7 (row3),3 (row5),1 (row6),9 (row7),6 (row8),5 (row9). So adding 4 to column2 is allowed. Therefore, row1 becomes [9,4,1,5,8,0,6,7,0]. Now, row1's missing numbers are 2,3. The remaining zeros are in column6 and column9.\n\nLet's look at column6 for row1 (which is 0). Column6 entries:\n\nRow1:0\nRow2:2\nRow3:1\nRow4:5\nRow5:9\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:4\nRow9:7\n\nExisting numbers in column6 are 1,2,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 3,6. Row1's missing numbers are 2,3. But column6's missing are 3,6. So row1's column6 must be 3. Let me check. Yes, because 3 is in both. Therefore, row1's column6 is 3. Now, row1 becomes [9,4,1,5,8,3,6,7,0]. Now, the only missing number in row1 is column9, which must be 2 (since row1's missing is 2). Column9 for row1 is 0. Column9's existing numbers are 1 (row2),3 (row3),5 (row5),9 (row6),7 (row7),8 (row8),4 (row9). Adding 2 is allowed. Therefore, row1's column9 is 2. Now, row1 is [9,4,1,5,8,3,6,7,2]. Let me check if all numbers are unique. Yes.\n\nNow, let's check row5: [0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5]. Existing numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,9. Missing are 6,7,8. Let's look at column1 for row5 (which is 0). Column1's existing numbers are 9 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3),7 (row4),0 (row5),4 (row6),2 (row7),3 (row8),1 (row9). Missing in column1 are 8. Therefore, row5's column1 must be 8. Let me check. Yes, because column1 has 8 missing. So row5 becomes [8,3,0,0,2,9,4,1,5]. Now, row5's missing numbers are 6,7 in columns3 and 4. Let's look at column3 for row5 (which is 0). Column3 entries:\n\nRow1:1\nRow2:3\nRow3:2\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:5\nRow7:4\nRow8:7\nRow9:8\n\nExisting numbers in column3 are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8. Missing are 6,9. Row5's missing are 6,7. The intersection is 6. Therefore, row5's column3 must be 6. Let me check. Column3 doesn't have 6 yet. Yes. So row5 becomes [8,3,6,0,2,9,4,1,5]. Now, the remaining missing number in row5 is 7 in column4. Column4 for row5 is 0. Column4's existing numbers are 5 (row1),6 (row2),9 (row3),4 (row4),0 (row5),0 (row6),1 (row7),2 (row8),3 (row9). Existing are 1,2,3,4,5,6,9. Missing are 7,8. But row5's column4 must be 7. Let me check if allowed. Yes, because column4 doesn't have 7 yet. So row5 becomes [8,3,6,7,2,9,4,1,5]. Now, row5 is complete.\n\nNow, let's check row4: [7, 0, 0, 4, 1, 5, 8, 0, 0]. Existing numbers are 1,4,5,7,8. Missing are 2,3,6,9. Let's check column2 for row4 (which is 0). Column2's existing numbers are 4 (row1),8 (row2),7 (row3),0 (row4),3 (row5),1 (row6),9 (row7),6 (row8),5 (row9). Missing in column2 are 2. Wait, column2 has existing numbers 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing is 2. Therefore, row4's column2 must be 2. Let me check. Yes, because column2 is missing 2. So row4 becomes [7,2,0,4,1,5,8,0,0]. Now, row4's missing numbers are 3,6,9 in columns3,8,9. Let's look at column3 for row4 (which is 0). Column3 entries have existing numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing is 9. Therefore, row4's column3 must be 9. Let me check. Yes, column3 is missing 9. So row4 becomes [7,2,9,4,1,5,8,0,0]. Now, row4's missing are 3,6 in columns8 and 9. Let's check column8 for row4 (which is 0). Column8's existing numbers are 7 (row1),4 (row2),8 (row3),0 (row4),1 (row5),0 (row6),6 (row7),5 (row8),9 (row9). Existing are 1,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,3. Row4's missing are 3,6. The intersection is 3. Therefore, row4's column8 must be 3. Let me check. Yes, column8 doesn't have 3. So row4 becomes [7,2,9,4,1,5,8,3,0]. Now, the remaining missing number in row4 is 6 in column9. Column9 for row4 is 0. Column9's existing numbers are 2 (row1),1 (row2),3 (row3),5 (row5),9 (row6),7 (row7),8 (row8),4 (row9). Missing are 6. Therefore, row4's column9 is 6. Now, row4 is [7,2,9,4,1,5,8,3,6]. Let me check if all numbers are unique. Yes.\n\nFinally, let's check row6: [4, 1, 5, 0, 3, 0, 7, 0, 9]. Existing numbers are 1,3,4,5,7,9. Missing are 2,6,8. Let's look at column4 for row6 (which is 0). Column4's existing numbers are 5 (row1),6 (row2),9 (row3),4 (row4),1 (row7),2 (row8),3 (row9). Missing are 7,8. But row6's missing are 2,6,8. The intersection is 8. Therefore, row6's column4 must be 8. Let me check. Column4 doesn't have 8 yet. Yes. So row6 becomes [4,1,5,8,3,0,7,0,9]. Now, row6's missing are 2,6 in columns6 and 8. Let's look at column6 for row6 (which is 0). Column6 entries have existing numbers 3 (row1),2 (row2),1 (row3),5 (row4),9 (row5),0 (row6),8 (row7),4 (row8),7 (row9). Existing are 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 6. Therefore, row6's column6 must be 6. Let me check. Yes. So row6 becomes [4,1,5,8,3,6,7,0,9]. Now, the remaining missing number in row6 is 2 in column8. Column8 for row6 is 0. Column8's existing numbers are 7,4,8,3,1,6,5,9. Missing are 2. Therefore, row6's column8 is 2. Now, row6 is [4,1,5,8,3,6,7,2,9]. Let me check if all numbers are unique. Yes.\n\nNow, let me verify the entire board to ensure all rows, columns, and blocks are valid.\n\nFinal board:\n\nRow1: [9,4,1,5,8,3,6,7,2]\nRow2: [5,8,3,6,7,2,9,4,1]\nRow3: [6,7,2,9,4,1,5,8,3]\nRow4: [7,2,9,4,1,5,8,3,6]\nRow5: [8,3,6,7,2,9,4,1,5]\nRow6: [4,1,5,8,3,6,7,2,9]\nRow7: [2,9,4,1,5,8,3,6,7]\nRow8: [3,6,7,2,9,4,1,5,8]\nRow9: [1,5,8,3,6,7,2,9,4]\n\nLet me check each row for uniqueness:\n\nRow1: all 1-9, no duplicates.\nRow2: same.\nRow3: same.\nRow4: same.\nRow5: same.\nRow6: same.\nRow7: same.\nRow8: same.\nRow9: same.\n\nColumns:\n\nCheck column1: 9,5,6,7,8,4,2,3,1 → all unique.\nColumn2: 4,8,7,2,3,1,9,6,5 → all unique.\nColumn3: 1,3,2,9,6,5,4,7,8 → all unique.\nColumn4: 5,6,9,4,7,8,1,2,3 → all unique.\nColumn5: 8,7,4,1,2,3,5,9,6 → all unique.\nColumn6: 3,2,1,5,9,6,8,4,7 → all unique.\nColumn7: 6,9,5,8,4,7,3,1,2 → all unique.\nColumn8: 7,4,8,3,1,2,6,5,9 → all unique.\nColumn9: 2,1,3,6,5,9,7,8,4 → all unique.\n\nBlocks:\n\nBlock1 (rows1-3, cols1-3):\n9,4,1\n5,8,3\n6,7,2 → all unique in each row and column within the block.\n\nBlock2 (rows1-3, cols4-6):\n5,8,3\n6,7,2\n9,4,1 → all unique.\n\nBlock3 (rows1-3, cols7-9):\n6,7,2\n9,4,1\n5,8,3 → all unique.\n\nBlock4 (rows4-6, cols1-3):\n7,2,9\n8,3,6\n4,1,5 → all unique.\n\nBlock5 (rows4-6, cols4-6):\n4,1,5\n7,2,9\n8,3,6 → all unique.\n\nBlock6 (rows4-6, cols7-9):\n8,3,6\n4,1,5\n7,2,9 → all unique.\n\nBlock7 (rows7-9, cols1-3):\n2,9,4\n3,6,7\n1,5,8 → all unique.\n\nBlock8 (rows7-9, cols4-6):\n1,5,8\n2,9,4\n3,6,7 → all unique.\n\nBlock9 (rows7-9, cols7-9):\n3,6,7\n1,5,8\n2,9,4 → all unique.\n\nEverything checks out.

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where to start. The goal is to fill in all the zeros with numbers from 1 to 9 so that each row, column, and 3x3 block contains all numbers without repetition. \n\nStarting with the first row: [8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 0]. The missing numbers here are 1, 5, 9. Let's check the columns and the 3x3 block for each empty cell. The first empty cell is in column 1 (index 1 if we start from 0). Let's see what's in column 1. Looking down column 1: the existing numbers are 8, 2, 7, 4, 3, 0 (second row's column 1 is 2?), wait no, the first row is row 0. Let me correct that. The first row is row 0, column indices 0-8. So column 1 (second column) has existing numbers: row 0: 0 (original is 0?), no, original first row is [8, 0, 4, ...]. So column 1 has in row 0: 0 (so needs to be filled), row 1: 2, row 2:7, row3:4, row4:3, row5:0 (original row5 is [7, 0, 8, ...], so column1 is 0 here), row6:8, row7:5, row8:6. So existing numbers in column 1 are 2,7,4,3,8,5,6. Missing are 1 and 9. But the first row's missing numbers are 1,5,9. So for the first cell (row 0, column 1), possible numbers are 1 and 9. Let me check the 3x3 block. The first row is in block 0 (top-left block). The block includes rows 0-2 and columns 0-2. Existing numbers in this block: row0 has 8, 0,4. Row1:5,2,0. Row2:6,7,1. So existing numbers are 8,4,5,2,6,7,1. Missing are 3,9. Wait, but the first row's missing numbers are 1,5,9? Wait, original row0 is [8,0,4,0,2,3,6,7,0]. So existing numbers in row0 are 8,4,2,3,6,7. So missing in row0 are 1,5,9. But in the block for row0, column1 (which is in the top-left 3x3 block), existing numbers are 8 (row0, col0), 5 (row1, col0), 2 (row1, col1), 6 (row2, col0), 7 (row2, col1), 1 (row2, col2). So missing in the block are 3, 4, 9? Wait, no, existing numbers in the block are 8,5,2,6,7,1,4 (row0, col2 is 4). So missing are 3 and 9. Therefore, the possible numbers for row0, col1 (which is in the block) must be 3 or 9? But earlier, the column 1 has missing 1 and 9. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the row0 missing numbers are 1,5,9. But the block (top-left) missing numbers are 3 and 9? Because existing numbers in the block are 8, 5, 2, 4, 6, 7, 1. Wait, row0 has 8, 0, 4. Row1 has 5,2,0. Row2 has 6,7,1. So existing numbers in the block are 8,4,5,2,6,7,1. So missing are 3, 9. Therefore, the possible numbers for row0, col1 must be 3 or 9. But column1's existing numbers are 2,7,4,3, etc. Wait, column1's existing numbers include 3? Let me check. Column1: row0:0 (unknown), row1:2, row2:7, row3:4, row4:3, row5:0, row6:8, row7:5, row8:6. So existing numbers in column1 are 2,7,4,3,8,5,6. So missing are 1 and 9. Therefore, for row0, col1, the possible numbers must be in both the block's missing (3,9) and column's missing (1,9). The only common number is 9. Therefore, row0, col1 must be 9. Because 9 is in both the column's missing and the block's missing. That makes sense. So row0, col1 is 9. Then, the row0 now has 8,9,4,... and missing numbers are 1 and 5 for the rest of the row.\n\nNext, looking at the last cell in row0: column8 is 0. The existing numbers in row0 are 8,9,4,2,3,6,7. Missing are 1 and 5. Let's check column8. Column8 has existing numbers: row0:0, row1:4, row2:3, row3:0, row4:5, row5:6, row6:7, row7:9, row8:2. So existing in column8 are 4,3,5,6,7,9,2. Missing are 1 and 8. Wait, but row0's missing are 1 and 5. Wait, column8's missing are 1 and 8. So for row0, column8, possible numbers are 1 (since 5 is not in column8's missing). Wait, row0's missing in row are 1 and 5. But column8's missing is 1 and 8. So the intersection is only 1. Therefore, row0, column8 must be 1. Then the remaining missing in row0 is 5 in the fourth column (column3). Let me check. Row0: [8,9,4, ?, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1]. The missing is 5 in column3. Let's check column3. Column3's existing numbers: row0: ?, row1: ?, row2:8, row3: ?, row4: ?, row5:9, row6:4, row7:3, row8:1. So existing in column3 are 8,9,4,3,1. So 5 is allowed here. Also, check the block. Column3 is part of the top-middle block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2). The block includes row0, columns 3-5: [0, 2, 3]. Existing numbers in the block: row0: column3 (unknown), 2, 3. Row1: columns 3-5: 0, 0, 0 (original row1 is [5,2,0, 0,7,0,...], so columns 3-5 are 0,7,0). Row2: columns 3-5 are 8, 0, 4. So existing numbers in the block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2) are 2,3,7,8,4. Missing are 1,5,6,9? Wait, maybe I need to recheck. Let me list all numbers in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). \n\nRow0: columns 3,4,5: 0 (original is 0?), 2, 3. \nRow1: columns 3,4,5: 0,7,0. \nRow2: columns 3,4,5: 8, 0,4. \n\nSo existing numbers in this block are 2,3,7,8,4. Missing are 1,5,6,9. But since row0's column3 is to be filled with 5, let's check if 5 is allowed. The block allows 5. So yes. Therefore, row0, column3 is 5. So the first row becomes [8,9,4,5,2,3,6,7,1]. That fills the first row.\n\nNow moving to the next rows. Let's look for cells that can be filled easily. Let's check row1: [5, 2, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 4]. Missing numbers in row1 are 1,3,6,8,9. Let's look for cells with few possibilities. \n\nLooking at column2 (third column) for row1 (row1, column2 is 0). The existing numbers in column2: row0:4, row1:0, row2:1, row3:5, row4:6, row5:8, row6:0, row7:0, row8:7. So existing numbers are 4,1,5,6,8,7. Missing are 2,3,9. But row1's missing numbers are 1,3,6,8,9. Wait, row1's existing numbers are 5,2, and then others. Let me check row1's existing numbers: 5,2, then zeros, then 7, zeros, then 4. So existing numbers in row1 are 5,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3,6,8,9. So for row1, column2, possible numbers must be in the row's missing (1,3,6,8,9) and column's missing (2,3,9). The intersection is 3 and 9. Also, check the block. Row1 is in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5?), no, row1 is in the top-middle block? Wait, row1 is in the top-center block? Let me clarify the blocks. The Sudoku is divided into 3x3 blocks. The blocks are:\n\nBlock 0: rows 0-2, columns 0-2 (top-left)\nBlock 1: rows 0-2, columns 3-5 (top-middle)\nBlock 2: rows 0-2, columns 6-8 (top-right)\nBlock 3: rows 3-5, columns 0-2 (middle-left)\nBlock 4: rows 3-5, columns 3-5 (middle-center)\nBlock 5: rows 3-5, columns 6-8 (middle-right)\nBlock 6: rows 6-8, columns 0-2 (bottom-left)\nBlock 7: rows 6-8, columns 3-5 (bottom-middle)\nBlock 8: rows 6-8, columns 6-8 (bottom-right)\n\nRow1 is in block 0 (columns 0-2 for columns 0-2?), no. Wait, row1, column2 is in block 0. So row1, column2 is in block 0. Let's check existing numbers in block 0. Block 0 has row0: 8,9,4; row1:5,2,0; row2:6,7,1. Existing numbers are 8,9,4,5,2,6,7,1. Missing is 3. Therefore, row1, column2 must be 3. Because the block is missing 3. So row1, column2 is 3. Now row1 becomes [5,2,3, 0,7, 0, 0, 0, 4]. Now the missing numbers in row1 are 1,6,8,9.\n\nNow looking at row1's columns. Let's check for other cells. Let's look at column3 (row1, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: row0:5, row1:0, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:9, row6:4, row7:3, row8:1. So existing in column3 are 5,8,9,4,3,1. Missing are 2,6,7. But row1's missing numbers are 1,6,8,9. Wait, no, row1's current missing numbers after adding 3 are 1,6,8,9? Let me recheck. Original row1 had 5,2,3, then zeros, 7, zeros, then 4. So existing numbers in row1 are 5,2,3,7,4. Missing numbers are 1,6,8,9. So for row1, column3, possible numbers must be in row's missing (1,6,8,9) and column's missing (2,6,7). The intersection is 6. So row1, column3 must be 6. Let me check the block. Block for row1, column3 is block1 (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in block1: row0: columns3-5 are 5,2,3. Row1: columns3-5 are 6,7,0. Row2: columns3-5 are 8, 0,4. So existing numbers are 5,2,3,6,7,8,4. Missing are 1 and 9. Wait, but according to column's check, row1, column3 is 6. But the block for column3 (block1) would have 6 added. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes, because in block1, the existing numbers before adding 6 are 5,2,3, etc. Adding 6 would be okay. Wait, but according to the block, the missing numbers are 1 and 9. So how can row1, column3 be 6? Because the block1's existing numbers after adding 6 would include 6, but that's allowed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-express.\n\nThe block1 (rows 0-2, columns3-5) includes row1, column3. Existing numbers in this block before adding anything are:\n\nRow0: columns3-5: 5 (row0, col3), 2 (row0, col4), 3 (row0, col5).\n\nRow1: columns3-5: 0 (col3), 7 (col4), 0 (col5).\n\nRow2: columns3-5: 8 (col3), 0 (col4), 4 (col5).\n\nSo existing numbers in the block are 5,2,3,7,8,4. Missing are 1, 6, 9. Wait, because numbers 1-9 must be present. So missing are 1,6,9. Therefore, if row1, column3 is 6, that's allowed. Because the block needs to have 6. So that works. So row1, column3 is 6. Now row1 becomes [5,2,3,6,7, 0, 0, 0, 4]. Now missing in row1 are 1,8,9.\n\nNext, looking at column5 (row1, column5 is 0). Column5's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:0, row2:4, row3:0, row4:8, row5:5, row6:2, row7:7, row8:0. So existing are 3,4,8,5,2,7. Missing are 1,6,9. Row1's missing are 1,8,9. The intersection is 1 and 9. Also check the block (block1). The block's missing are 1,6,9. So possible numbers for row1, column5 are 1,9. Let's check if there's any other constraints. Let's look at the column and row. \n\nIf we can find which one fits. Let's see if there's another cell in the same row or block that can narrow this down. For example, looking at row1's other empty cells: columns5,6,7. Let's check column6 (row1, column6 is 0). Column6's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:0, row2:0, row3:7, row4:0, row5:0, row6:3, row7:0, row8:4. Existing are 6,7,3,4. Missing are 1,2,5,8,9. Row1's missing are 1,8,9. So possible numbers here are 1,8,9. But this might not help yet. Let's go back to column5. \n\nLooking at the block1 (rows 0-2, columns3-5). The missing are 1,6,9. We already have row1, column3 as 6. So the remaining missing are 1 and 9. Therefore, in block1, the remaining cells (row1, column5; row2, column4; row1, column5 and row2, column4) must be 1 and 9. Let's check row2, column4. Original row2 is [6,7,1,8, 0,4, 0, 2, 3]. Let's check row2's missing numbers. Existing numbers in row2: 6,7,1,8,4,2,3. Missing are 5,9. Wait, but row2's column4 is 0. So possible numbers for row2, column4 are 5 and 9? But according to block1, it's supposed to be 1 or 9. There's a conflict here. Wait, row2's existing numbers are 6,7,1,8,4,2,3. So missing are 5,9. But the block1 requires that row2, column4 (which is in block1) must be 1 or 9. However, row2 can't have 1 because it already has 1 in column2. Wait, row2's existing numbers include 1 in column2. So row2's missing numbers are 5 and 9. Therefore, row2, column4 must be 5 or 9. But block1 requires that it's 1 or 9. Therefore, the only possible is 9. Because 9 is common in both. Therefore, row2, column4 must be 9. Then, block1's missing numbers are 1 and 9. Now that row2, column4 is 9, then the remaining missing in block1 is 1. Therefore, row1, column5 must be 1. \n\nSo row1, column5 is 1. Now row1 becomes [5,2,3,6,7,1, 0, 0, 4]. Missing in row1 are 8 and 9 (since previous missing were 1,8,9 and now 1 is filled). Now check columns 6 and 7 for row1. \n\nLooking at column6 (row1, column6 is 0). Column6's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:0, row2:0, row3:7, row4:0, row5:0, row6:3, row7:0, row8:4. Existing are 6,7,3,4. Missing are 1,2,5,8,9. Row1's missing are 8 and 9. So possible numbers are 8 and 9. Also check the block. Row1, column6 is in block2 (rows 0-2, columns6-8). Let's check existing numbers in block2. Original row0's columns6-8:6,7,1. Row1's columns6-8: 0, 0, 4. Row2's columns6-8: 0, 2, 3. Existing numbers are 6,7,1,4,2,3. Missing are 5,8,9. Therefore, possible numbers for row1, column6 are 5,8,9. But row1's missing are 8 and 9. So possible are 8 and 9. Let's see if there's any constraints. \n\nLooking at column6 for row1. Let's check if 8 or 9 can be placed. Also, check column7 (row1, column7 is 0). Column7's existing numbers: row0:7, row1:0, row2:2, row3:1, row4:4, row5:0, row6:0, row7:8, row8:0. Existing are 7,2,1,4,8. Missing are 3,5,6,9. Row1's missing are 8 and 9. So for column7, possible numbers are 9 only (since 8 is not in column7's missing). Therefore, row1, column7 must be 9. Because row1's missing includes 9, and column7 allows 9. Let me check the block. Block2 for row1, column7 is in block2. If we put 9 there, that's allowed. \n\nSo row1, column7 is 9. Now row1 becomes [5,2,3,6,7,1, 0, 9, 4]. Now missing in row1 is 8 (since 8 and 9 were the missing, now 9 is filled). Therefore, row1, column6 must be 8. Let me check column6. Column6's existing numbers include 6,7,3,4. Adding 8 is allowed. And block2's existing numbers now include 8. So yes. Therefore, row1 becomes [5,2,3,6,7,1,8,9,4]. \n\nNow row1 is filled. Let's check row2: [6,7,1,8,9,4, 0, 2, 3]. Missing number in row2 is 5 (since existing numbers are 6,7,1,8,9,4,2,3). So the missing is 5 in column6. Let's check column6. Column6's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:8, row2:0, row3:7, row4:0, row5:0, row6:3, row7:0, row8:4. Existing are 6,8,7,3,4. So 5 is allowed. Therefore, row2, column6 is 5. So row2 becomes [6,7,1,8,9,4,5,2,3]. \n\nNow moving to row3: [0,4,5,0,0,0,7,1,0]. Missing numbers in row3: existing are 4,5,7,1. So missing are 2,3,6,8,9. Let's look for cells with few possibilities. \n\nLooking at column0 (row3, column0 is 0). Column0's existing numbers: row0:8, row1:5, row2:6, row3:0, row4:2, row5:7, row6:0, row7:4, row8:0. Existing are 8,5,6,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3,9. But row3's missing are 2,3,6,8,9. The intersection is 3 and 9. Also check the block. Row3 is in block3 (rows3-5, columns0-2). Let's check existing numbers in block3. \n\nBlock3 includes rows3-5, columns0-2. Original row3: [0,4,5], row4: [2,3,6], row5: [7,0,8]. Existing numbers are 4,5,2,3,6,7,8. Missing are 1,9. Therefore, row3, column0 must be 1 or 9. But from column0's missing (1,3,9), and row's missing (3,9), the intersection is 3 and 9. Wait, there's a conflict here. Because block3's missing are 1 and 9. So row3, column0 can't be 3 because block3 doesn't have 3 missing. Therefore, this suggests an error in my earlier reasoning. Let me re-express.\n\nWait, block3's existing numbers: row3 has [0,4,5], row4: [2,3,6], row5: [7,0,8]. So existing numbers are 4,5,2,3,6,7,8. Missing are 1 and 9. Therefore, row3, column0 must be either 1 or 9. However, column0's existing numbers are 8,5,6,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3,9. So for row3, column0, possible numbers are 1 or 9 (from block) and column allows 1 and 9. Therefore, possible values are 1 and 9. Let's see if we can find more constraints. \n\nLooking at row3's other cells. For example, column3 (row3, column3 is 0). Let's check if there's any other cell that can be filled. Alternatively, maybe check other cells in row3. \n\nLooking at column8 (row3, column8 is 0). Column8's existing numbers: row0:1, row1:4, row2:3, row3:0, row4:5, row5:6, row6:7, row7:9, row8:2. Existing are 1,4,3,5,6,7,9,2. Missing is 8. Therefore, row3, column8 must be 8. Because column8's missing is 8 and row3's missing includes 8. So row3, column8 is 8. Now row3 becomes [0,4,5,0,0,0,7,1,8]. Now missing in row3 are 2,3,6,9. \n\nNow, looking back at column0 for row3. Possible numbers are 1 or 9. Let's check if there's a way to determine which. Let's look at the block3. Block3's missing are 1 and 9. The other cell in block3 that's missing is row5, column1 (row5, column1 is 0). Let me check row5. Original row5 is [7, 0, 8, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6]. So row5's existing numbers are 7,8,9,5,6. Missing are 1,2,3,4. Wait, but block3's missing are 1 and 9. Since row5, column1 is in block3 (columns0-2), and if row3, column0 is 1 or 9, and block3 needs 1 and 9. Let's see. If row3, column0 is 1, then block3's remaining missing is 9, which must be in row5, column1. If row3, column0 is 9, then block3's remaining missing is 1, which must be in row5, column1. Let's check if there are other constraints. \n\nLooking at row5, column1 (row5, column1 is 0). Let's check column1. Column1's existing numbers: row0:9, row1:2, row2:7, row3:4, row4:3, row5:0, row6:8, row7:5, row8:6. Existing are 9,2,7,4,3,8,5,6. Missing is 1. Therefore, row5, column1 must be 1. Because column1's missing is 1. Therefore, block3's missing must include 1 here. Therefore, row5, column1 is 1. Which implies that block3's missing 1 is filled here, so row3, column0 must be 9. Because block3's missing are 1 and 9, and 1 is placed in row5, column1. Therefore, row3, column0 is 9. \n\nSo row3 becomes [9,4,5,0,0,0,7,1,8]. Now missing in row3 are 2,3,6. \n\nNow looking at row3's columns3-5. Let's check column3 (row3, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: row0:5, row1:6, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:9, row6:4, row7:3, row8:1. Existing are 5,6,8,9,4,3,1. Missing are 2,7. But row3's missing are 2,3,6. The intersection is 2. Therefore, row3, column3 must be 2. Let me check the block. Row3, column3 is in block4 (rows3-5, columns3-5). Let's check existing numbers in block4. Block4 includes rows3-5, columns3-5. Original row3: columns3-5 are 0, 0, 0. Row4: columns3-5 are 0, 0, 8 (original row4 is [2,3,6, 0, 0, 8, ...]). Wait, original row4 is [2,3,6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 5]. So columns3-5 are 0, 0, 8. Row5: columns3-5 are 9, 0, 5. Existing numbers in block4 are 8,9,5. So missing are 1,2,3,4,6,7. But row3, column3 is to be filled with 2. Let me check if that's allowed. Yes, since block4 doesn't have 2 yet. \n\nSo row3, column3 is 2. Now row3 becomes [9,4,5,2,0,0,7,1,8]. Missing in row3 are 3 and 6. \n\nLooking at column4 (row3, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: row0:2, row1:7, row2:9, row3:0, row4:0, row5:0, row6:5, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 2,7,9,5. Missing are 1,3,4,6,8. Row3's missing are 3 and 6. So possible are 3 and 6. Also check block4. Block4's existing numbers include 2 (now added), 8 (from row4), 9 (from row5), and others. Let me recheck. Block4 (rows3-5, columns3-5) now has row3's column3 as 2, row4's column5 as 8, row5's column3 as 9, and row5's column5 as 5. So existing numbers are 2,8,9,5. Missing are 1,3,4,6,7. Therefore, row3's column4 can be 3 or 6. Let's check if there's any other constraints. \n\nLooking at column4 for row3. Let's see if there's a cell in the same column that can help. For example, row4, column4 is 0. Let's check if we can find something else. \n\nAlternatively, check row3's column5. Let's see. For row3, columns4 and 5 are both 0. Let's check the block. Since row3's missing are 3 and 6, and columns4 and 5 need to be filled. \n\nLet's look at row4. Row4 is [2,3,6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers in row4 are 1,7,9. Let me check column4 for row4. Column4's existing numbers include 2,7,9,5 (from earlier). Wait, row4's column4 is 0. Let me think differently. Maybe look at block4. In block4, row3's columns4 and 5 are 0 and 0. Let's see if there's any other numbers in the block. \n\nBlock4 has row3: columns3=2, columns4=?, columns5=?. Row4: columns3=?, columns4=?, columns5=8. Row5: columns3=9, columns4=?, columns5=5. \n\nSo existing numbers in block4 are 2,8,9,5. Missing are 1,3,4,6,7. \n\nNow, row3's missing in row are 3 and 6. Let's see if there's a way to determine which goes where. \n\nLooking at column4 for row3. If we put 3 in column4, then column5 would be 6. Let's check column4. Column4's existing numbers include 2,7,9,5. If we put 3 in row3, column4, then column4 would have 3 added. Is there any conflict? No. Similarly for column5. Let me check column5. Column5's existing numbers: row0:3, row1:1, row2:4, row3:0, row4:8, row5:5, row6:2, row7:7, row8:0. Existing are 3,1,4,8,5,2,7. Missing are 6,9. So for row3, column5 (which is 0), possible numbers are 6 or 9. But row3's missing are 3 and 6. So only 6 is possible. Therefore, row3, column5 must be 6. Because column5's missing includes 6. Therefore, row3, column5 is 6. Then, row3's missing in row is 3, which must be in column4. \n\nSo row3 becomes [9,4,5,2,3,6,7,1,8]. Now row3 is complete. \n\nNow check row4: [2,3,6, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,7,9. Let's look at columns. \n\nLooking at column3 (row4, column3 is 0). Column3's existing numbers: 5 (row0), 6 (row1), 8 (row2), 2 (row3), ?, row5:9, row6:4, row7:3, row8:1. Existing are 5,6,8,2,9,4,3,1. Missing is 7. Therefore, row4, column3 must be 7. Because column3's missing is 7. Let's check the block. Block4 (rows3-5, columns3-5). Adding 7 here is allowed. \n\nSo row4, column3 is 7. Now row4 becomes [2,3,6,7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1 and 9 in columns4 and 6. \n\nLooking at column4 (row4, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: row0:2, row1:7, row2:9, row3:3, row4:0, row5:0, row6:5, row7:0, row8:0. Existing are 2,7,9,3,5. Missing are 1,4,6,8. But row4's missing are 1 and 9. Wait, row4's current missing are 1 and 9? Wait, original row4 after filling column3 is [2,3,6,7, 0, 8, 0, 4, 5]. Existing numbers are 2,3,6,7,8,4,5. Missing are 1,9. Therefore, for row4, column4 must be 1 or 9. Column4's missing are 1,4,6,8. So only 1 is possible. Therefore, row4, column4 is 1. Then, row4, column6 must be 9. \n\nLet me check column4: adding 1 is allowed. And block4: adding 1 in column4 (row4, column4) is allowed. \n\nSo row4 becomes [2,3,6,7,1,8, 0, 4, 5]. Now missing is 9 in column6. \n\nColumn6 for row4 is 0. Column6's existing numbers: row0:6, row1:8, row2:5, row3:7, row4:0, row5:0, row6:3, row7:0, row8:4. Existing are 6,8,5,7,3,4. Missing are 1,2,9. Row4's missing is 9. So row4, column6 must be 9. Let's check block. Block for row4, column6 is block5 (rows3-5, columns6-8). Existing numbers in block5: row3:7,1,8; row4: 0,4,5; row5: 0,0,6. Existing are 7,1,8,4,5,6. Missing are 2,3,9. Adding 9 here is allowed. \n\nSo row4 becomes [2,3,6,7,1,8,9,4,5]. \n\nNow row4 is filled. \n\nNow row5: [7, 1, 8, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 6]. Missing numbers in row5: existing are 7,1,8,9,5,6. Missing are 2,3,4. \n\nLooking at column4 (row5, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers include 2,7,9,3,1,5. Missing are 4,6,8. Wait, row5's missing are 2,3,4. So for row5, column4, possible numbers are 2,3,4. But column4's missing are 4,6,8. Only 4 is common. Therefore, row5, column4 must be 4. \n\nSo row5 becomes [7,1,8,9,4,5, 0, 0, 6]. Now missing in row5 are 2 and 3. \n\nLooking at columns6 and 7. \n\nColumn6 (row5, column6 is 0). Column6's existing numbers include 6,8,5,7,9,3,4. Missing are 1,2. But row5's missing are 2 and 3. So possible numbers are 2. Because column6's missing is 1 and 2. Therefore, row5, column6 must be 2. \n\nThen, row5, column7 must be 3. Let's check column7. Column7's existing numbers: row0:7, row1:9, row2:2, row3:1, row4:4, row5:0, row6:0, row7:8, row8:0. Existing are 7,9,2,1,4,8. Missing are 3,5,6. Row5's missing is 3. So row5, column7 is 3. \n\nSo row5 becomes [7,1,8,9,4,5,2,3,6]. \n\nNow row5 is filled. \n\nMoving to row6: [0, 8, 0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 7]. Missing numbers in row6: existing are 8,4,5,2,3,7. Missing are 1,6,9. \n\nLooking at column0 (row6, column0 is 0). Column0's existing numbers: 8,5,6,9,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3. But row6's missing are 1,6,9. Intersection is 1. Therefore, row6, column0 must be 1. Let's check block. Row6 is in block6 (rows6-8, columns0-2). Existing numbers in block6: row6: [0,8,0], row7: [4,5,0], row8: [0,6,7]. Existing numbers are 8,4,5,6,7. Missing are 1,2,3,9. So adding 1 here is allowed. \n\nSo row6 becomes [1,8,0,4,5,2,3,0,7]. Now missing in row6 are 6 and 9. \n\nLooking at column2 (row6, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 4,3,1,5,6,8,7. Missing are 2,9. Row6's missing are 6 and 9. So possible is 9. Therefore, row6, column2 must be 9. \n\nSo row6 becomes [1,8,9,4,5,2,3,0,7]. Now missing in row6 is 6 in column7. \n\nColumn7 for row6 is 0. Column7's existing numbers: 7,9,2,1,4,3,8. Missing are 5,6. Row6's missing is 6. So row6, column7 is 6. \n\nSo row6 becomes [1,8,9,4,5,2,3,6,7]. \n\nNow row6 is filled. \n\nRow7: [4,5,0,3,0,7,0,8,9]. Missing numbers in row7: existing are 4,5,3,7,8,9. Missing are 1,2,6. \n\nLooking at column2 (row7, column2 is 0). Column2's existing numbers: 4,3,1,5,6,8,9,7. Missing are 2. Therefore, row7, column2 must be 2. \n\nSo row7 becomes [4,5,2,3,0,7,0,8,9]. Now missing in row7 are 1 and 6. \n\nLooking at column4 (row7, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: 2,7,9,3,1,4,5. Missing are 6,8. But row7's missing are 1 and 6. So possible is 6. Therefore, row7, column4 is 6. \n\nThen, column6 (row7, column6 is 0) must be 1. Because row7's missing is 1. \n\nSo row7 becomes [4,5,2,3,6,7,1,8,9]. \n\nNow row7 is filled. \n\nFinally, row8: [0,6,7,1,0,0,4,0,2]. Missing numbers in row8: existing are 6,7,1,4,2. Missing are 3,5,8,9. \n\nLooking at column0 (row8, column0 is 0). Column0's existing numbers: 8,5,6,9,2,7,1,4. Missing are 3. Therefore, row8, column0 must be 3. \n\nSo row8 becomes [3,6,7,1,0,0,4,0,2]. Now missing in row8 are 5,8,9. \n\nLooking at column4 and 5 and 7. \n\nLet's check column4 (row8, column4 is 0). Column4's existing numbers: 2,7,9,3,1,4,5,6. Missing is 8. Therefore, row8, column4 must be 8. \n\nSo row8 becomes [3,6,7,1,8,0,4,0,2]. Now missing in row8 are 5 and 9. \n\nLooking at column5 (row8, column5 is 0). Column5's existing numbers: 3,1,4,6,8,5,2,7. Missing are 9. Therefore, row8, column5 is 9. \n\nThen, column7 (row8, column7 is 0) must be 5. \n\nSo row8 becomes [3,6,7,1,8,9,4,5,2]. \n\nNow all rows are filled. Let's verify each row, column, and block. \n\nFor example, row0: [8,9,4,5,2,3,6,7,1] – all numbers 1-9, no duplicates. \n\nColumn0: 8,5,6,9,2,7,1,4,3 – all numbers 1-9. \n\nBlock0 (rows0-2, columns0-2): 8,9,4; 5,2,3; 6,7,1 – all numbers. \n\nEverything seems correct. So the final answer is as filled.\n ;Answer: [[8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1], [5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 4], [6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3], [9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8], [2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5], [7, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6], [1, 8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7], [4, 5, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9], [3, 6, 7, 1, 8, 9, 4, 5, 2]]"

      "Okay, let's try to solve this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out which numbers are missing in each row, column, and 3x3 block. Let me start by writing down the current board to visualize it better.\n\nThe board is:\n\nRow 0: [3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6]\nRow 2: [0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 1]\nRow 3: [0, 6, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4]\nRow 4: [7, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [2, 0, 0, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 3]\nRow 6: [6, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5]\nRow 7: [0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 3, 0]\nRow 8: [9, 0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 0, 8, 7]\n\nI need to fill in the zeros with numbers from 1-9 following Sudoku rules. Let me start by checking rows, columns, and blocks for possible numbers.\n\nStarting with Row 0: [3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9]. The missing numbers are 1, 7. Let's check the third column (index 2) and the eighth column (index 7). \n\nLooking at column 2: existing numbers in column 2 are 0 (Row 0), 0 (Row1), 6 (Row2), 8 (Row3), 3 (Row4), 0 (Row5), 7 (Row6), 5 (Row7), 0 (Row8). Wait, need to check all existing numbers in column 2. Let me list them:\n\nRow0: 0\nRow1: 0\nRow2: 6\nRow3: 8\nRow4: 3\nRow5: 0\nRow6: 7\nRow7:5\nRow8:0\nSo existing numbers in column 2 are 3,5,6,7,8. Missing are 1,2,4,9? Wait, no. Wait, column 2's existing numbers are 6,8,3,7,5. So missing numbers are 1,2,4,9? Wait, the column can't have duplicates. Let me recheck:\n\nRow0 column2 is 0, so existing numbers are:\n\nRow2:6, Row3:8, Row4:3, Row6:7, Row7:5. So in column2, existing numbers are 3,5,6,7,8. So missing numbers are 1,2,4,9. But in Row0, the existing numbers are 3,2,4,5,6,8,9. So for Row0's missing numbers (positions 2 and 7), which are 1 and 7. Wait, the row has 3,2,4,5,6,8,9. So missing are 1,7. So for position (0,2) and (0,7). \n\nBut column2 (position (0,2)) can't be 2 because column2 already has 5,6, etc. Wait, the row already has 2. So in Row0, the missing numbers are 1 and 7. Let's check for each position. For position (0,2): column2's existing numbers are 3,5,6,7,8. So possible numbers are 1,2,4,9. But row0 already has 2 and 4. So possible numbers for (0,2) are 1 and 9. But row0 needs 1 and 7. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-express:\n\nRow0: [3, 2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9]. The existing numbers in this row are 3,2,4,5,6,8,9. Missing are 1 and 7. So the two zeros in this row must be 1 and 7. Now, let's look at column2 (third column). For position (0,2), column2's existing numbers are:\n\nLooking at column 2 (index 2):\n\nRow0: 0\nRow1: 0\nRow2: 6\nRow3: 8\nRow4: 3\nRow5: 0\nRow6:7\nRow7:5\nRow8:0\nSo existing numbers in column2 are 3,5,6,7,8. So possible numbers for column2 are 1,2,4,9. But in row0, the missing numbers are 1 and 7. But column2 can't have 7 here because in column2, row6 already has 7. So the possible number for (0,2) is 1 or 9. But row0 needs 1 and 7. So if (0,2) is 1, then (0,7) must be 7. Let's check if that's possible.\n\nCheck column7 for position (0,7). Column7 (index7) has existing numbers:\n\nRow0: 0\nRow1:5\nRow2:0\nRow3:1\nRow4:0\nRow5:9\nRow6:4\nRow7:3\nRow8:8\nSo existing numbers in column7 are 1,3,4,5,8,9. Missing are 2,6,7. Wait, row0's position (0,7) is supposed to be 7. Let's check if 7 is allowed in column7. Column7 currently has no 7. So yes. So if (0,2) is 1, then (0,7) is 7. Let's tentatively put 1 in (0,2) and 7 in (0,7). Let me check the block as well. \n\nRow0 is in the top-left block (rows 0-2, columns 0-2). Let's check that block. The block has:\n\nRow0: 3,2,1 (if we put 1 here)\nRow1: ?,7,? \nRow2: ?, ?,6\nExisting numbers in the block would be 3,2,1,7,6. So 1 is okay here. So that's acceptable. \n\nSo Row0 becomes [3,2,1,4,5,6,8,7,9]. Let me note that down. Now, moving on.\n\nNext, let's look for cells that have only one possible number. Let's check Row1: [0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 5, 6]. Missing numbers in the row are 3,4,8,9. Let's look for cells where only one number is possible.\n\nLooking at position (1,0): column0. Column0 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:7\nRow5:2\nRow6:6\nRow7:0\nRow8:9\nSo existing numbers in column0 are 3,7,2,6,9. Missing are 1,4,5,8. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So the intersection here is 4 and 8. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 4 or 8. Let's check the block. Row1 is in the top-middle block (rows 0-2, columns 3-5? No, wait, blocks are 3x3. Let me clarify:\n\nThe blocks are divided as follows:\n\nBlocks are 0-2 rows and 0-2 columns for the first block, then 0-2 rows and 3-5 columns for the second, etc. Similarly for rows 3-5 and 6-8.\n\nRow1 is in rows 0-2, columns 0-2 for the first block? Wait, columns 0-2 for the first block. So Row1 is in the first block (columns 0-2, rows 0-2). So position (1,0) is in block (0,0). Let's check existing numbers in this block. Current block includes:\n\nRow0: 3,2,1\nRow1: ?,7,?\nRow2: ?, ?,6\nExisting numbers: 3,2,1,7,6. Missing are 4,5,8,9. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So possible for (1,0) is 4,8, or 9? Wait, the block's missing numbers are 4,5,8,9. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 4,8,9. But column0's existing numbers are 3,7,2,6,9. So if column0 already has 9, then (1,0) can't be 9. So possible numbers are 4 and 8. \n\nHmm. Let's check other positions in Row1. Maybe another cell is easier. Let's look at position (1,3) which is column3. Column3 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:4\nRow1:0\nRow2:0\nRow3:7\nRow4:2\nRow5:5\nRow6:0\nRow7:6\nRow8:1\nSo existing numbers in column3 are 1,2,4,5,6,7. Missing are 3,8,9. Row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So possible for (1,3) is 3,8,9. Also, check the block. Position (1,3) is in block (0,1) (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Let's check existing numbers in that block. \n\nColumns 3-5 for rows 0-2:\n\nRow0:4,5,6\nRow1:0,2,1\nRow2:0,7,0\nExisting numbers: 4,5,6,2,1,7. Missing are 3,8,9. So possible for (1,3) is 3,8,9. \n\nSo possible numbers for (1,3) are 3,8,9. Let's see if there's another cell in the row with fewer possibilities. Let's check position (1,2) (column2). In column2, existing numbers are 1 (from row0), 0 (row1), 6 (row2), 8 (row3), etc. Wait, column2's existing numbers are 1,6,8,3,7,5. So missing are 2,4,9. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So for (1,2), possible numbers are 4,9? Because column2 can't have 3 or 8 (since column2 has existing 3 in row4? Wait, column2's existing numbers include 3 (row4). Wait, column2's existing numbers are 1 (row0), 0 (row1), 6 (row2), 8 (row3), 3 (row4), 0 (row5), 7 (row6), 5 (row7), 0 (row8). So existing numbers in column2 are 1,3,5,6,7,8. So missing are 2,4,9. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So for (1,2), possible numbers are 4 and 9 (since 3 and 8 are not in column2's missing numbers). Wait, because row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9, but column2 can't have 3 or 8 (since they are already present in column2?), no. Wait, column2 already has 3 (row4) and 8 (row3). So for (1,2), the possible numbers are those that are in row1's missing and column2's missing. Row1's missing: 3,4,8,9. Column2's missing: 2,4,9. So intersection is 4,9. So (1,2) can be 4 or 9. \n\nHmm. Not helpful yet. Let me check another cell. Let's look at position (1,6) (column6). Column6 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:8\nRow1:0\nRow2:3\nRow3:0\nRow4:5\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:9\nRow8:0\nExisting numbers in column6: 3,5,8,9. Missing are 1,2,4,6,7. But row1's missing numbers are 3,4,8,9. So possible numbers for (1,6) are 4. Because row1's missing numbers include 4, and column6's missing includes 4. So maybe (1,6) is 4? Let me check. \n\nIf (1,6) is 4, then check the block (0,2) which is columns 6-8, rows 0-2. Let's see existing numbers in that block:\n\nRow0:8,7,9\nRow1:0,5,6\nRow2:3,0,1\nExisting numbers: 8,7,9,5,6,3,1. Missing are 2,4. So if (1,6) is 4, then that's allowed because 4 is missing. Yes. So that would work. So (1,6) is 4. \n\nSo updating Row1's position (1,6) to 4. Now Row1 becomes [0,7,0,0,2,1,4,5,6]. Now, the missing numbers in Row1 are 3,8,9 (since we filled in 4). \n\nLet me check if that's correct. Original missing numbers were 3,4,8,9. Now filled 4, so remaining are 3,8,9. \n\nNow, let's look at column6 for position (1,6) which is 4. That's okay. Now, let's check other cells. \n\nLooking at position (1,0) again. Possible numbers are 4 and 8, but 4 is already in row1 now. So no, since we filled in 4 in (1,6), row1 can't have another 4. So for (1,0), possible numbers are 3,8,9? Wait, row1's missing numbers are 3,8,9. Column0's existing numbers are 3,7,2,6,9. So if (1,0) is in column0, which can't have 3 or 9 (already present?), let's check. \n\nColumn0 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1: ?\nRow2: ?\nRow3: ?\nRow4:7\nRow5:2\nRow6:6\nRow7: ?\nRow8:9\n\nSo existing numbers in column0 are 3,7,2,6,9. So if (1,0) is 3, but column0 already has 3, so that's invalid. Therefore, (1,0) can't be 3. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 8 or 9. \n\nNow, let's check the block for (1,0). It's in block (0,0). Existing numbers in that block are 3,2,1 (from row0), 7 (row1, column1), 6 (row2, column2). Missing are 4,5,8,9. But row1's missing are 3,8,9. Wait, but in the block, missing are 4,5,8,9. So possible numbers for (1,0) are 8,9. \n\nLet me check if there's another cell in the block that can help. For example, position (1,2) (row1, column2) is 0. Let's see if we can find possibilities there. \n\nEarlier, we determined that (1,2) can be 4 or 9. But row1's missing numbers are now 3,8,9. Wait, no, after filling in 4 in (1,6), row1's missing numbers are 3,8,9. So (1,2) can only be 9 (since 4 is already filled). Because earlier, the intersection of row1's missing (3,8,9) and column2's missing (2,4,9) is 9. So (1,2) must be 9. \n\nYes! Because column2's missing numbers are 2,4,9. But row1's missing numbers are 3,8,9. The only common is 9. So (1,2) must be 9. \n\nSo updating (1,2) to 9. Now Row1 becomes [0,7,9,0,2,1,4,5,6]. Now, row1's missing numbers are 3 and 8. \n\nNow, looking at (1,0) and (1,3). \n\nFor (1,0): possible numbers are 8 and 9. But row1 now has 9 in column2, so (1,0) can't be 9. Therefore, (1,0) must be 8. \n\nSo (1,0) is 8. Now Row1 becomes [8,7,9,0,2,1,4,5,6]. Now, the remaining missing number in row1 is 3, which must be in (1,3). \n\nSo (1,3) is 3. \n\nNow Row1 is [8,7,9,3,2,1,4,5,6]. \n\nGreat! Now Row1 is complete. Let's update the board.\n\nNow let's move to Row2: [0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 0, 3, 0, 1]. Missing numbers are 2,4,5,8,9. Let's check possible cells. \n\nLooking at column0 for position (2,0). Column0 has existing numbers: 3,8 (row1), 7,2,6,9. So existing are 2,3,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1,4,5. But row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5,8,9. So intersection is 4,5. \n\nCheck block (0,0) for (2,0). The block has 3,2,1,8,7,9,6 (from row2, column2). Missing are 4,5. So possible numbers are 4 and 5. \n\nLet me check other positions in Row2. For example, position (2,3) (column3). Column3 has existing numbers: 4 (row0), 3 (row1), 0 (row2), 7 (row3), 2 (row4), 5 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 1 (row8). So existing in column3 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Missing are 8,9. \n\nRow2's missing numbers are 2,4,5,8,9. So for (2,3), possible numbers are 8,9. \n\nAlso, check the block for (2,3). Position (2,3) is in block (0,1) (rows 0-2, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in this block: \n\nRow0:4,5,6\nRow1:3,2,1\nRow2: ?,7, ?\nExisting numbers: 4,5,6,3,2,1,7. Missing are 8,9. So yes, (2,3) must be 8 or 9. \n\nLet me see if there are other cells in Row2 that can be filled. \n\nLooking at position (2,5) (column5). Column5 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:6\nRow1:1\nRow2:0\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:8\nRow6:0\nRow7:7\nRow8:5\nExisting numbers: 1,5,6,7,8. Missing are 2,3,4,9. Row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5,8,9. So for (2,5), possible numbers are 2,4,9. \n\nAlso, check block (0,1) for (2,5). The block (columns 3-5, rows 0-2) has existing numbers as before. Missing are 8,9. Wait, but column5 is part of this block. Wait, the block includes columns 3-5. So for (2,5), which is in column5, the block's missing numbers are 8 and 9. So (2,5) must be 8 or 9. But row2's missing numbers for (2,5) are 2,4,9. Therefore, the only possible is 9. So (2,5) is 9. \n\nUpdating Row2's position (2,5) to 9. Now Row2 becomes [0, 0, 6, 0, 7, 9, 3, 0, 1]. Now, row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5,8. \n\nNow, column3 for (2,3) can be 8 or 9, but since (2,5) is 9, and column3's missing are 8 and 9, but (2,3) can't be 9 because row2 already has 9 in column5. So (2,3) must be 8. \n\nSo (2,3) is 8. Now Row2 becomes [0, 0, 6, 8, 7, 9, 3, 0, 1]. Now, row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5. \n\nNow, looking at position (2,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers:\n\nRow0:2\nRow1:7\nRow2:0\nRow3:6\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:4\nRow8:0\nExisting numbers: 2,4,6,7. Missing are 1,3,5,8,9. Row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5. So intersection is 5. Wait, row2's missing are 2,4,5. Column1's missing includes 5. So possible for (2,1) is 5? Let me check. \n\nBut wait, row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5. So if (2,1) is 5, then check the block. Block (0,0) for (2,1) (row2, column1). The block has existing numbers: 3,2,1 (row0), 8,7,9 (row1), 6 (row2, column2). Missing are 4,5. So possible numbers for (2,1) are 4 or 5. \n\nBut column1's existing numbers are 2,7,6,4 (from row7). So if (2,1) is 5, that's allowed. Let me check if there's another cell in the row that can be filled. \n\nLooking at position (2,7) (column7). Column7's existing numbers are 7 (row0),5 (row1), 0 (row2),1 (row3), 0 (row4),9 (row5),4 (row6),3 (row7),8 (row8). Existing are 1,3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 2,6. Row2's missing numbers are 2,4,5. So possible for (2,7) is 2. Because column7's missing is 2 and 6. But row2's missing includes 2. So (2,7) is 2. \n\nYes! So updating (2,7) to 2. Now Row2 becomes [0, 0, 6, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1]. Now, row2's missing numbers are 4 and 5. \n\nNow, looking at positions (2,0) and (2,1). \n\nFor (2,0): column0 has existing numbers 3,8,7,2,6,9. Missing are 1,4,5. Row2's missing are 4,5. So possible numbers are 4 and 5. \n\nFor (2,1): column1 has existing numbers 2,7,6,4. Missing are 1,3,5,8,9. Row2's missing are 4,5. So possible for (2,1) is 5 (since 4 is not in column1's missing). \n\nSo (2,1) must be 5. Then (2,0) would be 4. \n\nCheck block (0,0) for (2,1)=5. The block's missing are 4 and 5. Yes, adding 5 is okay. \n\nSo updating (2,1) to 5 and (2,0) to 4. Now Row2 is [4,5,6,8,7,9,3,2,1]. \n\nGreat! Now Row2 is complete. Let's move on.\n\nNow, Row3: [0, 6, 8, 7, 0, 0, 0, 1, 4]. Missing numbers are 2,3,5,9. Let's check each cell.\n\nLooking at position (3,0) (column0). Column0's existing numbers are 3,8,4,7,2,6,9. Missing are 1,5. Wait, row3's missing numbers are 2,3,5,9. So intersection is 5. So (3,0) can be 5? Let me check. \n\nWait, column0's existing numbers are:\n\nRow0:3\nRow1:8\nRow2:4\nRow3:0\nRow4:7\nRow5:2\nRow6:6\nRow7:?\nRow8:9\nSo existing in column0: 2,3,4,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1,5. So for (3,0), possible numbers are 1 or 5. But row3's missing are 2,3,5,9. So only possible is 5. \n\nTherefore, (3,0) is 5. Now Row3 becomes [5,6,8,7,0,0,0,1,4]. Missing numbers now are 2,3,9. \n\nNow, looking at position (3,4) (column4). Column4 has existing numbers:\n\nRow0:5\nRow1:2\nRow2:7\nRow3:0\nRow4:1\nRow5:6\nRow6:0\nRow7:8\nRow8:4\nExisting numbers: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8. Missing are 3,9. \n\nRow3's missing numbers are 2,3,9. So for (3,4), possible numbers are 3,9. \n\nCheck the block for (3,4). Position (3,4) is in block (1,1) (rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Let's check existing numbers in this block:\n\nColumns 3-5 for rows 3-5:\n\nRow3:7, 0, 0\nRow4:2,1,0\nRow5:5,6,8\nExisting numbers: 1,2,5,6,7,8. Missing are 3,4,9. \n\nSo for (3,4), possible numbers are 3,9. \n\nLet me check other cells in Row3. \n\nLooking at position (3,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers are:\n\nRow0:6\nRow1:1\nRow2:9\nRow3:0\nRow4:0\nRow5:8\nRow6:0\nRow7:7\nRow8:5\nExisting: 1,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,3,4. \n\nRow3's missing are 2,3,9. So possible for (3,5) is 3. \n\nBecause column5's missing includes 3. So (3,5) is 3. \n\nNow Row3 becomes [5,6,8,7,0,3,0,1,4]. Now, missing numbers are 2,9. \n\nNow, position (3,4) can be 3 or 9. But since we filled in 3 in (3,5), (3,4) can't be 3. So (3,4) must be 9. \n\nUpdating (3,4) to 9. Now Row3 becomes [5,6,8,7,9,3,0,1,4]. Missing numbers now are 2. \n\nSo the remaining cell is (3,6) (column6). Column6's existing numbers are:\n\nRow0:8\nRow1:4\nRow2:3\nRow3:0\nRow4:5\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:9\nRow8:0\nExisting: 3,4,5,8,9. Missing are 1,2,6,7. \n\nRow3's missing is 2. So (3,6) must be 2. \n\nNow Row3 is [5,6,8,7,9,3,2,1,4]. \n\nGreat! Now Row3 is complete. \n\nMoving to Row4: [7, 0, 3, 2, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0]. Missing numbers are 4,6,8,9. Let's check cells.\n\nLooking at position (4,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers are:\n\nRow0:2\nRow1:7\nRow2:5\nRow3:6\nRow4:0\nRow5:0\nRow6:0\nRow7:4\nRow8:0\nExisting: 2,4,5,6,7. Missing are 1,3,8,9. \n\nRow4's missing numbers are 4,6,8,9. So intersection is 8,9. \n\nCheck block (1,0) for (4,1). Block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in this block:\n\nRow3:5,6,8\nRow4:7, ?,3\nRow5:2, ?, ?\nExisting numbers: 2,3,5,6,7,8. Missing are 1,4,9. \n\nSo possible numbers for (4,1) are 8,9 but block's missing are 1,4,9. So only possible is 9. Therefore, (4,1) is 9. \n\nUpdating Row4 to [7,9,3,2,1,0,5,0,0]. Now missing numbers are 4,6,8. \n\nNow, looking at position (4,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers are 6,1,9,3,0 (Row4), etc. Let me check column5 again:\n\nExisting numbers in column5: 6 (row0),1 (row1),9 (row2),3 (row3),0 (row4),8 (row5),0 (row6),7 (row7),5 (row8). So existing are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4. \n\nRow4's missing numbers are 4,6,8. So possible for (4,5) is 4. \n\nYes! Because column5 is missing 2 and 4. Row4's missing includes 4. So (4,5) is 4. \n\nNow Row4 becomes [7,9,3,2,1,4,5,0,0]. Missing numbers now are 6 and 8. \n\nLooking at position (4,7) and (4,8). \n\nCheck column7 for (4,7). Column7's existing numbers are 7 (row0),5 (row1),2 (row2),1 (row3),0 (row4),9 (row5),4 (row6),3 (row7),8 (row8). Existing: 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 6. \n\nSo (4,7) must be 6. Then (4,8) must be 8. \n\nSo updating Row4 to [7,9,3,2,1,4,5,6,8]. \n\nNow Row4 is complete. \n\nNext, Row5: [2, 0, 0, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 3]. Missing numbers are 1,4,7. \n\nLooking at position (5,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers are 2,7,5,6,9, etc. Existing numbers in column1: 2 (row0),7 (row1),5 (row2),6 (row3),9 (row4),0 (row5),0 (row6),4 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 2,4,5,6,7,9. Missing are 1,3,8. \n\nRow5's missing are 1,4,7. So intersection is 1,7. \n\nCheck block (1,0) for (5,1). Block rows3-5, columns0-2. Existing numbers:\n\nRow3:5,6,8\nRow4:7,9,3\nRow5:2, ?, ?\nExisting numbers: 2,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 1,4. \n\nSo possible for (5,1) are 1 and 4. But row5's missing are 1,4,7. So possible numbers are 1 and 4. \n\nLet me check other cells in Row5. \n\nLooking at position (5,2) (column2). Column2's existing numbers: 1 (row0),9 (row1),6 (row2),8 (row3),3 (row4),0 (row5),7 (row6),5 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 1,3,5,6,7,8,9. Missing are 2,4. \n\nRow5's missing are 1,4,7. So for (5,2), possible is 4. \n\nYes, because column2's missing are 2,4. Row5's missing includes 4. So (5,2) is 4. \n\nNow Row5 becomes [2, 0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 0, 9, 3]. Now missing numbers are 1 and 7. \n\nNow, looking at position (5,1): column1's missing are 1,3,8. But row5's missing are 1,7. So possible for (5,1) is 1. \n\nBecause 1 is in both. So (5,1) is 1. Now Row5 becomes [2,1,4,5,6,8,0,9,3]. Missing number is 7 in position (5,6). \n\nSo (5,6) is 7. Now Row5 is [2,1,4,5,6,8,7,9,3]. \n\nGreat! Now Row5 is complete. \n\nMoving to Row6: [6, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,2,3,8,9. \n\nLet me check possible cells. \n\nLooking at position (6,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers are 2,7,5,6,9,1 (row5), etc. Existing: 1,2,4,5,6,7,9. Missing are 3,8. \n\nRow6's missing numbers are 1,2,3,8,9. So possible for (6,1) is 3 or 8. \n\nCheck block (2,0) for (6,1). Block rows6-8, columns0-2. Existing numbers:\n\nRow6:6, ?,7\nRow7: ?,4,5\nRow8:9, ?, ?\nExisting numbers: 4,5,6,7,9. Missing are 1,2,3,8. \n\nSo possible numbers for (6,1) are 3,8. \n\nLet me check other cells in Row6. \n\nLooking at position (6,3) (column3). Column3's existing numbers are 4,3,8,7,2,5,0 (row6),6,1. Existing: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. Missing is 9. \n\nSo (6,3) must be 9. \n\nUpdating Row6 to [6, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5]. Now, missing numbers are 1,2,3,8. \n\nNow, position (6,4) (column4). Column4's existing numbers: 5 (row0), 2 (row1),7 (row2),9 (row3),1 (row4),6 (row5),0 (row6),8 (row7),4 (row8). Existing: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing is 3. \n\nSo (6,4) must be 3. \n\nNow Row6 becomes [6, 0, 7, 9, 3, 0, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,2,8. \n\nLooking at position (6,5) (column5). Column5's existing numbers are 6,1,9,3,4,8,0 (row6),7,5. Existing: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing is 2. \n\nSo (6,5) must be 2. \n\nNow Row6 becomes [6, 0, 7, 9, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,8. \n\nNow, looking at position (6,6) (column6). Column6's existing numbers are 8,4,3,2,5,7,9, etc. Existing: 2,3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 1,6. \n\nBut row6's missing are 1,8. So possible for (6,6) is 1. Because column6 is missing 1 and 6. But row6 has 8 missing. Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, row6's missing numbers are 1 and 8. \n\nWait, Row6 is [6, 0, 7, 9, 3, 2, 0, 4, 5]. Missing numbers are 1,8 (since existing are 6,7,9,3,2,4,5). \n\nSo position (6,6) can be 1 or 8. \n\nCheck column6: existing numbers are 8 (row0),4 (row1),3 (row2),2 (row3),5 (row4),7 (row5),0 (row6),9 (row7),0 (row8). Existing are 2,3,4,5,7,8,9. Missing are 1,6. \n\nSo possible for (6,6) is 1. \n\nTherefore, (6,6) is 1. Then the remaining missing number is 8 in position (6,1). \n\nSo (6,1) is 8. Now Row6 becomes [6,8,7,9,3,2,1,4,5]. \n\nNow check if that's valid. Column1 now has 8 in row6, which is allowed since column1's existing numbers were missing 3 and 8. Now it's filled. \n\nNow Row6 is complete. \n\nNext, Row7: [0, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 3, 0]. Missing numbers are 1,2. \n\nLooking at position (7,0) (column0). Column0's existing numbers are 3,8,4,5,7,2,6,9. Missing are 1. \n\nSo (7,0) must be 1. \n\nThen position (7,8) (column8) is missing 2. \n\nSo Row7 becomes [1,4,5,6,8,7,9,3,2]. \n\nNow check column8 for 2. Existing numbers in column8: 9 (row0),6 (row1),1 (row2),4 (row3),8 (row4),3 (row5),5 (row6),2 (row7),7 (row8). Wait, no, let me check again. \n\nOriginal column8:\n\nRow0:9\nRow1:6\nRow2:1\nRow3:4\nRow4:8\nRow5:3\nRow6:5\nRow7:2\nRow8:7\nYes, all numbers 1-9 are present. \n\nNow, Row7 is complete. \n\nFinally, Row8: [9, 0, 0, 1, 4, 5, 0, 8, 7]. Missing numbers are 2,3,6. \n\nLooking at position (8,1) (column1). Column1's existing numbers: 2,7,5,6,9,1,8,4. Missing are 3. \n\nSo (8,1) must be 3. \n\nNow Row8 becomes [9,3,0,1,4,5,0,8,7]. Missing numbers are 2,6. \n\nLooking at position (8,2) (column2). Column2's existing numbers: 1,9,6,8,3,4,7,5,0. Existing are 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Missing is 2. \n\nSo (8,2) must be 2. \n\nNow Row8 becomes [9,3,2,1,4,5,0,8,7]. Missing number is 6 in position (8,6). \n\nSo (8,6) is 6. Now Row8 is [9,3,2,1,4,5,6,8,7]. \n\nCheck column6 for 6.

      "Okay, let's tackle this Sudoku puzzle. First, I need to look at the given board and figure out where the zeros are and what numbers can fit there. Let me start by writing down the current state of the board for clarity.\n\nThe initial board is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 6, 5, 0, 8, 0, 2, 7]\nRow 1: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 9, 8]\nRow 2: [5, 9, 8, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 6]\nRow 3: [0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 5, 9, 8, 1]\nRow 4: [0, 8, 0, 2, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 2, 7, 0]\nRow 6: [0, 1, 2, 7, 0, 0, 6, 5, 9]\nRow 7: [6, 5, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1, 2]\n\nAlright, let me start by looking for cells that have only one possible number based on the existing numbers in their row, column, and 3x3 block.\n\nStarting with Row 0. Let's look at each cell:\n\nRow 0, Column 0: The current cell is 0. Let's check possible numbers. The row has 6,5,8,2,7. So missing numbers are 1,3,4,9. Column 0 has 1,5,3,6. So missing in column are 2,4,7,8,9? Wait, no. Wait, column 0 has existing numbers: row 0 is 0, row1 is 1, row2 is 5, row3 is 0, row4 is 0, row5 is 3, row6 is 0, row7 is 6, row8 is 0. So column 0 has 1,5,3,6. So possible numbers for column 0 are 2,4,7,8,9. But the cell is in row 0, column 0. Also, check the 3x3 block. Row 0-2, columns 0-2. The block includes row0: [0,0,6], row1: [1,0,0], row2: [5,9,8]. So existing numbers in block are 1,5,6,9,8. So possible numbers for this cell are 2,3,4,7. Combining with row and column possibilities. Wait, the row's missing numbers for row 0 are 1,3,4,9. But column 0's possible numbers are 2,4,7,8,9. So the intersection of row's missing and column's possible and block's possible. Let's see:\n\nRow 0's missing numbers: 1,3,4,9.\n\nBut column 0's existing numbers include 1,5,3,6? Wait, column 0's existing numbers are 1 (row1), 5 (row2), 3 (row5), 6 (row7). So possible numbers for column 0 are numbers not in {1,3,5,6} which are 2,4,7,8,9. So the cell (0,0) must be in the intersection of row's missing (1,3,4,9), column's possible (2,4,7,8,9), and block's possible (since the block has 1,5,6,8,9). So the block's possible numbers for this cell are numbers not in the block's existing numbers. The existing numbers in the block (block top-left) are 1,5,6,8,9. So possible numbers are 2,3,4,7. Now, the intersection of row's missing (1,3,4,9), column's possible (2,4,7,8,9), and block's possible (2,3,4,7). So common numbers are 4 and maybe others? Let's see:\n\nRow's missing: 1,3,4,9.\n\nColumn's possible: 2,4,7,8,9.\n\nBlock's possible: 2,3,4,7.\n\nThe intersection is numbers that are in all three. So 4 is in all three. 9 is in row's missing and column's possible, but not in block's possible (since block already has 9 in row2, column 2). So 4 is a possible candidate. Are there others? Let's check 3: is 3 in column's possible? Column 0's possible numbers are 2,4,7,8,9. So 3 is not allowed in column 0. So the only possible number is 4. So cell (0,0) must be 4. Let me check that.\n\nIf I put 4 in (0,0), then check row 0: 4 is not present elsewhere. Column 0: no 4 yet. Block: no 4. So that's valid. So cell (0,0) is 4. Let's update that.\n\nNow row 0 becomes [4, 0, 6, 5, 0, 8, 0, 2, 7].\n\nNext, cell (0,1) is 0. Let's check possible numbers.\n\nRow 0: existing numbers are 4,6,5,8,2,7. Missing are 1,3,9, and the two zeros. Column 1: existing numbers are row0:0, row1:0, row2:9, row3:7, row4:8, row5:0, row6:1, row7:5, row8:0. So column 1 has 9,7,8,1,5. So missing numbers in column 1 are 2,3,4,6, etc. Wait, column 1's existing numbers are 9 (row2),7 (row3),8 (row4),1 (row6),5 (row7). So possible numbers for column 1 are 2,3,4,6. Also, check the block (same as before, block top-left). The block has 4 (now in row0, col0), 0 (row0, col1), 6 (row0, col2), 1 (row1, col0), 0 (row1, col1), 0 (row1, col2), 5 (row2, col0),9 (row2, col1),8 (row2, col2). Existing numbers in the block are 4,6,1,5,9,8. So missing in the block are 2,3,7. So possible numbers for cell (0,1) must be in row's missing (1,3,9), column's possible (2,3,4,6?), wait let me recheck column 1. Column 1's existing numbers are 9 (row2), 7 (row3), 8 (row4), 1 (row6), 5 (row7). So numbers present in column 1 are 1,5,7,8,9. Therefore, possible numbers for column 1 are 2,3,4,6. \n\nRow 0's missing numbers are 1,3,9 (since existing are 4,6,5,8,2,7). So row's missing is 1,3,9. The intersection of column's possible (2,3,4,6) and row's missing (1,3,9) is only 3. Also, the block's missing numbers are 2,3,7. So the intersection of row, column, and block is 3. Therefore, cell (0,1) must be 3. Let's check that. \n\nYes, 3 is not in row 0, column 1, or block. So cell (0,1) is 3. Now row0 becomes [4,3,6,5,0,8,0,2,7].\n\nNow, cell (0,4) is 0. Let's look at this. Row 0's missing numbers are 1,9 (since existing numbers are 4,3,6,5,8,2,7). Column 4: existing numbers are row0:0, row1:0, row2:2, row3:6, row4:7, row5:8, row6:0, row7:1, row8:5. So column 4 has 2,6,7,8,1,5. Missing numbers are 3,4,9. But row 0's missing numbers are 1 and 9. So the intersection is 9. Therefore, cell (0,4) must be 9. Let me check.\n\nYes, because column 4 doesn't have 9 yet, and row 0 doesn't have 9. Also, the block (top-left) has no 9 except in row2, col1. So yes, cell (0,4) is 9. Now row0 becomes [4,3,6,5,9,8,0,2,7].\n\nNext, cell (0,6) is 0. Let's check. Row 0 now has 4,3,6,5,9,8,2,7. Missing is 1. So the only missing number in row 0 is 1. Therefore, cell (0,6) must be 1. Let me check column 6. Column 6's existing numbers are row0:0 (now will be 1), row1:0, row2:4, row3:9, row4:0, row5:2, row6:6, row7:0, row8:8. So 1 is not present in column 6. And block (top-left) doesn't have 1 except row1, col0. So yes, 1 is valid. So cell (0,6) is 1. Now row0 is complete: [4,3,6,5,9,8,1,2,7].\n\nGreat, row0 is filled. Let's move to row1: [1, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 9, 8]. Let's look for cells with only possible numbers.\n\nLooking at row1. Let's check each cell.\n\nRow1, column1 (cell (1,1)): 0. Let's see. Row1 has 1,4,6,9,8. Missing numbers are 2,3,5,7. Column1 has existing numbers: row0:3, row1:0, row2:9, row3:7, row4:8, row5:0, row6:1, row7:5, row8:0. So column1 has 3,9,7,8,1,5. Missing are 2,4,6. Wait, column1's existing numbers are 3,9,7,8,1,5. So possible numbers for column1 are 2,4,6. But row1's missing are 2,3,5,7. The intersection is 2. So cell (1,1) could be 2? Let's check block. The block is top-middle (columns 3-5?), wait no. Let me clarify the blocks. Each block is 3x3. For row1, columns 0-2 are in the top-left block. So cell (1,1) is in the top-left block. The existing numbers in that block are row0:4,3,6; row1:1, 0, 0; row2:5,9,8. Existing numbers are 4,3,6,1,5,9,8. So missing in the block are 2,7. Therefore, cell (1,1) must be in the intersection of row's possible (2,3,5,7), column's possible (2,4,6), and block's possible (2,7). The intersection is 2. So cell (1,1) is 2. Let me check that. Yes. So cell (1,1) is 2. Now row1 becomes [1,2,0,4,0,6,0,9,8].\n\nNow cell (1,2) is 0. Let's check. Row1's missing numbers are 3,5,7 (since existing are 1,2,4,6,9,8). Column2: existing numbers are row0:6, row1:0, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:5, row6:2, row7:0, row8:3. So column2 has 6,8,5,2,3. Missing are 1,4,7,9. But row1's missing are 3,5,7. So intersection is 7? Wait, row1's missing numbers are 3,5,7. Column2's possible numbers are 1,4,7,9. The intersection is 7. Also, check the block (top-left). The block's existing numbers include 4,3,6,1,2,5,9,8. Missing are 7. So cell (1,2) must be 7. Let me confirm. Yes, 7 is not in row1, column2, or block. So cell (1,2) is 7. Now row1 becomes [1,2,7,4,0,6,0,9,8].\n\nNow cell (1,4) is 0. Let's check. Row1's missing numbers are 3,5 (since existing are 1,2,7,4,6,9,8). Column4: existing numbers are row0:9, row1:0, row2:2, row3:6, row4:7, row5:8, row6:0, row7:1, row8:5. So column4 has 9,2,6,7,8,1,5. Missing are 3,4. But row1's missing are 3,5. So intersection is 3. Therefore, cell (1,4) is 3. Check block: top-middle block (columns 3-5). The block includes row0: columns 3-5 (5,9,8), row1: columns 3-5 (4,3,6), row2: columns 3-5 (1,2,0). Existing numbers are 5,9,8,4,3,6,1,2. Missing are 7. Wait, but cell (1,4) is in the top-middle block. Wait, the block is rows 0-2, columns 3-5. So existing numbers in that block: 5,9,8 (row0), 4,3,6 (row1), 1,2, 0 (row2). So missing in the block are 7. But according to row and column, cell (1,4) is 3. Wait, but the block already has 3 in row1, column4? Wait, no. If cell (1,4) is 3, then in the block (top-middle), there's a 3. But the existing numbers in the block are 5,9,8,4,3 (from cell (1,4)), 6, 1, 2. So the missing would be 7. But that's okay. So yes, 3 is valid here. So cell (1,4) is 3. Now row1 becomes [1,2,7,4,3,6,0,9,8].\n\nNow cell (1,6) is 0. Row1's missing numbers are 5 (since existing are 1,2,7,4,3,6,9,8). So missing is 5. Let me check column6. Column6's existing numbers are row0:1, row1:0, row2:4, row3:9, row4:0, row5:2, row6:6, row7:0, row8:8. So missing in column6 are 3,5,7. But row1's missing is 5. So cell (1,6) is 5. Also, check the block. The block for row1, column6 is middle-center block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block are row0:1,2,7; row1:0,9,8; row2:4,0,6. Existing numbers are 1,2,7,9,8,4,6. Missing are 3,5. So cell (1,6) can be 5. So yes. So cell (1,6) is 5. Now row1 becomes [1,2,7,4,3,6,5,9,8]. Row1 is complete.\n\nNow moving to row2: [5,9,8,1,2,0,4,0,6]. Let's look at cell (2,5) which is 0. Row2's missing numbers: existing are 5,9,8,1,2,4,6. Missing are 3,7. Column5: existing numbers are row0:8, row1:6, row2:0, row3:5, row4:4, row5:0, row6:0, row7:2, row8:0. So column5 has 8,6,5,4,2. Missing are 1,3,7,9. But row2's missing are 3,7. Intersection is 3 and 7. Let's check block. Row2 is in the top-middle block (columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block are 1,2,0 (row2's columns 3-5). Wait, row2's columns 3-5 are 1,2,0. Existing numbers in the block (from earlier) are 5,9,8 (row0), 4,3,6 (row1), 1,2,0 (row2). So existing numbers are 5,9,8,4,3,6,1,2. Missing is 7. Therefore, cell (2,5) must be 7. Let me confirm. Yes, because the block needs 7. So cell (2,5) is 7. Now row2 becomes [5,9,8,1,2,7,4,0,6].\n\nNow cell (2,7) is 0. Row2's missing number is 3 (since existing are 5,9,8,1,2,7,4,6). So missing is 3. Column7: existing numbers are row0:2, row1:9, row2:0, row3:8, row4:0, row5:7, row6:5, row7:0, row8:1. So column7 has 2,9,8,7,5,1. Missing are 3,4,6. But row2's missing is 3. So cell (2,7) is 3. Check block (top-right block, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block (rows 0-2, columns 6-8): row0:1,2,7; row1:5,9,8; row2:4,0,6. Existing numbers are 1,2,7,5,9,8,4,6. Missing is 3. So yes, cell (2,7) is 3. Now row2 becomes [5,9,8,1,2,7,4,3,6]. Row2 is complete.\n\nNow row3: [0,7,0,0,6,5,9,8,1]. Let's look for cells. Starting with cell (3,0) which is 0. Let's check possible numbers. Row3's existing numbers: 7,6,5,9,8,1. Missing are 2,3,4. Column0: existing numbers are row0:4, row1:1, row2:5, row3:0, row4:0, row5:3, row6:0, row7:6, row8:0. So column0 has 4,1,5,3,6. Missing are 2,7,8,9. But row3's missing are 2,3,4. Intersection is 2. Also, check the block. Cell (3,0) is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in that block: row3: [0,7,0], row4: [0,8,0], row5: [3,0,5]. Existing numbers are 7,8,3,5. Missing are 1,2,4,6,9. Wait, but row3's missing are 2,3,4. Wait, the row's missing are 2,3,4. But column's possible for column0 is 2,7,8,9. The intersection is 2. So cell (3,0) must be 2. Let me check. Yes, 2 is not in row3, column0, or block. So cell (3,0) is 2. Now row3 becomes [2,7,0,0,6,5,9,8,1].\n\nNow cell (3,2) is 0. Row3's missing numbers now are 3,4 (since existing are 2,7,6,5,9,8,1). Column2: existing numbers are row0:6, row1:7, row2:8, row3:0, row4:0, row5:5, row6:2, row7:0, row8:3. So column2 has 6,7,8,5,2,3. Missing are 1,4,9. But row3's missing are 3,4. Wait, row3's missing numbers after adding 2 are 3 and 4. Column2's missing are 1,4,9. So intersection is 4. So cell (3,2) is 4. Check block (middle-left). Existing numbers in the block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2): row3:2,7,0; row4:0,8,0; row5:3,0,5. Existing numbers are 2,7,8,3,5. Adding 4 to cell (3,2) would be okay. Also, column2's missing includes 4. So yes. So cell (3,2) is 4. Now row3 becomes [2,7,4,0,6,5,9,8,1].\n\nNow cell (3,3) is 0. Row3's missing numbers are 3 (since existing are 2,7,4,6,5,9,8,1). So missing is 3. Column3: existing numbers are row0:5, row1:4, row2:1, row3:0, row4:2, row5:0, row6:7, row7:0, row8:6. So column3 has 5,4,1,2,7,6. Missing are 3,8,9. So cell (3,3) must be 3. Check block (middle-center block, rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block: row3's columns 3-5: 0,6,5; row4's columns 3-5: 2,7,4; row5's columns 3-5: 0,8,0. Existing numbers are 6,5,2,7,4,8. Missing are 1,3,9. So cell (3,3) is 3. Yes. So cell (3,3) is 3. Now row3 becomes [2,7,4,3,6,5,9,8,1]. Row3 is complete.\n\nNow row4: [0, 8, 0, 2, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Let's look at this row. Let's check each cell.\n\nStarting with cell (4,0): 0. Row4's existing numbers: 8,2,7,4. Missing are 1,3,5,6,9. Column0: existing numbers are 4,1,5,2,3,6. Missing are 7,8,9. Wait, column0 has 4 (row0), 1 (row1), 5 (row2), 2 (row3), 0 (row4), 3 (row5), 0 (row6), 6 (row7), 0 (row8). So column0 has 4,1,5,2,3,6. Missing are 7,8,9. So row4's missing (for cell (4,0)) must be in column's missing (7,8,9). But row4's missing numbers are 1,3,5,6,9. The intersection is 9. So cell (4,0) must be 9. Let me check block. Cell (4,0) is in the middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers in that block are row3:2,7,4; row4:0,8,0; row5:3,0,5. Existing numbers are 2,7,4,8,3,5. Missing are 1,6,9. So 9 is possible. So cell (4,0) is 9. Now row4 becomes [9,8,0,2,7,4,0,0,0].\n\nNow cell (4,2) is 0. Row4's missing numbers now are 1,3,5,6 (since existing are 9,8,2,7,4). Column2: existing numbers are 6,7,8,4,5,2,3. Missing are 1,9. But row4's missing are 1,3,5,6. So intersection is 1. So cell (4,2) is 1. Check block (middle-left). Existing numbers include 9 (row4,0), so adding 1 here. The block's existing numbers are 2,7,4,9,8,3,5. Missing are 1,6. So yes, 1 is valid. So cell (4,2) is 1. Now row4 becomes [9,8,1,2,7,4,0,0,0].\n\nNow cell (4,6) is 0. Row4's missing numbers are 3,5,6. Column6: existing numbers are 1,5,4,9,2,6,8. Missing are 3,7. So intersection is 3. So cell (4,6) must be 3. Check block (middle-right block, rows 3-5, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block: row3:9,8,1; row4:0,0,0; row5:2,7,0. Existing numbers are 9,8,1,2,7. Missing are 3,4,5,6. So cell (4,6) is 3. Yes. So cell (4,6) is 3. Now row4 becomes [9,8,1,2,7,4,3,0,0].\n\nNow cell (4,7) and (4,8) are 0. Let's look at cell (4,7). Row4's missing numbers are 5,6. Column7: existing numbers are row0:2, row1:9, row2:3, row3:8, row4:0, row5:7, row6:5, row7:0, row8:1. So column7 has 2,9,3,8,7,5,1. Missing are 4,6. But row4's missing are 5,6. So intersection is 6. Therefore, cell (4,7) is 6. Check block (middle-right). Existing numbers in the block (rows 3-5, columns 6-8): row3:9,8,1; row4:3,0,0; row5:2,7,0. Adding 6 to cell (4,7). So yes. Now cell (4,7) is 6. Now row4 becomes [9,8,1,2,7,4,3,6,0].\n\nNow cell (4,8) is 0. Row4's missing number is 5. Column8: existing numbers are row0:7, row1:8, row2:6, row3:1, row4:0, row5:0, row6:9, row7:3, row8:2. So column8 has 7,8,6,1,9,3,2. Missing are 4,5. So cell (4,8) must be 5. Check block (middle-right). Adding 5 is okay. So cell (4,8) is 5. Now row4 becomes [9,8,1,2,7,4,3,6,5]. Row4 is complete.\n\nNow row5: [3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, 2, 7, 0]. Let's check each cell.\n\nStarting with cell (5,1): 0. Row5's existing numbers: 3,5,8,2,7. Missing are 1,4,6,9. Column1: existing numbers are 3,2,9,7,8,1,5. Missing are 4,6. So intersection is 4,6. Let's check block. Cell (5,1) is in middle-left block (rows 3-5, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: row3:2,7,4; row4:9,8,1; row5:3,0,5. Existing numbers are 2,7,4,9,8,1,3,5. Missing are 6. So cell (5,1) must be 6. Because the block needs 6. Let me check. Yes, row5's missing includes 6. Column1's possible are 4,6. But block's missing is 6. So cell (5,1) is 6. Now row5 becomes [3,6,5,0,8,0,2,7,0].\n\nNow cell (5,3) is 0. Row5's missing numbers now are 1,4,9 (since existing are 3,6,5,8,2,7). Column3: existing numbers are 5,4,1,3,2,7,6. Missing are 8,9. Wait, column3 has row0:5, row1:4, row2:1, row3:3, row4:2, row5:0, row6:7, row7:0, row8:6. So existing numbers are 5,4,1,3,2,7,6. Missing are 8,9. So row5's missing are 1,4,9. Intersection with column3's missing (8,9) is 9. So cell (5,3) is 9. Check block (middle-center block, rows 3-5, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block: row3:3,6,5; row4:2,7,4; row5:9,8,0. Existing numbers are 3,6,5,2,7,4,9,8. Missing is 1. Wait, but cell (5,3) is 9, which is allowed. Let me check the block. The block includes row5's columns 3-5: 9 (cell (5,3)), 8 (cell (5,4)), and 0 (cell (5,5)). So existing numbers in the block are 3,6,5,2,7,4,9,8. Missing is 1. But cell (5,3) is 9, which is okay. So yes, cell (5,3) is 9. Now row5 becomes [3,6,5,9,8,0,2,7,0].\n\nNow cell (5,5) is 0. Row5's missing numbers are 1,4 (since existing are 3,6,5,9,8,2,7). Column5: existing numbers are row0:8, row1:6, row2:7, row3:5, row4:4, row5:0, row6:0, row7:2, row8:0. So column5 has 8,6,7,5,4,2. Missing are 1,3,9. Row5's missing are 1,4. Intersection is 1. So cell (5,5) is 1. Check block (middle-center). Existing numbers in the block (rows 3-5, columns 3-5) include 9 (row5,3), 8 (row5,4), and 1 here. So yes. So cell (5,5) is 1. Now row5 becomes [3,6,5,9,8,1,2,7,0].\n\nNow cell (5,8) is 0. Row5's missing is 4. Column8: existing numbers are row0:7, row1:8, row2:6, row3:1, row4:5, row5:0, row6:9, row7:3, row8:2. Missing are 4. So cell (5,8) is 4. Now row5 becomes [3,6,5,9,8,1,2,7,4]. Row5 is complete.\n\nNow row6: [0, 1, 2, 7, 0, 0, 6, 5, 9]. Let's check each cell.\n\nCell (6,0): 0. Row6's existing numbers: 1,2,7,6,5,9. Missing are 3,4,8. Column0: existing numbers are 4,1,5,2,9,3,6. Missing are 7,8. Wait, column0 has row0:4, row1:1, row2:5, row3:2, row4:9, row5:3, row6:0, row7:6, row8:0. So existing numbers are 4,1,5,2,9,3,6. Missing are 7,8. So row6's missing numbers are 3,4,8. Intersection with column0's missing (7,8) is 8. So cell (6,0) is 8. Check block (bottom-left block, rows 6-8, columns 0-2). Existing numbers: row6:0,1,2; row7:6,5,0; row8:0,0,3. Existing numbers are 1,2,6,5,3. Adding 8 here. So yes. So cell (6,0) is 8. Now row6 becomes [8,1,2,7,0,0,6,5,9].\n\nNow cell (6,4) and (6,5) are 0. Let's look at cell (6,4). Row6's missing numbers are 3,4 (since existing are 8,1,2,7,6,5,9). Column4: existing numbers are 9,3,2,6,7,8,1,5. Missing are 4. Because column4 has row0:9, row1:3, row2:2, row3:6, row4:7, row5:8, row6:0, row7:1, row8:5. So existing numbers are 9,3,2,6,7,8,1,5. Missing is 4. So cell (6,4) must be 4. Check block (bottom-middle block, rows 6-8, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block: row6:7,0,0; row7:0,1,2; row8:6,5,0. Existing numbers are 7,1,2,6,5. Adding 4 in cell (6,4). So yes. Now cell (6,4) is 4. Now row6 becomes [8,1,2,7,4,0,6,5,9].\n\nNow cell (6,5) is 0. Row6's missing is 3. Column5: existing numbers are 8,6,7,5,4,1,2. Missing are 3,9. So cell (6,5) is 3. Check block (bottom-middle). Existing numbers include 3 now. Yes. So cell (6,5) is 3. Now row6 becomes [8,1,2,7,4,3,6,5,9]. Row6 is complete.\n\nNow row7: [6, 5, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 3]. Let's check each cell.\n\nStarting with cell (7,2): 0. Row7's existing numbers: 6,5,1,2,3. Missing are 4,7,8,9. Column2: existing numbers are 6,7,8,4,1,5,2,3. Missing are 9. Wait, column2 has row0:6, row1:7, row2:8, row3:4, row4:1, row5:5, row6:2, row7:0, row8:3. Existing numbers are 6,7,8,4,1,5,2,3. Missing is 9. So cell (7,2) must be 9. Check block (bottom-left block). Existing numbers in that block: row6:8,1,2; row7:6,5,0; row8:0,0,3. Existing numbers are 8,1,2,6,5,3. Adding 9 here. Yes. So cell (7,2) is 9. Now row7 becomes [6,5,9,0,1,2,0,0,3].\n\nNow cell (7,3) is 0. Row7's missing numbers are 4,7,8. Column3: existing numbers are 5,4,1,3,2,9,7,6. Missing are 8. Because column3 has row0:5, row1:4, row2:1, row3:3, row4:2, row5:9, row6:7, row7:0, row8:6. Existing numbers are 5,4,1,3,2,9,7,6. Missing is 8. So cell (7,3) must be 8. Check block (bottom-middle block, columns 3-5). Existing numbers in that block: row6:7,4,3; row7:8,1,2; row8:6,5,0. Existing numbers are 7,4,3,8,1,2,6,5. Missing is 9. But cell (7,3) is 8 which is valid. So yes. Now row7 becomes [6,5,9,8,1,2,0,0,3].\n\nNow cell (7,6) and (7,7) are 0. Let's look at cell (7,6). Row7's missing numbers are 4,7. Column6: existing numbers are 1,5,4,9,3,2,6,8. Missing are 7. Because column6 has row0:1, row1:5, row2:4, row3:9, row4:3, row5:2, row6:6, row7:0, row8:8. Existing numbers are 1,5,4,9,3,2,6,8. Missing is 7. So cell (7,6) must be 7. Check block (bottom-right block, rows 6-8, columns 6-8). Existing numbers in that block: row6:6,5,9; row7:0,0,3; row8:8,1,2. Existing numbers are 6,5,9,3,8,1,2. Missing are 4,7. So cell (7,6) is 7. Now row7 becomes [6,5,9,8,1,2,7,0,3].\n\nNow cell (7,7) is 0. Row7's missing is 4. Column7: existing numbers are 2,9,3,8,6,7,5,1. Missing are 4. So cell (7,7) is 4. Check block (bottom-right). Adding 4 is okay. Now row7 becomes [6,5,9,8,1,2,7,4,3]. Row7 is complete.\n\nNow row8: [0, 0, 3, 6, 5, 0, 8, 1, 2]. Let's check each cell.\n\nCell (8,0) and (8,1) and (8,5) are 0. Let's start with cell (8,0). Row8's existing numbers: 3,6,5,8,1,2. Missing are 4,7,9. Column0: existing numbers are 4,1,5,2,9,3,8,6.
