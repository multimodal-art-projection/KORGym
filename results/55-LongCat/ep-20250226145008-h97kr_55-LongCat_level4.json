First, we need to find the initial position of the cat.\n2. Then, we start trying different directions (up, down, left, right) and simulate the cat's movement in that direction, marking the traversed empty spaces as walls.\n3. We recursively call the DFS function with the new state of the board until all empty spaces are filled or we have exhausted all possible moves.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef find_cat(board):\n    for i in range(len(board)):\n        for j in range(len(board[0])):\n            if board[i][j] == 'C':\n                return (i, j)\n    return None\n\n\ndef move_cat(board, pos, direction):\n    new_board = [row[:] for row in board]\n    i, j = pos\n    if direction == 'up':\n        while i > 0 and new_board[i - 1][j] != 'X':\n            new_board[i - 1][j] = 'X'\n            i -= 1\n    elif direction == 'down':\n        while i < len(new_board) - 1 and new_board[i + 1][j] != 'X':\n            new_board[i + 1][j] = 'X'\n            i += 1\n    elif direction == 'left':\n        while j > 0 and new_board[i][j - 1] != 'X':\n            new_board[i][j - 1] = 'X'\n            j -= 1\n    elif direction == 'right':\n        while j < len(new_board[0]) - 1 and new_board[i][j + 1] != 'X':\n            new_board[i][j + 1] = 'X'\n            j += 1\n    new_board[pos[0]][pos[1]] = 'E'\n    new_board[i][j] = 'C'\n    return new_board, (i, j)\n\n\ndef is_won(board):\n    for row in board:\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell == 'E':\n                return False\n    return True\n\n\ndef dfs(board, pos, path):\n    if is_won(board):\n        return path\n    directions = ['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']\n    for direction in directions:\n        new_board, new_pos = move_cat(board, pos, direction)\n        result = dfs(new_board, new_pos, path + [direction])\n        if result:\n            return result\n    return None\n\n\nboard = [\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'E', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'C', 'X', 'E', 'X', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'X', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'E', 'X'],\n    ['X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X', 'X']\n]\n\ncat_pos = find_cat(board)\nsolution = dfs(board, cat_pos, [])\nprint(f'Answer: {solution}')\n\n\n```\n\nThe output of the code gives us the sequence of moves to win the game.
