Each time it moves, it turns empty spaces ('E') into walls ('X'). I win when all empty spaces are filled.\n\nLooking at the board:\n```\nX X X X X X X\nX E E E E E X\nX E E E X E X\nX E E X C E X\nX X X X X X X\n```\n\nThe cat ('C') is at position (3,3) (0-indexed). Let me analyze the possible moves:\n\n1. If I go \"up\", the cat will hit a wall after turning all the E's above it into X's.\n2. If I go \"down\", the cat will immediately hit a wall without filling any spaces.\n3. If I go \"left\", the cat will hit a wall after turning the E's to its left into X's.\n4. If I go \"right\", the cat will hit a wall after turning the E to its right into X.\n\nLet me plan the sequence:\n\n1. Start with \"up\" - This will fill the spaces directly above the cat\n2. Then \"left\" - This will fill spaces to the left on the second row\n3. Then \"down\" - This will fill spaces below on the left side\n4. Then \"right\" - This will fill the bottom row from left to right\n5. Finally \"up\" - This will fill any remaining spaces\n\nLet me trace through this:\n\nAfter \"up\":\n```\nX X X X X X X\nX E E X E E X\nX E E X X E X\nX E E X C E X\nX X X X X X X\n```\n\nAfter \"left\":\n```\nX X X X X X X\nX E E X E E X\nX X X X X E X\nX X X X C E X\nX X X X X X X\n```\n\nAfter \"down\" (cat doesn't move as it's already at a wall):\n```\nX X X X X X X\nX E E X E E X\nX X X X X E X\nX X X X C E X\nX X X X X X X\n```\n\nI need to reconsider my strategy. Let me try again:\n\n1. \"left\" - Fill the spaces to the left of the cat\n2. \"up\" - Fill spaces above the position I reach after going left\n3. \"right\" - Fill the top row from left to right\n4. \"down\" - Fill the right column from top to bottom\n5. \"left\" - Fill the bottom row from right to left\n\nThis should cover all spaces.
